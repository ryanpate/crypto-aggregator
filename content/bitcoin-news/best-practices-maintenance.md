# Best Practices & Maintenance

Security is a **process**, not a one-time setup.

## A. Regular Audits  
1. **Backup verification:** Perform dry-run recoveries on spare devices.  
2. **Firmware checks:** Confirm hardware wallets run latest signed firmware.  
3. **Seed integrity:** Inspect paper/metal backups for degradation.

## B. Recovery Drills  
- Schedule quarterly drills: restore from seed into a brand-new wallet.  
- Document every step in a secure procedure manual.

## C. Stay Informed  
- Follow security blogs (e.g. Trail of Bits, SlowMist).  
- Subscribe to vulnerability advisories for your wallet providers.  
- Join reputable forums and developer channels.
