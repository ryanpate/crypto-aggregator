# Physical Security Measures

Even perfectly managed keys are worthless if they’re stolen or destroyed.

## A. Secure Storage Options  

| Option                | Pros                        | Cons                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Home Safe             | Immediate access            | Risk of home break-in     |
| Bank Safe Deposit     | High security, insured      | Access only during bank hours |
| Secret Location       | Covert, plausible deniability | Difficult to retrieve quickly  |

## B. Decoy & Diversion Tactics  
- Maintain a **decoy wallet** with a small balance.  
- Label backups innocuously (e.g., “Vacation photos”) to deter thieves.

## C. Environmental Protections  
- Use **fireproof/waterproof** safes (UL Class 350).  
- Protect against humidity (silica desiccants).  
- Plan for natural disasters—store in multiple regions.
