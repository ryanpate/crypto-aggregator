## What Are NFTs?
NFTs are unique, indivisible tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of a distinct item or piece of content—whether digital art, a game asset, or a real-world collectible.

*Related: [Token Standards: ERC-20 & ERC-721](/ethereum/token-standards-erc20-erc721/)*

## ERC-721 vs ERC-1155
- **ERC-721:** Single-asset standard for unique tokens (e.g. CryptoKitties).  
- **ERC-1155:** Multi-asset standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens in one contract.

## Leading Marketplaces
- **OpenSea** – The largest NFT marketplace (ERC-721 & ERC-1155).  
- **Rarible** – Community-governed (RARI token) with on-chain royalties.  
- **Foundation** – Curated digital art platform.  
- **NBA Top Shot** – Licensed sports collectibles on Flow.

## Use Cases Beyond Art
- **Gaming:** In-game items & virtual land (Axie Infinity, Decentraland).  
- **Collectibles:** Sports cards, music releases, limited drops.  
- **Real-World Tokenization:** Real estate deeds, event tickets, luxury goods.

## Economics & Royalties
Smart contracts can automatically distribute a percentage of every secondary sale back to creators, ensuring ongoing revenue through programmable royalties.

## Risks & Best Practices
- **Smart Contract Audits:** Only mint or buy from audited contracts.  
- **Wash Trading:** Beware of artificial volume.  
- **Copyright & IP:** Verify the seller’s right to tokenize the asset.

## The Road Ahead
- **Cross-Chain NFTs:** Bridging between Ethereum, Solana, Flow.  
- **Fractional Ownership:** Splitting expensive NFTs into shareable tokens.  
- **Dynamic NFTs:** Assets that evolve with on-chain or real-world data.
