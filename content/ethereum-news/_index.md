# Understanding Ethereum: From Basics to NFTs

Ethereum is the world’s leading programmable blockchain. This pillar page will take you from the foundational concepts—what Ethereum is and how it works—to the groundbreaking world of smart contracts, token standards, DeFi, and the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## What Is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain featuring smart contract functionality. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it extends Bitcoin’s simple value transfer model with a full Turing-complete scripting language.

---

## How Ethereum Works

- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):** The runtime environment for smart contracts.  
- **Gas & Transactions:** Users pay “gas” fees to execute code and secure the network.  
- **Consensus:** Currently Proof-of-Work, transitioning fully to Proof-of-Stake (Ethereum 2.0).

---

## Smart Contracts & the EVM

Smart contracts are self-executing code stored on the Ethereum blockchain. They enable decentralized applications (“dApps”) by enforcing agreements without intermediaries.

- **Example:** A simple escrow contract releases funds when predefined conditions are met.  
- **Security:** Audits (e.g. OpenZeppelin) and formal verification help prevent exploits.

*Cluster article: [DeFi vs. CeFi](/defi/defi-vs-cefi/)*

---

## Token Standards: ERC-20 & ERC-721

- **ERC-20:** The token interface for fungible assets (USDC, UNI).  
- **ERC-721:** The standard for unique, non-fungible tokens (CryptoKitties, Bored Ape Yacht Club).  
- **ERC-1155:** Multi-token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens in one contract.

---

## The NFT Revolution

Non-fungible tokens brought digital ownership to art, gaming, and collectibles:

- **Use Cases:** Art marketplaces (OpenSea), in-game assets, event tickets.  
- **Royalties & Metadata:** Smart contracts can automatically pay creators on secondary sales.

## DeFi on Ethereum

Ethereum hosts the lion’s share of DeFi protocols:

- **Lending & Borrowing:** Aave, Compound  
- **AMMs:** Uniswap, SushiSwap  
- **Yield Aggregators:** Yearn.Finance  
- **Derivative Protocols:** Synthetix

*Cluster article: [Yield Farming & Liquidity Mining](/defi/yield-farming-liquidity-mining/)*

---

## Scaling & Layer 2 Solutions

To tackle high gas fees and congestion, Ethereum employs:

- **Rollups:** Optimistic (Optimism) & ZK (zkSync) for batching transactions off-chain.  
- **Sidechains:** Polygon, xDai for faster, cheaper transactions.  
- **Sharding (Eth2):** Upcoming multi-shard architecture to massively increase throughput.

---

## Risks & Security

- **Smart Contract Bugs:** Always audit before bonding large sums.  
- **Oracle Manipulation:** Price-feed attacks can drain pools.  
- **High Gas Fees:** Can make small transactions uneconomical.

## Getting Started with Ethereum

1. **Install a Wallet:** MetaMask (browser), Trust Wallet (mobile).  
2. **Acquire ETH:** Use a centralized exchange (Coinbase, Binance).  
3. **Connect to dApps:** Visit Uniswap, OpenSea, Aave.  
4. **Monitor Gas:** Use tools like [ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info).
