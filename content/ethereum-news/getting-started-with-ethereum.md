# Getting Started with Ethereum

New to Ethereum? Follow these steps to begin interacting with the world’s leading smart-contract platform:

## 1. Install a Wallet  
Choose a non-custodial wallet to hold your ETH and interact with dApps:  
- **MetaMask (Extension & Mobile)** – Easiest for browser-based dApps.  
- **Trust Wallet (Mobile)** – Multi-chain support and in-app dApp browser.  
- **Argent (Mobile)** – Built-in social recovery and DeFi integrations.

## 2. Acquire ETH  
You’ll need ether (ETH) to pay gas fees and transact on Ethereum:  
1. Register on a centralized exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken).  
2. Complete KYC/AML verification.  
3. Purchase ETH with fiat (USD, EUR) or another crypto.  
4. Withdraw to your wallet address.

## 3. Connect to dApps  
With ETH in your wallet, you can now explore decentralized applications:  
- **Uniswap** – Swap tokens directly from your wallet.  
- **OpenSea** – Browse and mint NFTs.  
- **Aave** – Lend or borrow assets.  
- **Compound** – Earn interest on deposits.

> In your wallet UI, click **“Connect”** or **“Select Wallet”**, choose your wallet, and approve the connection.

## 4. Monitor Gas & Network Status  
Transaction fees (“gas”) fluctuate with network demand:  
- **ETH Gas Station** (ethgasstation.info) – Real-time fee estimates.  
- **Etherscan Gas Tracker** – View pending transactions and congestion.  

Set your gas price according to urgency (low/standard/fast) to balance cost vs. speed.

## 5. Best Practices & Security  
- **Backup Your Seed Phrase** – Write it down offline; never share it.  
- **Use Hardware Wallets** – Store large balances on Ledger/Trezor.  
- **Verify URLs** – Always check you’re on the official dApp site to avoid phishing.  
- **Enable Two-Factor Auth** on exchanges and services where available.
