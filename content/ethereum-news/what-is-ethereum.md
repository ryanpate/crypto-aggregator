# What Is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy **smart contracts** and **decentralized applications (dApps)**. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it extends beyond simple peer-to-peer value transfer—like Bitcoin—to offer a full **Turing-complete** scripting environment.

## Key Components

1. **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):**  
   - The runtime environment for smart contracts on every node in the network.  
   - Ensures code executes identically across all participants.

2. **Ether (ETH):**  
   - The native cryptocurrency used to pay **gas fees** for transactions and contract executions.  
   - Serves as the economic incentive securing the network.

3. **Gas & Transactions:**  
   - **Gas** measures computational work; users set `gasPrice` to prioritize their transactions.  
   - Miners (PoW) or validators (PoS) include transactions in blocks, earning gas fees.

4. **Consensus Mechanism:**  
   - Originally **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**, transitioning to **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** with Ethereum 2.0 (the “Merge”).  
   - PoS validators stake ETH to propose and attest new blocks, reducing energy consumption.

## Why Ethereum Matters

- **Smart Contracts:** Self-executing agreements enforceable on-chain without intermediaries.  
- **dApp Ecosystem:** DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, and more—all running atop Ethereum.  
- **Network Effects:** Largest developer community and richest set of tooling (Truffle, Hardhat, Remix).

## Ethereum vs. Bitcoin

| Feature               | Bitcoin                                  | Ethereum                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Purpose               | Digital gold, value transfer             | Programmable blockchain, dApps & DeFi    |
| Consensus             | PoW                                      | PoW → PoS (Beacon Chain / The Merge)      |
| Scripting Language    | Very limited (Script)                    | Turing-complete (Solidity, Vyper, etc.)  |
| Block Time            | ~10 minutes                              | ~12 seconds                              |

## Popular Use Cases

- **DeFi Lending & Exchanges:** Aave, Uniswap  
- **NFT Minting & Marketplaces:** OpenSea, Rarible  
- **DAOs & Governance:** Compound governance, MakerDAO  
- **Token Standards:**  
  - ERC-20 (fungible tokens)  
  - ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens)  
  - ERC-1155 (multi-token standard)

## Getting Started

1. **Install a Wallet:** MetaMask or Trust Wallet.  
2. **Acquire ETH:** Through centralized exchanges like Coinbase.  
3. **Explore dApps:** Try simple swaps on Uniswap or experiment with an NFT mint.  
4. **Learn Solidity:** Use Remix IDE to write and deploy your first smart contract.
