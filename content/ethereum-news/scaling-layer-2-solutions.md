# Scaling & Layer 2 Solutions

As Ethereum adoption grows, the network faces throughput limits and rising gas fees. Layer 2 (L2) solutions and Ethereum 2.0 upgrades aim to address these challenges:

## 1. Rollups

### Optimistic Rollups  
- **How they work:** Batch transactions off-chain, post a “compressed” proof on Layer 1, and assume validity unless fraud is proven.  
- **Examples:** Optimism, Arbitrum One.  
- **Pros/Cons:** Near-L1 security; 7-day withdrawal delays for fraud proofs.

### ZK (Zero-Knowledge) Rollups  
- **How they work:** Generate succinct cryptographic proofs (SNARKs/ STARKs) that off-chain batches are valid.  
- **Examples:** zkSync, StarkNet.  
- **Pros/Cons:** Fast finality & withdrawals; more complex prover infrastructure.

## 2. Sidechains

- **Definition:** Independent blockchains running EVM-compatible nodes secured by their own validator set.  
- **Examples:** Polygon PoS, xDai, BNB Chain.  
- **Trade-offs:** Lower fees & fast txns but rely on the sidechain’s security model.

## 3. Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) Sharding

- **Beacon Chain & Merge:** Transition from PoW to PoS via the Beacon Chain (launched Dec 2020) and The Merge (Sep 2022).  
- **Sharding Roadmap:** Future split of the Ethereum state into 64 shards to parallelize transaction processing.  
- **Benefits:** Dramatically increased throughput and data availability for rollups.

## 4. Hybrid Approaches & Emerging L2s

- **Validium:** Off-chain data with ZK proofs (e.g., StarkEx).  
- **Layer 2 Aggregators:** Matter Labs’ zkSync 2.0 combining rollups + data availability.  
- **Interoperability:** Cross-rollup messaging standards (e.g., Hyperlane, Connext).

## 5. How to Try Layer 2 Today

1. **Bridge assets:** Use official bridges (Polygon Bridge, Arbitrum Bridge) to move ETH/USDC onto L2.  
2. **Adjust your wallet:** Add the Layer 2 network RPC in MetaMask.  
3. **Use L2-native dApps:** Try Uniswap on Arbitrum, 1inch on zkSync, or Aave on Optimism.  
4. **Monitor security:** Check that bridges and protocols are audited and actively maintained.
