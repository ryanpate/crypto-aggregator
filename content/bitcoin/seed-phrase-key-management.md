# Seed Phrase & Key Management

Your seed phrase is the **master key** to all your funds. Protect it accordingly.

## A. Generating a Secure Seed  
1. Use **offline** or air-gapped devices.  
2. Prefer hardware-wallet-generated seeds over software.  
3. Choose at least **24 words** for extra entropy.

## B. Recording & Storage

### 1. Paper  
- Use acid-free paper and permanent ink.  
- Store in a fire- and waterproof safe.

### 2. Metal Plates  
- Engrave or stamp your seed into stainless steel (Cryptosteel, Billfodl).  
- Resistant to fire, water, and crushing.

### 3. Geo-Redundancy  
- Keep at least **two** copies in separate, secure locations.  
- Consider a safe-deposit box plus a home safe.

## C. Rotation & Recovery Testing  
1. **Rotate seeds** if ever exposed, even briefly.  
2. **Dry-run recovery**: Import your backup on a spare device to confirm it works.
