# Preventing Common Attacks

Awareness is your first line of defense.

## A. Phishing & UI-Spoofing  
1. Always verify URLs (bookmark real sites).  
2. Use DNS-level blockers (Pi-Hole, NextDNS).  
3. Enable **two-factor auth** (2FA) with hardware keys (YubiKey).

## B. Malware & Keyloggers  
1. Run up-to-date **anti-malware** software.  
2. Use dedicated, air-gapped machines for high-value signing.  
3. Avoid downloading unknown email attachments or software.

## C. SIM Swap & Social Engineering  
1. **Port-out protection:** Ask your carrier to add extra PIN/2FA.  
2. Beware unsolicited calls/textsâ€”never reveal 2FA codes.  
3. Use email accounts with hardware 2FA for recovery.
