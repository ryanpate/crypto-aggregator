# Understanding Wallet Types

Choosing the right wallet is Step 1 in safeguarding your Bitcoin. We divide wallets into two broad categories:

## 1. Hot Wallets  
**Definition:** Connected to the internet and ideal for frequent transactions.  
**Examples:**  
- **Mobile:** BlueWallet, Mycelium  
- **Desktop:** Electrum  
- **Browser extensions:** MetaMask (with Bitcoin-compatible networks)  

**Pros & Cons**  
| Pros                     | Cons                               |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Instant access           | Vulnerable to malware & phishing   |
| Easy setup & recovery    | Private keys stored on connected device |

### Recommended Setup Steps  
1. **Download** from the official site or app store.  
2. **Set a strong PIN** or passphrase.  
3. **Enable biometric** unlock if available.  
4. **Backup** any recovery seed to offline storage.

## 2. Cold Wallets  
**Definition:** Offline devices that store private keys without ever touching the internet.  
**Examples:** Ledger Nano, Trezor, paper wallets, air-gapped machines.

**Pros & Cons**  
| Pros                          | Cons                             |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Near-immune to online hacks   | Less convenient for everyday use |
| Hardware storage of keys      | Requires careful physical security |

### Cold-Storage Best Practices  
1. **Purchase devices** new and sealed from official retailers.  
2. **Initialize offline** or on an air-gapped computer.  
3. **Write down** your recovery seed on fire-resistant paper or metal.  
4. **Verify** firmware authenticity before sending any funds.
