# DeFi on Ethereum

Ethereum has become the epicenter of decentralized finance, hosting a rich ecosystem of protocols that enable lending, borrowing, trading, staking, and synthetic assets. Below we explore the major categories and platforms:

## 1. Lending & Borrowing

- **Aave**  
  - Flash loans, gasless approvals, rate switching  
  - *Cluster article:* [Aave Guide](/defi/top-defi-protocols/#aave)

- **Compound**  
  - cTokens, algorithmic interest rates, COMP governance  
  - *Cluster article:* [Compound Tutorial](/defi/top-defi-protocols/#compound)

## 2. Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

- **Uniswap**  
  - Constant Product AMM (x·y=k), permissionless pools  
  - *Cluster article:* [Uniswap Tutorial](/defi/top-defi-protocols/#uniswap)

- **SushiSwap**  
  - Onsen incentives, xSUSHI staking, BentoBox  
  - *Cluster article:* [SushiSwap Review](/defi/top-defi-protocols/#sushiswap)

- **Curve Finance**  
  - StableSwap for low-slippage stablecoin swaps  
  - *Cluster article:* [Curve Finance Overview](/defi/top-defi-protocols/#curve-finance)

## 3. Yield Aggregators

- **Yearn.Finance**  
  - Vaults that auto-optimize yield across protocols  
  - *Cluster article:* [Yield Farming & Liquidity Mining](/defi/yield-farming-liquidity-mining)

- **Harvest Finance**  
  - Community-driven vaults, auto-compound strategies

## 4. Derivatives & Synthetics

- **Synthetix**  
  - Mint synthetic assets (sUSD, sBTC) backed by SNX staking  
  - On-chain oracles and decentralized exchange

## 5. Risk Management

- Overcollateralization requirements  
- Protocol-specific safety modules (e.g., Aave’s Safety Module)  
- Insurance options (Nexus Mutual, Cover Protocol)

## 6. How to Get Started

1. **Connect your wallet** (MetaMask, WalletConnect)  
2. **Deposit collateral** (ETH or stablecoins) into Aave or Compound  
3. **Provide liquidity** on Uniswap or Curve for trading fees and token incentives  
4. **Explore vaults** on Yearn to auto-compound rewards  
5. **Monitor positions** with DeFi dashboards (Zapper, DeBank)
