# Risks & Security in Ethereum

While Ethereum powers a vast ecosystem of dApps and DeFi, it also presents unique attack surfaces. This article covers:

## 1. Smart Contract Exploits  
- **Reentrancy** (e.g. DAO hack)  
- **Unchecked External Calls** (delegatecall pitfalls)  
- **Integer Over/Underflow** (Solidity ≥0.8 mitigations)

## 2. Oracle & Price-Feed Manipulation  
- **Flash-loan Attacks**: borrow to skew on-chain prices  
- **Mitigation**: time-weighted-average-price (TWAP), multi-oracle networks (Chainlink)

## 3. Miner/Validator Risks  
- **51% Attack**: double-spend risk on smaller chains or sidechains  
- **Block Withholding & MEV**: front-running, sandwich attacks—use transaction ordering services or private pools

## 4. Network Congestion & Gas Wars  
- **Gas Spikes**: NFT drops or popular launches can spike fees and stall txns  
- **Mitigation**: use gas-price estimation tools, opt for Layer 2 when possible

## 5. Protocol Upgrade Vulnerabilities  
- **Hard Forks & Consensus Bugs**: unexpected chain splits or faulty consensus logic  
- **Mitigation**: staggered roll-out, community testnets, formal verification

## 6. Key/Wallet Security  
- **Phishing & UI-Spoofing**: always verify contract addresses in your wallet  
- **Seed-Phrase Protection**: offline storage and hardware wallets

## 7. Best Practices & Tools  
1. **Audit & Review**: rely on audited contracts and reputable teams  
2. **Insurance**: Nexus Mutual, Etherisc cover for smart-contract risk  
3. **Monitoring**: use on-chain analytics (Etherscan alerts, Tenderly)  
4. **Defensive Coding**: follow OpenZeppelin patterns, use standardized libraries
