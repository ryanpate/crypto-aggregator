# Smart Contracts & the EVM

Smart contracts are the backbone of Ethereum’s programmable blockchain. This article covers how contracts are written, compiled, and executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), plus key security and optimization considerations.

## 1. What Is a Smart Contract?
- **Definition:** Self-executing code deployed on-chain that enforces agreements and logic without intermediaries.
- **Languages:** Predominantly Solidity, but also Vyper and others.
- **Use Cases:** Token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721), DeFi protocols, DAOs, NFTs, and more.

## 2. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- **Role:** A sandboxed runtime for executing smart contract bytecode on every Ethereum node.
- **Determinism:** Ensures identical contract execution results across the network.
- **Isolation:** Contracts cannot access external resources directly, preserving security.

## 3. Contract Lifecycle
1. **Write & Compile:** Solidity source → EVM bytecode via `solc` or Remix.
2. **Deploy:** Send a transaction containing bytecode to the network; pay gas for deployment.
3. **Invoke:** Call functions via transactions (state-changing) or `eth_call` (view-only).
4. **Destruct (optional):** Self-destruct functions can remove contract code and refund gas.

## 4. Gas Mechanics & Cost Optimization
- **Gas:** Unit measuring computational effort; `gasPrice` × `gasUsed` = ETH fee.
- **Gas Limits:** Block and transaction gas limits restrict complexity.
- **Optimization Tips:**
  - Minimize storage writes (costliest).
  - Use `immutable` and `constant` keywords for fixed data.
  - Avoid loops over large arrays.

## 5. Security Best Practices
- **Reentrancy Guards:** Use mutexes (e.g., OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard`).
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize parameters and use `require` checks.
- **Safe Math:** Prevent overflow/underflow with built-in Solidity >=0.8 or libraries.
- **Audits & Formal Verification:** Engage third-party audits and consider verification tools.

## 6. Popular Frameworks & Tooling
- **Remix IDE:** Browser-based development and testing.
- **Hardhat & Truffle:** Local development, testing, and deployment pipelines.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Battle-tested libraries for secure, upgradeable contracts.

## 7. Advanced Topics
- **Upgradeable Contracts:** Proxy patterns for contract logic upgrades.
- **Layer 2 & EVM-Compatible Chains:** Execute EVM bytecode on Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon.
- **Gas Tokens & Refunds:** Techniques to store gas when prices are low.
