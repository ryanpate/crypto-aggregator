**Midweek Crypto Check-In from Bald Head Island**  

Hey fam, welcome to your **midweek crypto update** from Bald Head Island — where a **crypto market check-in** by the beach reveals **Bitcoin price trends** holding near $103k and an **Ethereum staking update** rolling out smoothly. **XRP ETF news** continues to stir traders, **Litecoin trading insights** netted a small win at $163, and **Dogecoin rally analysis** proves meme momentum is alive under the sun.

1. **Bitcoin**  
   Still cruising near \$103k—up about 1% since Friday. Those bank custody rumors turned out less “now or never” and more “slow-and-steady,” so BTC’s just vibing.

2. **Ethereum**  
   Hanging around \$2,620. The staking update on Sunday shipped without a hitch, but it only nudged ETH up 0.5%. DeFi TVL’s climbing though, so momentum could build into next week.

3. **XRP**  
   Flirted with \$2.15 on Monday but then settled back to \$2.10—so +1.5% overall. Still waiting on fresh ETF noise to swing it harder.

4. **Litecoin (LTC)**  
   My small buy at \$158 is looking decent: LTC’s now \$163 (+3%). Not a moon shot, but a nice beachside mini win.

5. **Dogecoin (DOGE)**  
   The “meme power” dip-buy paid off—DOGE ticked up from \$0.28 to \$0.30 (+7%). Seems Elon’s cryptic hints still get heads turning.

**Quick Take:**  
Markets are mellow enough that you could trade from a beach chair—just don’t forget your SPF. I’m logging off again to chase some waves, but if the weekend brings fresh catalysts, I’ll send a postcard… or at least a tweet. Catch you all next update—hopefully with a tan and another positive P&L!
