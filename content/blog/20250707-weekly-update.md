## 1. Bitcoin & Fed Minutes: Dance of the Doves

Last Wednesday’s Federal Reserve minutes signaled another **“pause”** on rate hikes—good news for risk assets. Bitcoin bounced from \$113,500 back toward \$116K, but next week it will likely shake out between **\$112K–\$118K** as traders digest Chair comments on inflation.

- **Prediction:** If BTC closes above **\$117K** on Monday, a run to **\$122K** is on the table.  
- **Author’s Take:** I’ll scale into \$112K–\$113K dips with small longs, then trim 20% at \$118K.  
- **Affiliate Tip:** Need a reliable exchange for quick orders? [Sign up for Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/ryanpate) and snag \$10 in BTC on your first \$100 buy.

## 2. Ethereum & Layer-2 Buzz

Ethereum is flirting with **\$2,800** after yesterday’s EIP-4844 testnet success. With several Layer-2 teams promising zkEVM mainnets next week, ETH could break \$2,900—but if gas fees spike, watch for a fallback to \$2,750.

- **Prediction:** \$2,750 support hold → squeeze to \$2,920 by Wednesday.  
- **Author’s Take:** I’ll park 30% of my ETH in Kraken’s staking pool for ~6% APY while riding the price wave.

## 3. Altcoin Spotlight: LINK & MATIC

### Chainlink (LINK)  
Oracle king LINK is up 12% after announcing **Cross-Chain Data Feeds**—if volume holds above \$250M, linkage to DeFi protocols could push it from **\$22** to **\$25**.

### Polygon (MATIC)  
Polygon’s zkEVM preview launch is due Thursday. Expect a pump to **\$1.50** if testnet metrics mirror mainnet speeds; otherwise, a consolidation back to \$1.35 is likely.

- **Author’s Take:** I’ll DCA into LINK at \$21.50 and MATIC at \$1.40 with small positions—treat them as my DeFi beta exposure.

## 4. DeFi & TVL Trends

Aave v3 is rumored to drop **eMode pools** next Monday—those high-efficiency borrow/lend baskets could draw \$200M+ in fresh TVL. Keep an eye on the **AAVE/USDC** pair: a breakout above **\$265** signals a killer weekend launch play.

- **Author’s Take:** I’ll allocate 10% of my capital to Aave v3 launch pools on Monday morning.  
- **Affiliate Tip:** Use [1inch DEX](https://app.1inch.io/?ref=ryanpate) for gas-optimized swap routing into AAVE.

2. **Set Alerts:**  
   - BTC: \$112K / \$118K  
   - ETH: \$2,750 / \$2,920  
   - LINK: \$22 / \$25  
3. **Stagger Entries:** Split orders into 3 slices to minimize slippage.
