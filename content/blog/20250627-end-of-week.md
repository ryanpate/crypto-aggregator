*Sweating through triple-digit temps in the Midwest this week!*

Hey everyone, Ryan here—your friendly neighborhood crypto enthusiast who’s part human, part puddle in this Midwest heatwave. As we slide into the weekend, here’s a breezy roundup of what’s been shaking in the markets, which headlines are steering those moves, and exactly which coins I’ll be tinkering with (or trimming) over the next couple of days.

By midweek, CNBC was buzzing about the Fed pausing rate hikes—a move that sent Bitcoin from \$109K all the way up to \$112K as traders cheered the promise of cheaper money for risk assets. Not long after, Reuters reported oil prices easing when tensions in the Strait of Hormuz cooled off, and we saw Ether dip from \$2,820 down to \$2,760 before stabilizing just above \$2,800. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s scoop on cashback incentives for small crypto buys on popular trading apps has retail volume bubbling up—so don’t be surprised if altcoins get a weekend bump from newcomers chasing those perks.

On the crypto-news front, CoinDesk data shows U.S. spot-Bitcoin ETFs still pulling in over \$150 million each day, reinforcing that institutional demand is very much alive and well. On-chain, we’re seeing dip-buyers defend \$110K in BTC and \$2,780 in ETH like it’s a championship match. Glassnode analytics also highlight that whales haven’t budged their BTC in over a month, so they’re clearly in this for the long haul through market twists and turns.

So, here’s where I’m putting my chips as the week wraps up:

1. **Bitcoin (BTC)**  
   Holding above \$112K has been a healthy sign, but I’m ready to scale into small longs if we revisit \$110K with strong volume. My stop sits at \$108K—break that, and I’ll shift to USDC until things calm down.

2. **Ethereum (ETH)**  
   After that swift on-chain upgrade, ETH’s been flirting with \$2,850. I’ll be looking to buy around \$2,780, then stake half in Lido for a ~4% yield while the rest chases a move back to \$2,920.

3. **XRP**  
   XRP’s resilience in the \$2.10–\$2.15 zone has been impressive. If it slips to \$2.05, I’ll add a hedge position; if it pops above \$2.20 on renewed legal clarity or ETF rumors, I’ll top up my core holding.

4. **High-Beta Altcoins**  
   Solana’s +5% on that big NFT drop, but I’ll scalp above \$75 only if the heat persists. Avalanche took a hit on network slowdown chatter—I'll sit out AVAX until I see on-chain metrics bounce back.

Expect weekend volume surges as retail traders dive in, and maybe a late-night show mention of Bitcoin to add some extra popcorn-factor. Meanwhile, I’ll be here monitoring levels, adjusting stops, and hoping my fan survives this heatwave.

**Key Levels to Watch:**  
- BTC: \$110K support / \$115K resistance  
- ETH: \$2,780 support / \$2,920 resistance  
- XRP: \$2.05 support / \$2.20 resistance  
- SOL: \$70–\$80 swing zone  

Stay hydrated—both you and your portfolios—and trade smart. See you Monday with the post-weekend wrap-up and (hopefully) some cool charts!
