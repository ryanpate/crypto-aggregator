*Caption: Charts don’t lie—but they sure can dance! Let’s see where BTC and ETH might boogie next.*

The million-dollar question (or, let’s be realistic, the six-figure one): **Where are Bitcoin and Ethereum heading in July 2025?** I’ve combed through expert notes, on-chain data, and a few YouTube rabbit holes—here’s the skinny, with a dash of humor and some affiliate gear to get you set up.

## Bitcoin Price Prediction: $110K–$143K Range?

- **Ed Campbell’s 25% Rally Thesis**  
  Rosenberg Research’s Ed Campbell reckons that if BTC can clear **\$114,000** resistance, a **25% surge to \$143,000** is possible—thanks to dwindling post-halving supply, fresh ETF flows, and a friendlier U.S. regulatory breeze  [oai_citation:0‡businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-forecast-btc-technical-analysis-rally-2025-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- **Bitwise $120K Target**  
  Bitwise analysts keep a **\$120,000 July** forecast on the board, driven by record ETF inflows and the looming Fed rate cuts putting wind in Bitcoin’s sails  [oai_citation:1‡tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/news/coinpedia%3A61e1e2984094b%3A0-bitwise-says-bitcoin-price-could-hit-120k-in-july/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- **Moderate Outlook of \$115K**  
  A June 2025 Finance Magnates report pegs a **\$115,000** mid-summer pivot under “moderate” scenarios—perfect for those who like to plan their beach buys ahead of high tide  [oai_citation:2‡financemagnates.com](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/bitcoin-sets-record-close-in-june-with-july-btc-price-predictions-target-115k/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- **Conservative 2–3% Upside**  
  CoinDCX’s weekly analysis suggests a **2–3% bump** to **\$110,000** if BTC holds above \$107,000 daily EMAs, with a slip below **\$103,700** kicking off a retest of the \$100K zone  [oai_citation:3‡coindcx.com](https://coindcx.com/blog/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-weekly/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**Why I’m Leaning Bullish:** The confluence of technical breakouts, institutional ETF stacking, and a summer lull in news means lower volatility—but higher conviction. My play? Scale small longs between **\$107K–\$110K**, aiming for **\$120K** stops at **\$114K**.

## Ethereum Price Forecast: \$2,500–\$3,000 (or Beyond?)

- **Changelly’s \$2,508 Projection**  
  Changelly’s mid-year model sees ETH popping from \$2,437 to **\$2,508** by early July, buoyed by DeFi TVL gains and upcoming EIP proposals  [oai_citation:4‡changelly.com](https://changelly.com/blog/ethereum-eth-price-predictions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- **Bearish \$2,000–\$1,850 Warning**  
  Bitpanda flags a potential retrace to **\$2,000**, even **\$1,850**, if DeFi incentives cool off or gas fees spike unexpectedly  [oai_citation:5‡bitpanda.com](https://www.bitpanda.com/academy/en/lessons/ethereum-forecast-2025-trends-scenarios-and-expert-opinions?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- **CoinStats’ \$5,925 Dream**  
  On the more optimistic end, CoinStats’ community forecast pushes ETH toward **\$5,925** by year-end 2025—as staking yields and layer-2 rollouts fuel renewed demand  [oai_citation:6‡coinstats.app](https://coinstats.app/news/e305e0b4765dc799f6bb9efd836989120fcdcf81cbd50230321dbbdacf1f5afc_Ethereum-ETH-Price-Prediction-2025-2026--2030-Will-Ethereum-Price-Hit-3k/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- **Bitget’s \$3,000 Hurdle**  
  Bitget’s analysts argue that clearing **\$3,000** in July could set the stage for a sustained rally into Q4—so watch for gas wars and staking flows on Dune Analytics  [oai_citation:7‡bitget.com](https://www.bitget.com/academy/ethereum-eth-price-prediction-latest-news-july-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**Why I’m Bullish (with Caution):** Ethereum’s real-world use cases—from NFT drops to DeFi farms—offer strong fundamental support. I’ll nibble around **\$2,450–\$2,500** with a tight stop at **\$2,400**, eyeing a sprint to **\$2,750** if EIP chatter and L2 rollout stay on schedule.

## Weekend Trading Strategy

1. **Set Smart Alerts:**  
   - **BTC:** \$114K breakout / \$107K support  
   - **ETH:** \$2,750 resistance / \$2,450 support  

2. **Scale Into Dips:** DCA into orders rather than all-in—chunk buys every \$1,000 for BTC and \$50 for ETH.

3. **Lock in Profits:** If you hit the midpoints (\$120K BTC / \$2,750 ETH), consider partial profit-taking for a guilt-free BBQ fund.

4. **Stay Hydrated & Humorous:** Crypto can be a circus—bring the popcorn, but don’t get wooed by FOMO clowns.

**Final Thoughts:**  
Price predictions are part art, part science, and part wild speculation—so take them with a grain of salt (and maybe a shot of tequila if that’s your style). Between expert forecasts, on-chain clues, and a touch of summer whimsy, this weekend’s outlook is bright. May your orders fill, your stops honor, and your coffee stay strong. 🚀
