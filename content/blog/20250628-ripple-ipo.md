*Caption: Investors buzz about Ripple Labs’ possible IPO after major share buybacks.*

Hey crew, Ryan here—back from battling Midwestern heat to dive into the hottest topic in crypto-land: the rumor mill around a Ripple Labs IPO. Between massive share buybacks, celebrity lawyer predictions, and whispers of Wall Street filings, investors are wondering when (or if) Ripple will go public—and what that means for XRP.

## Share Buyback Sparks Fresh IPO Chatter  
Ripple’s recent \$700 million share repurchase at \$175 per share sent shockwaves through crypto Twitter, implying a company valuation north of \$30 billion  [zycrypto.com](https://zycrypto.com/speculation-around-ripple-ipo-skyrockets-heres-what-this-means-for-xrp/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). That move, executed at a 135 % premium over market prices, screams confidence—and has everyone asking: “Is the IPO next?” Mainstream outlets like AInvest highlighted how CEO Brad Garlinghouse insisted an IPO isn’t top priority, but this buyback puts a timeline back on the table  [ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/xrp-news-today-ripple-announces-700-million-buyback-sparking-ipo-speculation-2506/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## $100 B Valuation? John Deaton Weighs In  
Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton recently suggested that a Ripple IPO could command a staggering \$100 billion valuation—far eclipsing peers like Circle, which surged from a \$5 billion to \$63 billion market cap post-IPO  [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc%3Aaf4b76dc5094b%3A0-deaton-says-ripple-ipo-could-trigger-100b-valuation-how-high-will-the-xrp-price-be/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Deaton’s bullish forecast rests on Ripple’s \$3.7 billion cash reserves, zero debt, and 41 billion XRP holdings, which at spot prices total roughly \$94 billion in assets  [bitcoinist.com](https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ipo-deaton-100-billion-valuation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Timeline: 2025 Unlikely, 2026 Maybe  
Despite the hype, experts caution an IPO in 2025 remains unlikely. AccessIPOS notes Brad Garlinghouse himself said an IPO “has not been a high priority” and that, once decided, a public offering typically takes twelve months to execute  [accessipos.com](https://accessipos.com/ripple-ipo-stock/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Ripple’s President Monica Long confirmed in April that 2025 isn’t on the cards, citing strong cash reserves and no urgent need for external funding  [financemagnates.com](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/xrp-trades-in-range-ripple-president-confirms-it-will-not-go-public-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Broader Crypto IPO Trends  
Ripple isn’t alone in IPO speculation—Circle’s blockbuster debut (surging from \$31 to \$134 in days) has set the stage for others like Gemini, Kraken, and even OpenSea to explore public markets  [barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/circle-stock-crypto-ipo-gemini-ripple-kraken-trump-6712ba41?utm_source=chatgpt.com). CryptoBasic’s angel investor Dennis Liu argues that a Ripple IPO could “open the floodgates” for XRP adoption, drawing parallels with Circle’s \$25 billion post-IPO valuation  [thecryptobasic.com](https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/16/angel-investor-says-ripple-ipo-could-open-the-floodgates-for-xrp-as-circle-hits-25b-post-ipo-valuation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). And according to the FT, Circle’s SPAC attempt failed, but its traditional IPO success underscores both opportunity and risk for crypto firms  [ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/269a9260-7445-4b44-9b84-82dcdfc3c92e?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## What This Means for XRP Investors  
- **Valuation upside:** If Ripple commands anywhere near \$100 billion, XRP holders could see renewed demand as the token becomes core collateral on the public balance sheet.  
- **Price catalysts:** Major announcements—filed S-1, underwriter selection, or SEC clearance—could trigger 20–30 % short-term pumps.  
- **Risk factors:** Regulatory delays (SEC uncertainties), market sentiment shifts, or a tepid buyback response could lead to swift retracements.

## My Weekend Watchlist  
1. **XRP price action around \$2.10–\$2.30**: zone to gauge investor conviction ahead of any IPO rumors.  
2. **ETF flows vs. share repurchase volumes**: comparing institutional spot-BTC inflows with Ripple’s buybacks for relative demand signals.  
3. **Regulatory updates**: any SEC commentary or amendments to Form S-1 filings that hint at timeline changes.

Whether we see a Ripple IPO by 2026 or it remains just another crypto unicorn story, this week’s blockbuster buyback and legal endorsements have set the stage for one of the most anticipated listings in blockchain history. Stay tuned, stay cool (literally—this Midwest heat is relentless), and I’ll catch you for the next deep dive!
