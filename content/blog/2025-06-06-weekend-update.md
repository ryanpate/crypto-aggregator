Hey everyone, welcome to your **weekend crypto vibes** update! We’ve got some **weekend crypto picks** lined up, from a surge in **Bitcoin custody services update** buzz to watching **Ethereum staking rewards** roll out smoothly. XRP is flirting with **ETF resistance** near $2.12, and I’m eyeing a **Litecoin low-key play** around $160. Plus, I couldn’t resist a bit of **Dogecoin meme power** after Elon’s cryptic tweet—and of course, this is all brought to you from my upcoming **vacation crypto commentary** spot.

On a totally unrelated note, I’m off next week for some much-needed R&R—think sun, sand, and zero price charts to watch. I’ll still peek at headlines if I can (FOMO is real), but the goal is to sip a cold drink and let the waves handle my stress levels. If anything crazy happens in the market, I’ll probably just laugh, shake my head, and dive back into the ocean. Enjoy the weekend, trade safe, and I’ll catch you all with a fresh perspective once I’m back and lobster-red from too much sun!
