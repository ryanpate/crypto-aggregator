Hey everyone, happy Friday! Crypto’s been doing its usual dance: Bitcoin’s been holding strong around \$102k after that overnight pop on news of another major bank announcing they’re dipping their toes into BTC custody services. Ethereum’s chilling in the \$2,600–\$2,650 range, but I’m keeping an eye on a possible breakout if Sunday’s staking rewards update comes through without hiccups. Meanwhile, XRP’s just hanging out near \$2.12, flirting with resistance—if that ETF chat heats up again, it could see a quick spike. Personally, I’m tossing a small buy into Litecoin (LTC) this afternoon since it’s been creeping back toward \$160 and feels like a low-key play if overall sentiment stays upbeat. Oh, and I snagged a few dollars’ worth of Dogecoin, mostly for old times’ sake and because Elon teased something cryptic about “meme power” in his morning tweet. Who knows, right?

On a totally unrelated note, I’m off next week for some much-needed R&R—think sun, sand, and zero price charts to watch. I’ll still peek at headlines if I can (FOMO is real), but the goal is to sip a cold drink and let the waves handle my stress levels. If anything crazy happens in the market, I’ll probably just laugh, shake my head, and dive back into the ocean. Enjoy the weekend, trade safe, and I’ll catch you all with a fresh perspective once I’m back and lobster-red from too much sun!
