Hey crew, it’s my last day soaking up sun on Bald Head Island, so here’s a slightly longer wrap-up before I pack up my beach chair. Over the weekend, the Israel-Iran airstrikes kicked off a wave of risk-off trading—Bitcoin dipped below \$103K before clawing back to around \$105K by this afternoon as oil and gold spiked ([Economic Times]((https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-sinks-below-103000-as-israel-iran-conflict-sparks-global-crypto-selloff/articleshow/121820959.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/dollar-other-safe-havens-rise-israel-strikes-iran-2025-06-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Ether and XRP weren’t immune either, down roughly 4% and 3.5% respectively at the worst of it. The big red flag? If Iran actually closes the Strait of Hormuz, we could see another cliff dive in crypto—as Cointelegraph warned, that chokepoint handles 20% of global oil, and any shutdown would torch risk assets overnight ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/closing-strait-hormuz-biggest-risk-btc-price-weekend?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

On the brighter side, Europe’s finally rolling out the red carpet: Gemini and Crypto.com just got MiCA licensing in Malta, with Luxembourg eyeing Coinbase next, marking a huge step toward harmonized rules across all 27 EU states ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/crypto-giants-set-eu-green-light-amid-growing-regulatory-rift-sources-say-2025-06-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Meanwhile, US-China trade talks are still stalled, keeping traders jittery about broader market liquidity ([Finance Magnates](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/why-is-crypto-going-down-today-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-and-xrp-prices-fall-after-cpi-read/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). As for my personal play? I doubled down on a small DOT position—between fresh staking rewards and nods from Polkadot’s developer summit, it feels like one to watch if risk appetite returns.

Alright, that’s a wrap from the beach—time to rinse off the sand and head home. I’ll be back at my desk Monday, hopefully with a tan and some fresh insights. Trade safe, stay chill, and let’s see what next week brings when reality (and malibu compression) kicks back in.
