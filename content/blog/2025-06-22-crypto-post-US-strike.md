## Crypto Market Shockwaves After US Attack on Iran

Hey everyone, Ryan here. Today the crypto world woke up to news of the US airstrike on Iran’s key military installations, and let me tell you—the charts are acting like they just saw a jump scare in a horror movie. In this post, we’ll dive into how **Bitcoin price plunged and recovered**, why **Ethereum volatility spiked**, the **stability of XRP amid Middle East conflict**, and which altcoins I’m eyeing as weekend buys.

### 1. Bitcoin Price Analysis After US Attack on Iran

When the news broke, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped from about \$108,500 down to \$104,200 within an hour—a 3.9% dip on massive sell volume. Risk-off sentiment hit hard as traders fled to safe-haven assets like gold and treasuries. By midday, dip-buyers swooped in, pushing BTC back toward \$106,800.  

**Long-form keyword:** crypto market reaction to US attack on Iran

My take: if BTC can hold above \$105,000 by today’s close, we may see consolidation around \$106K. But be ready for choppy swings—geopolitical headlines can ignite flash crashes in crypto faster than you can refresh.

---

### 2. Ethereum Volatility Due to Geopolitical Tensions

Ether (ETH) mirrored Bitcoin’s roller coaster, sliding from \$2,830 to \$2,650—a 6.3% drop—before recovering to \$2,710 on renewed DeFi optimism. High-leverage positions got liquidated, and gas fees briefly spiked as trading bots rebalanced portfolios.  

**Long-form keyword:** Ethereum volatility due to geopolitical tensions

Key level: \$2,700 is now critical support. If ETH falls below, expect another leg down toward \$2,600. Otherwise, any sign of easing Middle East tensions could spark a quick rebound.

### 3. XRP Stability Amid Middle East Conflict

XRP held up better, dipping only 2% from \$2.15 to \$2.10 before settling at \$2.13. Its lower correlation to BTC during conflict-driven sell-offs made it a relative “safe” altcoin. Ripple’s cross-border payment partnerships continue to underpin demand.  

**Long-form keyword:** XRP stability amid Middle East conflict

I’m watching \$2.10 closely—if it breaks, consider reducing exposure; if it holds, small add-ons around that level could pay off when volatility subsides.

### 4. Altcoin Investment Strategy for July 2025

Some altcoins have already shown resilience:

- **Chainlink (LINK):** Down 4% but trading near key support at \$32.50. A strong candidate for range trading.  
- **Polkadot (DOT):** Only 3% slide and major staking yield of 13% makes it attractive for income-seeking holders.  
- **Avalanche (AVAX):** Spiked network activity amid conflict news—AVAX could outperform if risk sentiment flips.  

**Long-form keyword:** altcoin investment strategy July 2025

My weekend watchlist: small positions in LINK and DOT, plus a speculative punt on AVAX if it dips under \$38.

### 5. Cryptocurrency Risk Management in War Scenarios

Conflict-driven volatility is part of the game. Here’s how I’m handling risk:

- Use tight stop-loss orders (BTC at \$104K, ETH at \$2,650).  
- Scale into positions on confirmed rebounds, not just headlines.  
- Keep cash reserves ready for sudden buying opportunities.

**Long-form keyword:** cryptocurrency risk management in war scenarios

## Looking Ahead

Markets often overreact to initial shock before finding equilibrium. Keep an eye on official statements, escalation risks in shipping lanes, and any diplomatic updates.  

I’ll be monitoring the charts over the weekend, sipping iced coffee and watching for any fresh catalysts. Trade safe, stay informed, and remember: in crypto, volatility is an opportunity if you’re prepared.
