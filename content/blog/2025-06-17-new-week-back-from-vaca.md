Hey gang, I’ve swapped my beach towel for a desk chair and—surprise—crypto’s still doing its roller-coaster thing. Here’s the quick and dirty on what’s moved since I got back:

Over the weekend, renewed Israel–Iran skirmishes sent Bitcoin tumbling about 0.7% to roughly \$106,120 before it bounced back toward \$107K  [oai_citation:0‡barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-price-ethereum-crypto-xrp-f5f5f9c9?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:1‡economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-steady-at-107k-amid-institutional-buying-altcoins-trade-mixed/articleshow/121904415.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Ethereum wasn’t spared either, sliding nearly 2.6% as traders fled to oil and gold for a safe haven  [oai_citation:2‡barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-price-ethereum-crypto-xrp-f5f5f9c9?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Even XRP wobbled around \$2.08 before steadier hands pushed it back to \$2.12—ETF chatter from Trump Media filing with the SEC might be the next spark to watch  [oai_citation:3‡reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/truth-social-bitcoin-ethereum-etf-files-with-us-sec-nyse-arca-listing-2025-06-16/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Midweek brought a surprise from Spain’s BBVA: they’re telling clients to park up to 7% of their portfolios in crypto (!), which felt like a strong endorsement—and gave Bitcoin’s floor a little boost  [oai_citation:4‡reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/spanish-bank-bbva-tells-wealthy-clients-invest-bitcoin-2025-06-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Meanwhile, institutional buyers kept BTC propped near \$107K on Wednesday, and altcoins like Solana and Polkadot slogged through mixed territory. Personally, I’ve got eyes on Polkadot’s ongoing developer summit buzz and will keep a small DOT stash for when the next rally hits.

**What I’ll be watching into the weekend:**  
- **Bitcoin:** Can it clear and hold \$108K amid geopolitical jitters?  
- **Ethereum:** Will DeFi TVL growth kick ETH toward \$2,700?  
- **XRP:** ETF or no ETF, will Ripple’s case developments give it wings?  
- **Polkadot:** Developer summit updates and staking yields.  

Real talk: crypto is the world’s wildest mash-up of finance, tech and headline drama. But hey, I’m back, caffeinated, and ready to ride the waves (just the digital kind now). Trade safe, stay curious, and may your weekend dips be buys—not tears!
