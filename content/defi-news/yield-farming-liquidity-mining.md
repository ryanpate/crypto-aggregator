## What Is Yield Farming?
Yield farming involves providing capital (usually stablecoins or ETH) into DeFi protocols, where your assets earn rewards—often additional tokens or a share of trading fees. Rewards are typically distributed in the protocol’s native governance token.

## How Liquidity Mining Works
Liquidity mining is a subset of yield farming where protocols incentivize users to supply assets into liquidity pools by distributing governance tokens. These tokens often grant voting rights and additional revenue shares.

### Key Mechanics:
- **Deposit Funds:** Supply token pairs (e.g., ETH/DAI) to an Automated Market Maker (AMM).
- **Earn Fees:** Collect a proportion of the trading fees generated by swaps.
- **Claim Tokens:** Receive governance tokens (SUSHI, UNI, CRV) as additional rewards.

## Popular Yield Farming Platforms
- **Uniswap & SushiSwap:** AMMs offering fee-based and token incentives.
- **Aave & Compound:** Lending markets with distribution of native tokens (AAVE, COMP).
- **Yearn.Finance:** Yield aggregator that auto-optimizes returns across pools.
- **Balancer:** Multi-asset pools with customizable weights and rewards.

## Risks and Considerations
- **Impermanent Loss:** Temporary loss relative to HODLing due to price divergence.
- **Smart Contract Risk:** Potential for hacks and exploits in unaudited code.
- **Token Volatility:** Reward tokens can suffer steep price drops post-distribution.
- **Gas Fees:** High Ethereum fees can eat into small yields.

## Strategies to Maximize Rewards
1. **Diversify Pools:** Spread capital across multiple protocols to mitigate risk.
2. **Use Stable Pools:** Employ stablecoin pools to reduce impermanent loss.
3. **Compound Rewards:** Reinvest earned tokens to boost compounding APY.
4. **Monitor APY:** Harvest rewards when yields spike and exit before declines.

## Tools & Yield Aggregators
- **Yearn.Finance:** Auto-compounds across DeFi for best returns.
- **Harvest Finance:** Community-driven yield farming vaults.
- **Zapper.fi & DeFi Saver:** Dashboards to track and manage farm positions.
