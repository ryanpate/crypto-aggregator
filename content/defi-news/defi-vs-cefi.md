# DeFi vs. CeFi: What's the Difference?

In the world of cryptocurrency and digital assets, two major paradigms coexist:

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Financial services built on blockchain networks without intermediaries.
- **Centralized Finance (CeFi):** Traditional or crypto-adjacent financial services operated by centralized entities (exchanges, banks).

This article explores the key distinctions, advantages, and drawbacks of each model.

## 1. Control & Custody

| Aspect                  | DeFi                                        | CeFi                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Custody**             | Users hold private keys and control funds    | Platform holds user funds            |
| **Access**             | Permissionless: anyone with a wallet        | KYC/AML required, geo-restricted     |

## 2. Transparency & Governance

- **DeFi:** Open-source smart contracts; governance via token votes (DAO).  
- **CeFi:** Closed-source platforms; decisions made by centralized management.

## 3. Services & Products

| Service               | DeFi Protocols                              | CeFi Platforms                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Exchanges**         | Uniswap, SushiSwap (AMM)                    | Coinbase, Binance                    |
| **Lending**           | Aave, Compound                              | BlockFi, Celsius                     |
| **Rewards**           | Liquidity mining, yield farming             | Staking, interest accounts           |

## 4. Security & Risk

- **Code Risk (DeFi):** Smart contract vulnerabilities; exploits can drain pools.  
- **Custodial Risk (CeFi):** Hackers targeting centralized servers; withdrawal freezes.

## 5. Yield & Fees

- **DeFi:** Variable gas fees; protocol fees shared with liquidity providers; complex APY.  
- **CeFi:** Platform-set interest rates; withdrawal/trading fees; fee structure transparent.

## 6. Speed & UX

- **DeFi:** Dependent on blockchain throughput; can be slow or expensive at peak.  
- **CeFi:** Instant fiat/crypto transactions; user-friendly interfaces.

## 7. Regulatory Environment

- **DeFi:** Largely unregulated; evolving legal landscape; potential compliance risks.  
- **CeFi:** Regulated entities abiding by banking and securities laws in various jurisdictions.
