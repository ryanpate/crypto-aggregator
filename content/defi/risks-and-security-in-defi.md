# Risks & Security in DeFi

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offers high rewards but comes with significant risks. This article covers the primary security considerations and how to protect your assets.

## 1. Smart Contract Risk
- **Vulnerabilities:** Bugs, logic flaws, reentrancy issues.
- **Audits:** Importance of third-party audits (e.g., CertiK, OpenZeppelin).
- **Formal Verification:** Advanced methods to mathematically prove correctness.

## 2. Impermanent Loss
- Occurs when asset price divergence causes LPs to lose relative to HODLing.
- **Mitigation:** Stablecoin pools, fee incentives, yield aggregators.

## 3. Oracle Manipulation
- **Flash Loan Attacks:** Borrow large amounts to manipulate on-chain price feeds.
- **Mitigation:** Decentralized oracle networks (Chainlink), TWAP price feeds.

## 4. Rug Pulls & Exit Scams
- **Malicious Liquidity Removal:** Developers drain pools of liquidity.
- **Preventive Measures:** Locked liquidity contracts, multisig governance.

## 5. Governance Attacks
- Malicious proposals by token whales to change protocol parameters.
- **Defense:** Vote delegation limits, timelocks on proposals.

## 6. Regulatory & Compliance Risk
- **Uncertainty:** Evolving KYC/AML requirements, stablecoin regulations.
- **Best Practices:** Use regulated on-ramps, monitor jurisdictional guidelines.

## 7. Private Key & Wallet Security
- **Hardware Wallets:** Cold storage best practice.
- **Social Recovery Wallets:** Argentâ€™s guardian approach.
- **Seed Phrase Management:** Offline, encrypted storage.

## 8. Network & Infrastructure Risks
- **High Gas Fees:** Can prevent timely transaction execution.
- **Chain Congestion:** Lead to failed txns or front-running.

## 9. Risk Management Strategies
1. **Diversification:** Spread capital across multiple protocols and asset types.
2. **Insurance Protocols:** Nexus Mutual, Cover Protocol for policy coverage.
3. **Regular Audits:** Monitor protocol health, community reports, exploits.
