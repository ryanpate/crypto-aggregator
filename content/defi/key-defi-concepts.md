# Key DeFi Concepts

Understanding Decentralized Finance starts with its core components and mechanics. Below are the fundamental concepts powering DeFi ecosystems:

## Smart Contracts
Self-executing code published on a blockchain (most commonly Ethereum) that automatically enforces the terms of an agreement without intermediaries. Examples:
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**–compatible contracts
- **Audits** and formal verification to ensure safety

## Liquidity Pools & Automated Market Makers (AMMs)
- **Liquidity Pools:** Pools of token pairs locked in smart contracts to enable permissionless trading and yield farming.
- **AMMs:** Algorithms (e.g., Uniswap’s Constant Product, Balancer’s multi-asset pools) that price assets based on pool reserves.

## Governance Tokens
Tokenized voting rights that allow holders to:
- Propose and vote on protocol upgrades
- Adjust parameters (fees, reward rates)
- Allocate treasury funds

## Oracles & Price Feeds
Trusted data bridges that feed off-chain information (e.g., asset prices) onto the blockchain:
- **Chainlink** – Decentralized oracle network
- **Band Protocol**, **API3**, **Tellor**

## Lending & Borrowing Protocols
Platforms that match lenders and borrowers without KYC:
- **Overcollateralization:** Users deposit crypto assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Examples:** Aave, Compound, MakerDAO (Dai stablecoin issuance)

## Yield Farming & Liquidity Mining
Mechanisms for earning additional tokens by supplying liquidity or staking in pools:
- **Yield aggregators** (e.g., Yearn.Finance) optimize strategies across protocols.
- **Fee-sharing** vs **token incentives** models.

## Stablecoins
Crypto assets pegged to stable reserves (USD, gold) for lower volatility:
- **Fiat-backed:** USDC, USDT
- **Crypto-collateralized:** DAI (MakerDAO)
- **Algorithmic:** Terra USD (historical example)

## Security & Risks
Key risks to understand:
- **Smart contract bugs & exploits**
- **Impermanent loss** when providing liquidity
- **Oracle manipulation**
- **Regulatory uncertainty**
