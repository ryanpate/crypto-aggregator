## What Is DeFi?
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to financial applications built on blockchain networks—most commonly Ethereum—that remove intermediaries like banks. DeFi enables peer-to-peer lending, trading, and yield generation through smart contracts.

*Learn more in our [What Is DeFi?](links/defi-basics.md) cluster article.*

## Key DeFi Concepts
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing code that enforces agreements.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Pooled funds that enable instant trading and yield.
- **Governance Tokens**: Tokens granting voting rights in protocol decisions.

*See our detailed primer on [DeFi Concepts](links/defi-concepts.md).*

## Top DeFi Protocols
1. **Uniswap** – A leading automated market maker (AMM).
2. **Aave** – Decentralized lending and borrowing.
3. **Compound** – Algorithmic money market protocol.

*Explore tutorials in our [Uniswap Tutorial](links/uniswap-tutorial.md) and [Aave Guide](links/aave-guide.md).*

## Yield Farming & Liquidity Mining
Yield farming involves staking or lending crypto in exchange for rewards. Liquidity mining incentivizes users to supply liquidity pools.

## Impermanent Loss Explained
Impermanent loss is the temporary loss of funds when you provide liquidity to an AMM. Discover how to minimize it.

*Read more: [Impermanent Loss in DeFi](links/impermanent-loss.md).*

## DeFi vs. CeFi
Compare Decentralized Finance with Centralized Finance to understand the benefits and trade-offs.

*Detailed analysis: [DeFi vs. CeFi](links/defi-vs-cefi.md).*

## Best DeFi Wallets
Secure your assets with top-rated wallets:
- MetaMask
- Trust Wallet
- Ledger Nano X

*Full list: [Best DeFi Wallets](links/best-defi-wallets.md).*

## Risks & Security
DeFi comes with smart contract risk, hacks, and regulatory uncertainty. Always research before you invest.

## Getting Started
1. Set up a wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
2. Acquire ETH or stablecoins on an exchange.
3. Explore an AMM like Uniswap or a lending protocol like Aave.
