      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-eyes-2-50-decision-zone-macro-wave-structure/",
      "summary": "XRP changed hands at roughly $2.30 in early European trading on Tuesday, extending a two-day bounce that has pulled the token back toward the upper half of the seven-month range that has confined it between about $2.00 and $2.80 since December. Analyst Quantum Ascend argues that this compression phase is now approaching a technical fulcrum that will determine whether the next move is an impulsive wave-three surge or one final wave-two washout. XRP Tightens Into Decision Zone In a video posted on 9 June, the trader noted that \u201cwe\u2019ve been in this range\u2026 since early December\u2026 between like $2.80 and $2.00 just bouncing the whole time,\u201d before zooming out to show what he calls the only Elliott-wave count that \u201cmakes sense\u201d: a completed five-wave advance from last year\u2019s lows followed by a five-wave corrective pull-back. \u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at a one-two-three-four-five on the way down\u2026 that\u2019s the macro two\u2026 and now we\u2019re waiting on three-four-five,\u201d he said, adding that XRP still represents about 12.5% of his portfolio despite his tactical rotation into \u201calts with more gas left.\u201d Quantum Ascend\u2019s Fibonacci mapping reveals that the token has already retraced slightly more than 50% of its preceding leg higher\u2014a textbook depth for a second-wave correction\u2014and that the sell-off bottomed in the price region that coincided with the fourth wave of the prior move. \u201cMakes sense, perfect spot for us to bounce,\u201d he told viewers after plotting the swing low against the 0.5 Fib level. Related Reading: XRP Bull Trap Incoming? Analyst Sees $2.40 Fakeout Before Painful Crash Whether that bounce blossoms into a sustained breakout, he stressed, ultimately hinges on the market leader: \u201cI think Bitcoin\u2019s gonna make the decision for us,\u201d he said, pointing out that XRP\u2019s fate remains tightly coupled to any directional conviction in BTC. Bitcoin\u2019s own advance toward key retracement resistance could, in his view, drag major altcoins\u2014including XRP\u2014into their respective inflection zones. The analyst now fixes on the 0.618\u20130.786 Fib band, which corresponds to $2.42\u2013$2.52, as the \u201cdecision zone.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be an area that we gotta be careful of\u2026 statistically it\u2019s the area we\u2019re most probable to roll over\u2026 between $2.42 and $2.52,\u201d he warned, outlining the risk that XRP forms an A-B-C zig-zag and revisits lower supports before the larger impulsive leg begins. A rejection there would map onto the classical script of a complex second wave that fakes out early longs one final time before relinquishing control to bulls. Related Reading: XRP Price Remains Bullish Above $2, This Falling Channel Says $3.8 Is Coming Macro currents may soon add fuel. XRP\u2019s next potential volatility catalyst is the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s 17 June deadline on Franklin Templeton\u2019s spot-XRP exchange-traded fund proposal\u2014a ruling some desks see as the token\u2019s analogue to January\u2019s Bitcoin ETF moment. While ETF speculation has helped price reclaim higher ground this month, XRP remains almost a dollar below its January all-time high of $3.40, leaving the $2.42\u2013$2.52 pocket as the most technically significant hurdle in the short term. For now, traders will watch whether the current advance can print a daily close inside\u2014or better, above\u2014that corridor. A clean break would validate Quantum Ascend\u2019s wave-three thesis and open the charts to measured moves targeting the mid-$3s. Failure, by contrast, risks a final capitulation toward the lower-$2 region before the larger bull structure can re-assert itself. Whatever the outcome, the analyst remains sanguine: \u201cWhether it rolls over here one more time and we have to be patient or it just goes\u2014that\u2019s okay, because either way the end result is going to be the same.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.28.

      "summary": "BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has made headlines by amassing a staggering $70 billion in total assets, achieving this milestone faster than any other exchange-traded fund (ETF) in history. This remarkable feat occurred just 341 days after its launch, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that IBIT reached this figure five times quicker than the previous record holder, State Street\u2019s GLD gold ETF, which took nearly 1,700 days. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT Outshines Competitors As the most popular of the twelve Bitcoin ETFs currently available, IBIT stands out significantly in the market. Following closely behind are Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, both of which have around $20 billion in assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The \u2018Next Impulse\u2019, Analyst Predicts The launch of IBIT and ten other Bitcoin ETFs at the start of last year by the world\u2019s largest asset managers marked a significant shift in the investment landscape, fueled by long-awaited regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The debut of these funds highlighted a robust demand from investors eager to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations. IBIT alone accumulated over $1 billion in assets within just four days of its market introduction. By November, IBIT had surpassed the total assets of BlackRock\u2019s gold fund, solidifying its position as the largest among the 1,400 funds managed by the asset manager worldwide. Bitcoin ETF Market Thrives The momentum didn\u2019t stop there; in December, IBIT became the fastest exchange-traded fund to hit $50 billion in assets, achieving this milestone five times quicker than BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, which took nearly four years to reach the same level. \u201cIBIT\u2019s growth is unprecedented,\u201d remarked Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart in an interview with Fortune Magazine on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, outpacing any other ETF across all asset classes.\u201d Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric The surge in Bitcoin ETFs has coincided with significant increases in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. For instance, as Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $111,900 in late May, the cumulative net assets across all twelve Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $134 billion, reflecting the growing interest and investment in this digital asset class. Since reaching its record high, the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has retraced, with the most important support line at $100,000 being tested on June 5. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has once again regained its bullish momentum, jumping past the $108,400 mark on Monday. With gains of 2% and 4% on the 24-hour and weekly time frames, respectively, the price of BTC is now only 2.7% below the record price level. This puts the cryptocurrency on the verge of a new price discovery phase after the normal pullback seen last week. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-70-170-jump/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price is still holding above $100,000 despite suffering a crash right before the weekend. It has since bounced back from the $104,000 level, suggesting that bulls are making their stand at this major psychological level. Now, with the crypto market sitting at what looks to be a critical point, questions are arising about what the next step could be from here. Can Bitcoin still rally, or is this the end of a rather short and underwhelming bull market? Bitcoin Price Still Has A Long Way To Go Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has been a vocal voice when it comes to the bullishness of the Bitcoin price. He has continued to call for higher prices even at a time when the wider community is expecting the cryptocurrency to keep falling from here. In fact, the crypto analyst believes that the leading crypto could see its price double from here, despite already hitting multiple new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Head &#38; Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control? In a post on X, Doctor Profit explained the reasoning behind this and why he believes that the Bitcoin price still has room to run. The first thing he pointed to was the fact that a rare Golden Cross had appeared on the Bitcoin price chart. This happened three weeks ago, and back then, the analyst called out the chart formation, explaining that this meant that the bull run was not over. This is because every time Bitcoin had flashed a Golden Cross in the past, it had been the start of another massive run. Just like now, it is first followed by a 10% decline in price, which was achieved when Bitcoin fell from $111,900 to $100,000. Now that the first part of the trend seems to have been fulfilled, expectations are that the other parts will play out similarly. In addition to this, he explains that Bitcoin has also formed its diagonal resistance, which it is now looking to break out from. A successful break would put it back above $108,000 as it gears up for the next leg-up. Macro Factors That Support The Thesis Not only does the chart technicals show this possible recovery, but the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, expected to be released on Wednesday, plays into this as well. Doctor Profit explains that Wall Street is already expecting the CPI to come in at 2.5%, a rather high number. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June\u2013July Rally After 5-Month Pullback Instead, he believes that the CPI will come in lower, putting it between 2.1% and 2.3%. A lower figure would mean that there is a slowdown in inflation, allowing room for more risk-taking and pushing markets such as stocks and crypto higher. Also, there is the matter of the negative funding rate, which suggests that there are more shorters in the market right now, expecting the price to tank. Data from Coinglass shows the Bitcoin funding rate has dropped to one of the lowest levels this year, and the analyst says this is a sign of a healthy market. \u201cOverall, I see a strong trend and markets will continue to rise with first targets between 108-110k, and this is by far not the end,\u201d Doctor Profit said. \u201cThe golden cross is promising us between 70-170% in gains in the coming months!\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "The market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable spike on Monday, surging past the $108,000 mark after a period of consolidation between $100,000 and $106,000 for the past week. This surge comes as key officials from the United States and China prepare for critical trade negotiations in London, aimed at addressing ongoing tensions and salvaging \u201ca fragile trade agreement.\u201d US-China Trade Talks Spark Investor Optimism The cryptocurrency gained 2% on Monday, briefly touching a peak of $108,900 before settling back slightly. This uptick reflects growing investor optimism regarding the potential resolution of trade disputes between the US and China, one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China\u2019s Vice Premier for Economic Policy, He Lifeng, are set to lead their respective delegations in discussions that began Monday and are expected to continue into Tuesday, as reported by Fortune. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric These negotiations are part of President Donald Trump\u2019s broader strategy to compel US trading partners to meet various demands, often through the threat of imposing significant tariffs on imports. Following the announcement of a sweeping tariff policy in April, which impacted nearly all American trading partners, Trump authorized a 90-day pause for negotiations. However, this pause did not apply to tariffs on China, which were escalated to 145%. Trade Talks Resuming As Bitcoin Prices Rise The heightened tensions between the two nations had previously led to a significant drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value, reaching a yearly low of $75,000 as fears of a trade war drove investors away from American markets. However, optimism returned following a summit in Geneva last month, where Trump announced a temporary agreement that would lower tariffs and facilitate further discussions. In the wake of this news, Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. Yet, the truce was short-lived. Trump claimed that China had violated the agreement over a dispute regarding exports of rare earth magnets. On May 30, he expressed his frustrations on Truth Social, stating, \u201cChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d In an urgent attempt to salvage the deteriorating trade deal, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call last week, their first in months. Following this 90-minute conversation, it was announced that senior officials from both countries would meet in London this week to resume negotiations. In addition to trade-related factors, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price surge may also be influenced by increased activity in the cryptocurrency initial public offering (IPO) market. Wave Of Crypto IPO Activity Last week, the stablecoin giant Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shares soaring by over 168%, jumping from an initial price of $31 to $69 on the first day of trading. Additionally, Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed for an initial public offering, further demonstrating the crypto industry&#8217;s growing connection to traditional finance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The \u2018Next Impulse\u2019, Analyst Predicts \u201cWhile the IPO excitement may be short-lived, the long-term positioning of institutional investors suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin\u2019s performance through 2025,\u201d remarked David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets, in an interview with Fortune. When writing, BTC trades at $108,670, recording gains of 6% in the monthly time frame, little over 2.7% from its record high of $111,8000 reached in May.
