      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-blasts-to-ath/",
      "summary": "After hovering below the $110K mark over the past few weeks, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high yesterday. Bolstered by growing institutional adoption, $BTC is stronger than ever. And that means now\u2019s the time to buy crypto before the next surge. $BTC finally reached the $100K milestone late last year, before outdoing itself in May, when it reached $111,970. Making it to $112,017 is another first for the crypto OG. Make no mistake, Lady Luck played no hand in Bitcoin\u2019s surge. It\u2019s down to an ever-growing list of financial institutions worldwide that are recognizing the value of $BTC, due in part to supportive government policies. Top Guns Weigh In Bitcoin champion Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, argues that Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period. In fact, he told Bloomberg in a June 10 interview that he believes that $BTC will be $1M. \u201cThe President of the United States supports Bitcoin. The Cabinet supports Bitcoin. [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin. Paul Atkins has shown himself to be enthusiastic about bitcoin and digital assets. Brian Quintenz at CFTC feels that the banks will custody Bitcoin.\u201d Saylor explained that Bitcoin Treasury companies are buying $BTC\u2019s natural supply. In addition, \u201cBlackRock and the ETFs are buying another measure of that, and we&#8217;ve got nation-state actors coming into the space. The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin is moving higher.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s status as a heavyweight institutional asset is solidifying fast. And while Saylor\u2019s Strategy continues to grab the spotlight, the corporate herd is growing. Take GameStop, for instance. It made waves in May by greenlighting Bitcoin buys at the board level. Soon after, GameStop purchased 4.71K Bitcoin. And for its part, the Trump Media and Technology Group is also eyeing a blended crypto ETF. Dubbed the \u201cCrypto Blue Chip ETF,\u201d it plans to offer exposure to five digital assets. Some 70% of the ETF&#8217;s holdings will be in $BTC, 15% in $ETH, 8% in $SOL, and 5% in $XRP. The remaining 2% of the ETF\u2019s holdings will be in $CRO \u2013 the native token of the ETF\u2019s digital custodian, the exchange Crypto.com. Bitcoin Wins, Crypto Scores With fresh ETF inflows, increased corporate balance sheet exposure, the rise of crypto futures, and a more favorable regulatory environment, $BTC is experiencing a powerful surge in institutional interest. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, if you&#8217;re wondering which crypto to buy before the next big surge, you&#8217;re in the right place. Here are three altcoins with massive potential to explode when $BTC rallies again. If Michael Saylor\u2019s predictions hold true, that surge could be just around the corner. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Scalability for Bitcoin Through an L2 In keeping with all things $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings an exciting proposal to the crypto table. A Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) platform. The Bitcoin blockchain has a lot going for it, especially in terms of top-level security. It falls short, however, in terms of speed and high transaction fees, especially when compared to the likes of Solana. In short, Bitcoin lacks scalability. That\u2019s where $HYPER steps up to the plate. This upcoming meme coin is set to power an innovative Bitcoin L2 ecosystem that will increase the speed and reduce fees. More importantly, it adds cross-chain compatibility. That means seamless access to the best meme coins, DeFi, and dApps. At the moment, Bitcoin Hyper is on presale. That means you can buy it for $0.0122. You can also stake your $HYPER for 360% APY. If you\u2019re keen to discover more about this L2 and the meme coin behind it, take a look at our guide to buying $HYPER. It explains all you need to know. Keep in mind, though, that as a presale, the price of $HYPER will increase in stages, offering you the chance to secure tokens at a lower cost now. Additionally, the rewards APY is dynamic and will decrease over time, so the earlier you get in, the better the returns. Once $HYPER lists on DEXs after the presale, the price is expected to rise even further, so now is a prime opportunity to get involved before the price climbs. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 Driving Global Crypto Wallet Market Domination It\u2019s not only institutions that are taking Bitcoin and other digital assets much more seriously these days. With the growing number of retail, as in individual, investors also entering the scene, it means a bigger demand for crypto wallets. That\u2019s what makes the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) one to watch with a very close eye. It\u2019s the native token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial, no KYC, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet that is gaining serious market traction. So much so that Best Wallet is on a mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. And it\u2019s using $BEST to help it achieve that target. Holding $BEST means additional benefits and features of what is already a leading crypto wallet. That includes being able to buy the best presale crypto directly from the mobile wallet (a market first, by the way); lower transaction fees; and higher staking rewards. $BEST also comes with community governance. So you can have a say in the project\u2019s direction \u2013 including the presale tokens available to buy, and other features. $BEST is also on presale. Buy yours today for $0.025305 and stake it for 99% before the upcoming price increase. Our How To Buy $BEST guide explains how to do just that. 3. America Party ($AP) \u2013 On the Heels Of Musk&#8217;s New Party The America Party Token ($AP) is another newcomer to the crypto scene. It was launched mere days after Elon Musk announced he intends to create a new political party. However, unlike $HYPER and $BEST, which are both on presale, $AP is already listed on DEXs. To be clear, though, the $AP token is not affiliated with Musk or the America Party he is launching. That said, $AP does stand to ride on Musk\u2019s coattails. And to sweeten the deal, when Musk mentions a cryptocurrency, meme coins in particular, that token often explodes. And recently, Musk was asked by a follower whether his America Party will embrace Bitcoin. His response was definitive: \u201cFiat is useless, so yes.\u201d Another boost for crypto. Right now, $AP costs $0.01830 \u2013 up 239.38% since it launched on July 7. Get yours today through UniSwap or MEXC. \u201cThe Writing\u2019s On The Wall\u201d As Saylor put it, \u201cBitcoin is moving higher.\u201d And while the market can be unpredictable at best, $BTC\u2019s latest rally to $112K is a definitive indicator that the institutional adoption of digital assets is positively impacting, and with signs of slowing. That means newer cryptos like $HYPER, $BEST, and $AP also have the potential to pump if current conditions continue. And the best part of investing in new tokens is getting in at an early-bird price. That said, nothing is guaranteed, and we\u2019re not financial advisers. Be sure to always DYOR research before making any investment."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-one-candle-away-141300-breakout/",
      "summary": "Top analyst Aksel Kibar (CMT) believes Bitcoin is approaching a decisive moment on the weekly chart. In a post shared on 9 July 2025, the veteran technician noted that BTC/USD is \u201cholding right at the pattern boundary.\u201d The annotated chart he released\u2014covering Bitstamp weekly prices back to mid-2022\u2014shows the cryptocurrency compressing directly beneath a horizontal resistance band at $109,000, the neckline of what he labels a six-month head-and-shoulders (H&#38;S) continuation formation. Bitcoin Poised For $141,300 Kibar\u2019s chart first revisits the basing sequence that reversed the 2022 bear cycle. A textbook inverse head-and-shoulders bottom completed in early-2023, with troughs at roughly $17,600 (left shoulder), $15,500 (head) and $19,500 (right shoulder). The breakout above the neckline sent Bitcoin to $31,400. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? Immediately thereafter, price stalled in a six-month rectangle bounded by $25,000 support and $31,400 resistance. The eventual topside resolution propelled the market to the rectangle\u2019s implied target of $38,000, validating two consecutive classical projections in less than a year. Afterwards, the BTC price grinded higher. Below $73,700, BTC consolidated in a falling wedge, ending with a breakout toward $109,000. From that point, the initial pullback bottomed at $91,200, creating what Kibar designates as the left shoulder. A deeper descent to $76,500 carved out the head. Then, the Bitcoin price formed the right shoulder at $101,500, echoed by the blue bowl-shaped arc on the chart. Throughout this structure the neckline at $109,000 remained intact, acting as a clear demarcation between consolidation and fresh highs. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern spans roughly half a year, matching the analyst\u2019s \u201c6-month-long\u201d annotation. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000\u2014Is History Repeating? Using the orthodox H&#38;S continuation rule\u2014adding the vertical distance from the head ($73,700) to the neckline ($109,000) to the breakout level\u2014Kibar derives a price objective of $141,300. He notes in an X reply that this target is separate from the earlier $137,000 objective, which came from a larger cup-with-handle on the monthly scale. In other words, the shorter-term weekly pattern now projects modestly higher than the longer-term structure. At press time Bitcoin, Bitcoin traded near $111,000, surpassing the neckline. However, from a technician\u2019s standpoint, the breakout still needs to confirm with the weekly close. Confirmation requires a decisive weekly settlement north of the $109,000 neckline. As Kibar notes: \u201cBreakout needs to take place with a long white candle, similar to previous pattern completions. There should be no hesitation.\u201d Invalidation would emerge on a weekly close back below the most recent swing-low support at $101,500; deeper failure beneath $91,2000 would unravel the pattern entirely. For now, Bitcoin sits at the fulcrum of its six-month equilibrium. A weekly candle or two should reveal whether the largest digital asset can convert yet another classical chart formation into a measured move\u2014this time toward mid-six-figure territory.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-back-at-range-highs-breakout-above-2800-could-ignite-altseason/",
      "summary": "Ethereum surged over 5% yesterday, pushing past the key $2,700 level and signaling renewed strength across the altcoin market. After weeks of sideways action and uncertainty, this move marks a small but significant breakout, reigniting bullish sentiment among investors and traders. The breakout comes as Bitcoin continues to consolidate below its all-time highs, allowing ETH and other altcoins to take the lead. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape Market participants are closely watching Ethereum\u2019s price action, as its movements often set the tone for the broader altcoin space. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical view highlighting that ETH is once again trading at the top of its recent range. A breakout above this level could confirm the beginning of a larger expansion phase for altcoins. With bullish momentum building and Ethereum holding strong above reclaimed support levels, traders are becoming increasingly confident that the altcoin market may be on the verge of a broader breakout. However, key resistance still lies ahead, and the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum has the strength to continue higher and lead a new leg up in the crypto cycle. Ethereum Trades at Range Highs: Breakout Looms Ethereum has spent the past several weeks consolidating in a well-defined range between approximately $2,400 and $2,800, a structure that began forming in early May. Despite short-term volatility, ETH has held key support levels, suggesting that bulls remain in control. Now, with price action pushing toward the upper boundary of the range once again, the market is watching closely to see whether Ethereum can break through resistance and initiate a sustained rally. The broader macroeconomic backdrop has shifted in favor of risk assets. In the US, strong labor market data and wage growth have helped ease concerns of an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, the resolution of several global geopolitical tensions has reduced uncertainty, allowing markets to stabilize. This supportive environment could give Ethereum the fuel it needs to attempt a breakout. Ted Pillows recently highlighted that Ethereum is now trading at the range highs again \u2014 a level that has repeatedly capped price advances in recent months. According to Pillow, a confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance would likely trigger renewed momentum for ETH and potentially spark a broader move across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves $2,800 Resistance Now In Sight Ethereum is showing renewed strength as it breaks out of a multi-week consolidation range, with the latest 12-hour candle closing above $2,760. The price action has decisively reclaimed the $2,700 level and is now testing the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This breakout is supported by a clear surge in volume, confirming bullish momentum. The 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages are all trending upwards and currently sit well below the current price, a strong technical sign of sustained momentum. ETH has moved above all three key SMAs, confirming that bulls are in control in the short to medium term. Notably, this is the highest ETH has traded since early June, and the candle structure resembles a classic continuation breakout setup. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise A successful daily close above $2,800 would open the door for an expansion toward the $3,000 level and potentially higher if momentum holds. However, the key now lies in whether buyers can sustain this move without immediate rejection at resistance. If ETH can hold above $2,700 and build support, the breakout could serve as a launchpad for altcoins, especially as Ethereum often leads broader market moves.

      "title": "\u2018Real\u2019 Crypto Bull Run Just Beginning, Says Analyst\u2014Here\u2019s Why",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/real-crypto-bull-run-just-beginning-analyst/",
      "summary": "In a livestream broadcast on X, independent market technician Kevin, known online as @Kev_Capital_TA, argued that crypto markets are only now entering what he called \u201cthe real bull run,\u201d pointing to a confluence of technical signals, macroeconomic data and inter-market correlations that he believes have not been fully appreciated by traders. The Real Bull Run Starts Here Kevin placed particular emphasis on the behavior of Tether dominance (USDT.D), the share of crypto market capitalization held in the dollar-pegged stablecoin. The analyst displayed two long-term logarithmic USDT.D charts, each showing an initial sharp decline followed by what he described as a \u201crising channel slash bear flag.\u201d In both 2024 and the present structure, the measured-move target of the pattern sits at 3.70 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s really astonishing how this is kind of attempting to play out,\u201d he said, stressing that any sustainable rally in risk assets will require that level to be reached. \u201cThe two key words that are going to be the most important words over the next couple of weeks are follow through.\u201d Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds \u2013 Details He then overlaid a macro descending triangle on a separate two-week USDT.D chart dating back to March 2020. Each time the two-week Stochastic RSI crossed downward, the dominance metric fell sharply, coinciding with periods of strength in Bitcoin and altcoins. The latest cross, now curling lower, again targets 3.70 percent. If that support were to give way, Kevin allowed, a deeper slide toward \u201cthe two-percent handle\u201d could mark a \u201cpeak bull market\u201d phase\u2014though he cautioned against speculating that far ahead. The technical discussion broadened to Bitcoin\u2019s hash-ribbon indicator, which tracks miner capitulation and recovery. Historically, weekly \u201cbuy\u201d signals have preceded 40 to 100 percent upside moves within nine weeks, with what Kevin called a \u201c100 percent hit rate\u201d over eight years of back-testing. Kevin linked the on-chain data to macro conditions. Citing the real-time inflation gauge \u201cTruthflation,\u201d he highlighted a 1.66 percent reading\u2014below the Federal Reserve\u2019s nominal 2 percent target\u2014and falling import prices, both of which, he argued, increase the odds of an imminent shift to easier policy. \u201cIf Truthflation stays below 2 percent, you\u2019re going to get the easing you want,\u201d he said, predicting that markets would price in an end to quantitative tightening ahead of any official announcement. \u201cRetail traders are becoming more educated than they\u2019ve ever been.\u2026 The market will sniff out rate cuts coming.\u201d Altcoin capital rotation formed a second pillar of the bullish thesis. Ethereum\u2019s market-share chart, he said, had been basing at 2019-2020 lows, with monthly MACD, Stochastic RSI and Market Cipher signals all turning up. Early reallocations into ETH-beta names such as Chainlink and Uniswap are already \u201cup 60 percent\u201d from their accumulation zones, he claimed, framing the moves as the foothills of a broader run. Nonetheless, he warned viewers not to wait for central-bank confirmation: \u201cDon\u2019t be the person sitting on the sidelines waiting for Powell to come out saying QT is over.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Turning to Bitcoin itself, Kevin acknowledged that the benchmark still faces substantial resistance. Price must clear the March record, then the $112,000\u2013$116,000 range and, ultimately, $120,000 before \u201cthin air\u201d opens a path to $140,000\u2013$150,000.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-inverse-head-shoulders/",
      "summary": "XRP has been one of the most-watched altcoins recently, with multiple developments emerging for its parent company, Ripple. However, while Ripple has seen a lot of positives, XRP has continued to struggle when it comes to price. Amid the selling, bulls have put up an impressive fight to hold the support above $2.2 for the time being. This has led to the formation of a new inverse head and shoulders pattern that could signal a reversal is coming. Analyst Highlights Bullish Formation For XRP Price Crypto analyst TheSignalyst, in a new analysis, showed that the XRP price has begun another bullish formation. This time around, it is the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern that often precedes a surge for an asset. Not only has this formation come at a critical junction, it happened while bulls have maintained strong support levels. Related Reading: Altcoins Reclaim Trendline That Led To 2021 Explosion, Will History Repeat Itself? Through the market downtrend, the XRP price has been able to hold above $1.75 and $2, which the analyst points out as a major level. The return to this support level has brought a fresh wave of bullishness, and the XRP price could be ready for another uptrend from here. Presently, all eyes are on this support level, and TheSignalyst revealed that if XRP is able to hold this level, then the rally could be in motion. They point to the green neckline, which is shown in the chart as sitting just above $2.3, and this is the resistance that needs to be broken for the price to rally in the short term. For the long term, the analyst suggests that a clean break above the $2.66 level is needed. This is what would provide confirmation for a bullish continuation. If the setup holds, then the analyst puts the top of formation as high as $3.3 in the long term. Analysts Predict Higher Prices The calls for higher prices for XRP have grown louder, especially as investors have begun to make their bets once again. Analyst Crypto Virtuos pointed out that the XRP trading volume saw a notable uptick of 125% in a 24-hour period as interest ballooned once again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs? Analyst Explains The 2 Options Amid this rise in momentum, the crypto analyst, just like TheSignalyst, also explained that $2.3 is the hurdle that is holding the XRP price back now. Therefore, the cryptocurrency does need to overtake this level if it is to see a continuation of the uptrend. At the time of writing, the XRP price is still trending below $2.3, with sellers showing signs of exhaustion. Once the selling stops, then the bulls could trigger another upward wave to retest the resistance at $2.3 once again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"
