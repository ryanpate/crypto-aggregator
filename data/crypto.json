      "summary": "Bitcoin has resumed a slow climb upward after a recent period of consolidation, briefly breaking back above the $106,000 mark earlier today. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $105,383, reflecting a 0.8% increase over the past 24 hours. While this upward move has not sparked a major breakout, analysts are paying close attention to on-chain and market structure indicators that suggest a cautiously balanced environment. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Breakdown\u2014\u2019If This Continues, It Snaps\u2019 On-Chain Data Points to Equilibrium, But Demand Wanes According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the market currently lacks extreme signals of profit-taking or panic. In a recent analysis, Darkfost explained that realized profits over a seven-day moving average remain below $1 billion. This is in line with figures observed during the market correction in late 2024 and significantly below peaks seen in early 2025. The analyst suggests that the current realized profit levels point to a market that is not under pressure from large-scale investor exits, supporting the ongoing consolidation. In the same report, Darkfost also discussed how a decline in demand may be limiting further upward momentum. By analyzing the ratio of new supply to the supply held inactive for over a year, the study observed that while demand remains positive, it has been weakening since Bitcoin\u2019s local high in May. This suggests that although the market is absorbing existing selling pressure, fresh buying interest is not strong enough to trigger a new rally. As a result, the market appears to be in a state of temporary equilibrium, a phase where both sellers and buyers are relatively inactive. Bitcoin Traders Brace for Volatility in a Crowded Range Another CryptoQuant analyst, BorisVest, echoed the sentiment of a tightly contested market by analyzing Binance order flow and position data. He noted that Bitcoin has traded within a range of $100,000 to $110,000 for nearly a month. Within this band, both long and short positions have been building, and traders are watching the extremes of this zone closely. According to BorisVest, any breakout beyond $110,000 or drop below $100,000 could set the tone for the next significant price movement. The $100K\u2013$110K price range has become a battleground for both bulls and bears. BorisVest observed that short positions are currently increasing, indicating that a significant portion of market participants expect a downward correction. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout? On-Chain Signals Say \u2018Watch This Level\u2019 However, he also pointed out that when shorts dominate, the risk of a sudden reversal, known as a short squeeze, becomes more likely.

      "summary": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound &#8211; trading between $100,000 and $110,000 for about a month &#8211; both short and long positions have been building within this range, with short positions rising at a faster pace. Bitcoin Long Positions Slightly Ahead But Shorts Catching Up After reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 last month, BTC has consolidated within the $100,000\u2013$110,000 range for nearly a month, offering little clarity on its next directional move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions \u2013 Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack According to a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, fresh data from Binance crypto exchange suggests that long positions currently hold a slight edge in this range. Historical data reveals a pattern &#8211; when short positions rise, short squeezes tend to follow. Similarly, a buildup in long positions has often led to long squeezes. A decisive breakout from either end of the current range will likely determine Bitcoin\u2019s next major move. That said, Binance data indicates that while long positions are marginally ahead, the ratio of longs to shorts remains relatively balanced. The funding rate hovering near neutral levels supports this view, reflecting a closely contested standoff between bulls and bears. However, such balance usually signals uncertainty in the market. While long interest has stabilized, short positions continue to climb &#8211; likely driven by expectations of further downside amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. BorisVest noted: This shows that most market participants believe the rally may not continue. When Bitcoin&#8217;s price starts to fall, and funding rates turn negative, it means shorts are piling in quickly. All of this points to this range being a highly sensitive zone. He further noted that with most traders leaning toward short positions, the setup could be ripe for a surprise move in the opposite direction &#8211; possibly fuelled by quiet accumulation from larger market participants. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? Despite BTC trading within the $100,000 &#8211; $110,000 range for the better part of the previous month, several analysts posit that the flagship cryptocurrency is preparing for a major move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low \u2013 No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Most analysts are leaning toward a move to the upside. For instance, crypto trader Josh Olszewics remarked that if liquidity holds, then BTC may eye a move toward the $150,000 level. From a technical standpoint, the outlook is encouraging. Crypto analyst Mister Crypto recently pointed out that BTC is forming a bullish inverse head &#38; shoulders pattern on the 3-day chart. However, latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross recently moved into an overpriced zone, warranting caution.

Prices have carved lower highs and higher lows as trendlines converge. Data from crypto analyst Ali shows, this narrowing range often precedes a major move. He notes the tip of the triangle is due by June 2025, which puts a deadline on when volatility should pick up. DOGE Bulls Eye Breakout According to Ali\u2019s analysis, a daily close above $0.22 likely signals a bullish breakout. If that happens, he sees Dogecoin reaching roughly $0.35 or $0.36\u2014about 60% higher than current levels. On the flip side, a drop below $0.16 could spark a sell\u2011off toward $0.10. Investors are watching those exact levels to decide whether to join buyers or cut losses. DOGE Price Forecast Digital Coin Price is on the optimistic end. They predict Dogecoin could go past $0.37 before year\u2011end and even test its old high of $0.74 again. Market Catalysts Could Tip The Scales Dogecoin\u2019s swings often mirror the wider crypto space or follow social media buzz. A surge in Bitcoin or Ethereum prices could carry DOGE higher, while a broader sell\u2011off would magnify losses. Some traders also keep an eye on endorsements from well\u2011known figures and major exchange listings.

      "summary": "CryptoInsightUK\u2019s latest market briefing arrives with the sound of literal hammer blows next door, an accidental soundtrack to the pounding he expects traders to take before the next rally. In a thirteen\u2013minute walkthrough of XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity maps, the British analyst argues that the market is staging what he calls \u201ca deliberate trap\u201d designed to flush out weak hands, harvest stop-loss orders and maximise upside leverage for larger players\u2014leaving retail participants \u201cscreaming, \u2018Yay, we\u2019re going to the upside,\u2019 \u2026 only to find out they\u2019ve been played.\u201d The Trap Is Set, Warns XRP Trader He begins with XRP\u2019s five-month down-channel that started at the New-Year peak, noting that price continues to hug the underside of a descending trend line. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck below that trend line basically looking to see if this liquidity is going to get taken below us. My obvious opinion is that it is,\u201d he says, underscoring the conviction that a sweep of resting bids below remains the path of least resistance. The flush, he contends, would \u201cmake our journey to the upside much better and much easier to navigate,\u201d because it would reset funding, scare out late longs and reload the order book for what he still calls the next \u201cparabolic expansion probably up towards the $8 to $12 region.\u201d Related Reading: \u2018Out of Time\u2019: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts The trap, however, may not be a straightforward vertical collapse. Charts, he reminds viewers, \u201clove doing something like\u201d an initial breakout that rallies 15-20%, convinces traders the bear-phase is finished, and then abruptly reverses into the deep liquidity pocket below. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how higher-highs-and-higher-lows type situations are supposed to get you frustrated,\u201d he says, openly conceding that the pattern looks engineered. The phrase he never uses\u2014manipulation\u2014hovers unspoken over the analysis, but his rhetoric leaves little doubt: \u201cThis is how they test everybody.\u201d Bitcoin, in his narrative, may serve as the decoy that sets the trap. The benchmark asset has already slipped out of its own wedge-like consolidation and, he observes, \u201cdoes like to do this sort of thing\u201d by staging premature upside breaks. He sketches a possible march toward $115,000 that would \u201cdelay the inevitable\u201d and then give way to a liquidity hunt of its own. Even so, his mid-cycle price band for Bitcoin remains $150,000 to $220,000. That upside, he argues, justifies dollar-cost-averaging into altcoins even while keeping \u201ca tiny bit of dry powder\u201d in reserve for the washout he expects. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 A more elaborate scenario involves a temporary dominance surge in Bitcoin to the 66 to 74% range. As Bitcoin siphons capital, alts such as XRP would \u201cbleed out,\u201d take the downside liquidity target, and only then reverse as cash rotates back into their order books. He illustrates the dance on twin TradingView panels\u2014Bitcoin on the left, XRP on the right\u2014before concluding that the rotational setup is \u201cnot highly likely\u201d because it requires several macro-scale dominoes to fall in sequence. Still, he refuses to dismiss it, pointing to the strategic reserve bill in Washington as the sort of narrative catalyst that could spark a temporary Bitcoin-only rally and demoralise alt-holders. Macro-risk flickers through the commentary\u2014wars that could \u201cshove us down\u201d in the near term\u2014but he treats geopolitical stress as a catalyst for final capitulation rather than a thesis-killer. \u201cThe upside is so large it almost can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d he insists, framing the present chop as a high-volatility pause before a structural up-leg. Whether that leg begins only after a full flush or emerges from yet another fake-out remains uncertain, but the analyst\u2019s message is unmistakable: traders who chase breakouts without accounting for hidden hands risk being liquidated first, spectators to the parabola they hoped to ride. For now he is content to wait \u201cfor the market to do its worst trick,\u201d believing that the final shakeout will announce itself through a sudden, depth-piercing wick. \u201cYou\u2019re being played,\u201d he warns. The admonition is stark: if the playbook unfolds as expected, the pain will be quick. \u201cIf we get these levels, that\u2019s where I\u2019m putting the last bit of my dry powder in[&#8230;].

      "summary": "According to an analyst on X, Bitcoin\u2019s grip on the market looks too strong for altcoins to break free any time soon. Bitcoin\u2019s price ticked up to around $104,000 after climbing 0.4%. It had dipped briefly to $103,000 but buyers stepped in fast. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant That push drove it back toward the $105K mark. At the same time, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, keeping traders on alert for any ripple effects. Bull Market Support Band Explained Based on reports, the Bull Market Support Band sits between two key moving averages. One is a 20\u2011week simple moving average. The other is a 21\u2011week exponential moving average. Together they form a zone that Bitcoin Dominance has used as a springboard all year.

Bitcoinsensus warns dominance could \u201cfall off a cliff\u201d before any altcoin season kicks off. That view suggests a sudden drop, maybe giving altcoins their moment. An analyst points to a possible double\u2011top pattern in dominance. If Bitcoin can\u2019t clear resistance, money might flow into altcoins. But if dominance breaks higher, some believe Bitcoin could aim for a fresh record. Limitations Of Dominance Metric Dominance only measures Bitcoin\u2019s share of total crypto market cap. It can slip if stablecoins flood in or if new tokens launch, even when altcoins aren\u2019t rallying. And a rise in dominance can mean altcoins are selling off. Related Reading: Iran\u2019s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links\u2014Details Traders should know that moving\u2011average support lines can fail in choppy markets. A pattern that works for months can break when the climate changes. In the end, the Bull Market Support Band offers a clear trend line. It shows that Bitcoin is still the favorite for many investors. Yet relying on one technical tool can miss bigger moves driven by real\u2011world news or fresh blockchain data. For now, though, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance looks safe\u2014unless something big shifts in the weeks ahead. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"
