      "summary": "Crypto analyst Investing Broz has spotlighted Cardano (ADA) as one of the most promising altcoins currently breaking out amid a shifting macro landscape and rising Bitcoin valuations. In his latest video update, the analyst identified ADA\u2019s recent technical breakout as a clear sign of bullish momentum, forecasting a price target of $1.90 in the coming weeks if momentum holds. Cardano Bull Run Is Back On Investing Broz began the segment by reiterating the broader context: Bitcoin\u2019s explosive rally above the $120,000 mark has reignited speculation around the arrival of altseason. \u201cThis is just one more egg in the basket of potentially altcoin season coming very soon,\u201d he noted, citing Bitcoin dominance breaking below a critical support level and altcoins \u201cgoing berserk.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano Price Explodes 30% In Past Week \u2014 Analyst Calls $5 Next Market Top Among the altcoins leading the charge, Cardano stood out. The analyst confirmed that he purchased ADA in the past 24 hours, identifying the move as more than just opportunistic. The trigger? A confirmed breakout above a long-standing resistance level that ADA hadn\u2019t pierced since March 1. \u201cThis is a major win for Cardano holders who are trading it,\u201d he said, explaining that a falling wedge pattern had been developing for weeks and now signaled a shift in trend. Investing Broz\u2019s trading group had initially positioned long at $0.54, with a modest target of $0.80. But as he emphasized, \u201cCardano is not just breaking above the smaller resistance level\u2014we\u2019re breaking above a resistance level we haven\u2019t been back above since March.\u201d That March breakout, he reminded viewers, was spurred by a now-infamous Donald Trump tweet listing altcoins deemed suitable for a proposed American crypto reserve. While that spike proved short-lived, the current breakout is, in his view, fundamentally and technically sound. To calculate a realistic upside scenario, he applied the traditional breakout target technique by measuring the height of the formation and projecting it forward. \u201cThis would give you a Cardano price prediction of $1.90,\u201d he stated, while also noting that such a target might be ambitious for a summer timeframe. Still, \u201cit\u2019s absolutely doable and definitely something you guys should be keeping an eye on.\u201d Related Reading: The Last Time This Happened Cardano Rose 55%, ADA Analyst Makes Bold The analyst reinforced his bullish outlook using confirmation from the LuxAlgo indicator suite, which flashed a weekly buy signal\u2014featuring a green reversal, bullish momentum, and positive money flow. Based on this, he offered a more immediate price range between $1.00 and $1.80. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to stop at $1.80, but I think it\u2019s a target to keep an eye on if you\u2019re looking for a trade,\u201d he said. Beyond that, a golden pocket Fibonacci extension points to a key level of $2.42 by year\u2019s end. However, Investing Broz was quick to clarify that these are not his full-cycle targets for ADA. \u201cThis is not my long-term bullish price prediction for this bull market,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cThis is simply tradable movements that I still think can happen over the next couple of weeks.\u201d His earlier predictions suggested ADA could hit $7 to $10 by the cycle top\u2014possibly extending into 2026 or even 2027. Throughout the segment, he stressed the importance of knowing when to take profit. \u201cEvery bull market has volatility. Cardano\u2026 is going to have volatile movements where they rally and then pull back,\u201d he advised. For short-term traders, targets around $1.80 to $2.40 may present ideal levels to secure gains or even explore short positions if momentum wanes. While ADA is not the only altcoin the analyst is tracking\u2014Ono and HAR were also highlighted for similar breakout behavior\u2014Cardano\u2019s confluence of technical strength, historical resistance flip, and volume surge make it a standout in the current environment. As the analyst concluded, \u201cThere\u2019s still time\u2026 this is a major breakout, and if you\u2019re a trader, this is what you wait for.\u201d Cardano, for now, has flashed its signal. Whether it makes good on the $1.90 target may depend not only on its own momentum, but on the broader timing of altseason\u2019s long-awaited arrival. At press time, ADA stood at $0.7447.

      "summary": "The bull market may be taking longer than expected to kick into its final gear, but the Bitcoin price structure remains bullish and steadily climbing within a rising trend channel. However, the potential upper targets have also moved higher, and might open the door to unprecedented price levels in the weeks ahead. Why The Bull Market Delay Might Be Good News Global uncertainties have delayed the second and possibly final phase of the current bull market in cryptocurrencies. According to master kenobi&#8217;s post on X, he noted that these delays may end up working in our favor. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO While Bitcoin and altcoins have remained within the boundaries of an ascending trend channel, the upper and lower limits of this channel are steadily rising, and showing resilience in market structure despite the external hesitation. If the second phase of the bull market ignited in April, projections suggest that the BTC upper limit might have topped out between $134,000 and $155,000. However, as this didn\u2019t happen, the upper limit has continued to climb, and if the 50-day pump pattern holds, the upper limit could be reached around August 11, at a range of $169,000 and $197,000. Naturally, this requires relative global stability. &#8220;Let\u2019s hope for another 30 days of calm, as 20 days have already passed,&#8221; the analyst added. Why Bitcoin Surge Is A Market-Wide Trigger In an X post, Davie Satoshi also mentioned that Bitcoin is on the verge of something big, that BTC is hovering in the middle of a multi-year bullish channel. It has been marked by long-standing green trendlines, and has just broken through the resistance level, which is indicated by a blue dotted horizontal line that has capped upside momentum until now.

The analyst stated that a rising tide lifts all boats, and that Bitcoin has always been the bellwether of the crypto market. They also suggest that BTC price could surge toward $180,000 to $200,000, with a potential top forming around late August to September, which will be followed by alt season and peaking in Q4 2025 to Q1 2026. The memecoins and altcoins continue to dominate the narrative in the crypto space this year. The next NFT season two will begin in January 2026, followed by the Bitcoin Ordinals in mid-year 2026. \u201cIt&#8217;s always a cycle, and Not Financial Advice, so gamble responsibly,\u201d he added.

This came as the analyst noted that the altcoin is already on the move, having recorded a 20% gain since its breakout. XRP Train Already On The Move To ATHs In an X post, Captain Faibik stated that the XRP train has already departed, with a rally to all-time highs on the horizon. The analyst noted that the altcoin has already surged over 20% since its breakout above $2.3. He had earlier predicted that the token was on the verge of a breakout, which would send it above its current ATH of $3.84. Related Reading: XRP Wave 3 Could Repeat 600% Surge From Nov 2025, Target Set For $15 Captain Faibik remarked that this bullish rally will send XRP to as high as $4.60. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto also indicated that a new ATH is in sight for the altcoin. In an X post, He stated that XRP needs to close the $3-day candle above the top wick of the March 2nd candle. The analyst told market participants to get ready for a new ATH if it closes above the $3.010 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also echoed Captain Faibik\u2019s sentiments, stating that XRP has just recorded a powerful breakout. He noted that the altcoin has confirmed a clean breakout from the multi-month descending triangle and revealed that the target is $3.80. This brings XRP to its ATH, which could pave the way for new highs. XRP boasts a bullish outlook, given its breakout from the crucial $2.30 support level that Captain Faibik and Titan of Crypto highlighted. The altcoin is now looking to reclaim the psychological $3 level, which would bring it close to its yearly high of $3.29.

Her accompanying chart showed that a clean break above this Fib level could send XRP to $3.4, which is the next major resistance after $3.04. A rally to this level would put its ATH well in sight.

      "summary": "Bitcoin rose above the $122,000 mark on Monday. According to data from CoinGecko, prices briefly topped that level before pulling back slightly. The jump comes in the face of strong inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional interest. Traders watched as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap set yet another record. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Awaits The Next Bitcoin Sale: \u2018My Fellow Pigs And I Are Feasting\u2019 Bitcoin ETFs Explode Based on reports, Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.20 billion flow in on Thursday alone. That was the biggest single\u2011day haul of 2025. Last week, QCP Capital said institutional flows into spot BTC ETFs topped $2 billion. These numbers suggest big players are betting on more upside. Open interest on futures now exceeds $43 billion. Funding rates on perpetual contracts are climbing too, showing crowded long positions. US President Donald Trump has voiced his support for clearer crypto rules. And on Monday, the US House of Representatives began debating a package of crypto bills aimed at giving firms more certainty. Companies have been adding bitcoin to their treasuries, with some corporate holdings rising by double\u2011digit percentages this year. According to BTSE COO Jeff Mei, longer\u2011term institutional buyers are driving prices higher. He forecasted that bitcoin could hit $125K \u201cin the next month or two.\u201d Mei also warned that trade disputes with the EU, Mexico and other partners might cause dips, but said buyers are holding firm. Rising Demand From Big Players Trading desks and crypto exchanges say they have seen fresh corporate orders. Some firms are buying blocks of 100 BTC or more at a time. Others are using dollar\u2011cost averaging to ease in gradually. Even smaller funds are boosting allocations, pushing aggregate demand higher. With every new all\u2011time high, more headlines appear and more investors pay attention. That creates a feedback loop: rising prices attract inflows, which lift prices further.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-supply-locked-hits-new-ath-smart-money-bets-on-long-term-growth/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has broken out above the $3,000 level, reaching its highest price since late January and signaling a strong resurgence in momentum. The move comes as Bitcoin continues to set new all-time highs, injecting renewed optimism into the broader crypto market. This week could prove pivotal, with the arrival of \u201cCrypto Week\u201d in the US Congress, when lawmakers will debate and potentially vote on critical legislation shaping the future of digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm Amid this renewed bullish backdrop, on-chain fundamentals are strengthening. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared data showing that the supply of ETH staked has just reached a new all-time high. This milestone reflects growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, with more investors locking up their assets to secure the network and earn yield, rather than sell into strength. The surge in price and staking activity suggests a shift in sentiment as Ethereum regains its position as a core asset in institutional and retail portfolios. With macro and regulatory catalysts converging this week, ETH could be on the verge of a major breakout, especially if legislative clarity and Bitcoin&#8217;s momentum continue to drive capital into high-conviction assets like Ethereum. Ethereum Leads Altcoin Revival: Strong Fundamentals And Technical Momentum Ethereum is showing renewed bullish strength, acting as a key driver in the broader altcoin market recovery. After a prolonged consolidation phase that lasted several months, ETH has finally broken above the critical $3,000 mark, setting a new bullish structure and signaling the start of a potential macro uptrend. The recent price action has energized sentiment across the market, with many altcoins beginning to follow Ethereum\u2019s lead. Fundamentally, Ethereum remains one of the strongest assets in the space. According to on-chain data by Ted Pillows, the percentage of ETH supply staked has reached a new all-time high of 29.44%. This metric is critical, as it reflects growing long-term conviction from large holders and smart money. When ETH is staked, it is locked up and cannot be sold, suggesting that investors expect higher prices and are committed to holding through volatility. All eyes are now on the key resistance zone between $3,500 and $3,600. If Ethereum manages to push through this area with conviction, it could trigger a broader breakout across the altcoin market. Many traders are closely watching this level as a catalyst for an explosive altcoin rally, fueled by increased capital rotation and technical momentum. A decisive break above resistance could validate the new bullish structure and mark the beginning of the next major expansion phase for ETH and the altcoin market at large. Related Reading: Pump.fun Public Sale Ends In 12 Minutes: Token Distribution Now Underway Ethereum Reclaims $3,000 With Bullish Breakout Above Key Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is showing strong bullish momentum on the 3-day chart, now trading at $3,071 after decisively breaking above the $2,850 resistance level. This breakout confirms a shift in trend structure following months of accumulation between $2,200 and $2,800. The recent surge has pushed ETH to its highest level since late January and sets the stage for a potential push toward the next major resistance at $3,500\u2013$3,600. The chart also reveals a bullish crossover as ETH trades above its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), now at $2,241, $2,658, and $2,801, respectively. This alignment indicates increasing buyer control and reinforces the strength of the uptrend. Notably, the breakout was supported by a spike in volume, adding further conviction to the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb \u2013 Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground With this momentum, ETH has formed a higher high on the macro timeframe, signaling the potential start of a broader trend reversal.
