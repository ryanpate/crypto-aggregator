      "summary": "After a powerful breakout last week that pushed Bitcoin into a new all-time high of $118,667, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency appears to be taking a breather. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $117,953, slightly below its recent peak. The move followed a string of consecutive daily gains as bullish momentum swept across the crypto industry. In a technical analysis shared on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst RLinda pointed out two scenarios that may play out over the coming days and weeks, depending on how Bitcoin reacts to nearby resistance and support levels. Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Support Zones Could Affect Bitcoin\u2019s Next Big Move RLinda\u2019s technical analysis begins with identifying the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s recent all-time high. Although Bitcoin has entered what seems to be a consolidation phase, there\u2019s no confirmed top just yet. The market structure still favors bullish continuation, especially considering Bitcoin is just coming out of a prolonged two-month consolidation zone and entering a realization phase. According to the 1-hour candlestick price chart, Bitcoin is currently trading just above a support area below $117,500. If Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, the leading cryptocurrency could kick off a cascade of corrections that could drive the price to $115,500, then potentially to $114,300, and even back to the previous all-time high of $111,800. Below that, the 0.5 and 0.705 Fibonacci levels around $113,031 and $111,960 respectively may act as temporary cushions. The last major defensive buy zone is around $110,400, where bulls may step in for a bounce. Basically, what this means is that if Bitcoin loses the support level at $115,500, it could slip back to $110,000 before encountering another strong buy support zone. Image From TradingView: RLinda Bitcoin To $125K, But It Must Breach Resistance First On the other hand, Bitcoin can still push above $118,000 and increase to $125,000, but only under certain conditions. The condition of the rally&#8217;s continuation depends primarily on Bitcoin registering a decisive daily close above $118,400 and $118,900. In her words, a daily close above these price levels would hint at a \u201cbreakout of structure.\u201d This, in turn, would confirm a transition from consolidation into another impulsive phase upward. In essence, both the bearish and bullish outlooks depend on how Bitcoin reacts at any of the important zones, either support at $116,700 or resistance above $118,400 before making a directional move. However, it is important to note that the consolidation after last week&#8217;s rally could last for weeks or even months, much like we&#8217;ve seen in previous rallies this cycle. According to the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric from Glassnode, Bitcoin\u2019s current level of long-term profitability sentiment is at 0.69. This is notably below the 0.75 mark associated with euphoric market conditions, despite Bitcoin having just printed a new all-time high. Image From X: Glassnode Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Bitcoin spent around 228 days above the 0.75 euphoria threshold in the previous bull market cycle. In contrast, this current cycle has only seen about 30 days above that level, which suggests long-term holders have not yet fully exited into profit and the leading cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t reached overheated conditions.

      "summary": "Ethereum has finally touched the $3,000 price level once again after spending weeks trading in a narrow range beneath $2,800. This recent breakout, although brief, marks the first time Ethereum reclaimed this level since early February. According to technical analyst Merlijn The Trader, Ethereum\u2019s next destination after breaking past $3,000 is already in sight. Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Bull Flag Breakout Points To Measured Move For Ethereum Ethereum went through an interesting rally last week alongside Bitcoin&#8217;s push to new all-time highs. However, this Ethereum price rally, which saw it touch $3,000 again, wasn&#8217;t based on momentum spillover from Bitcoin alone. This is because Ethereum itself experienced significant institutional interest from Spot Ethereum ETFs. According to data from SoSoValue, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined $907.99 million in inflows last week, their best week since the products launched in July 2024. Thursday, July 10, alone was highlighted by inflows of $383.10 million, making it the largest single-day inflow for any Ethereum ETF in 2025 so far. In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Merlijn pointed to a confirmed bull flag breakout on Ethereum\u2019s daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, the technical setup proposed by the analyst follows a falling wedge reversal that preceded the current uptrend. According to the chart attached to his analysis, the falling wedge that led to the reversal was formed from the December 2024 highs to the April 2025 lows, with the breakout occurring in mid-May. The breakout eventually saw Ethereum entering into a tight flag-like consolidation that spanned between May and June, until the most recent breakout above $2,700. That pattern has now resolved to the upside, and the next technical level of interest is a measured move based on the price action that formed the pole of the bull flag. This measured move places the next technical level of price interest at $3,834. Image From X: Merlijn The Trader 80% Of ETH Now In Profit On-chain indicators further validate Ethereum\u2019s current strength. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum&#8217;s price action has been dancing around the $3,000 mark since Friday, crossing it multiple times intraday. During this back and forth, 124.13 million ETH out of the 155.04 million total supply crossed into profitability, which represents 79.96% of all tokens. This reading is particularly interesting as it is the highest percentage recorded since January 2025. Image From X: Santiment The same data shows Ethereum is just 13 million coins away from matching the total supply in profit at its previous all-time high of profitability recorded in December 2024. This shift toward a profit-heavy network state tends to encourage holding behavior and long-term conviction, which could translate into reduced sell pressure in the coming week. This, in turn, could see Ethereum close a daily candle above $3,000 and move toward the $3,834 price target during the new week.

      "summary": "Popular market analyst with X username Daan Crypto has provided an important insight into the Ethereum market, stating the altcoin finds itself in a delicate price situation. Notably, Ethereum (ETH) prices crossed above $2,800, a critical resistance level, before briefly touching the $3,000 zone. During this period, the second-largest cryptocurrency registered market gains of 16.77% to produce a remarkable price performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Through 50EMA After Rejection, ETH Dominance Sees Resurgence Bulls Eye $4,000 As Long-Term Range Breakout Holds In an X post on July 12, Daan Crypto explains that $2,800 has acted as a long-standing resistance capping Ethereum price action on both sides over the past two years. Following recent bullish fortune, the prominent altcoin decisively broke through this price barrier, signaling intent for further price gains. However, the price retracement from $3,000 suggests the bulls are facing immediate profit-taking pressure that may force a return below $2,800. According to Daan Crypto, while a quick price dip and buy-back up may not harm current bullish sentiments, a stalled price action under $2,800 may force ETH to revisit lower levels around $2,100-$2,160. The analyst highlights that ETH bulls maintaining a price point above $2,800 is critical to sustaining the present bullish structure, paving the way for a price return to the market cycle peak at $4,000. From a risk/reward perspective, this level now offers traders a clear invalidation point that market bulls remain in control as long as ETH stays above $2,800. Interestingly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the ETH daily chart backs the potential of a sustained price uptrend. This is because the MACD line recently crossed above the signal line, which is largely interpreted as a bullish signal. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is valued at 71.12, in the overbought zone. This report suggests Ethereum holds strong potential of becoming an overheated market, resulting in a wide spread distribution. Related Reading: Dogecoin Megaphone Pattern Confirms Price Blowup, \u2018Don\u2019t Miss This Last Rally\u2019\u2014Analyst Ethereum Market Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,966 on the daily chart, reflecting a 0.11% decline in the past day. Despite the minor pullback, the asset has posted an impressive 16.53% gain over the past month, indicating that the majority of investors remain in profit. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Sentora, the Ethereum network recorded total network fees of $6.04 million, representing a modest 0.60% drop compared to the previous week. This slight decline in fees points to a small reduction in transaction activity on the network. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges registered outflows of $493 million, suggesting investors are opting to keep their assets in private wallets. Such behavior typically reflects growing confidence in the market, as users are less inclined to sell and more likely to hold in anticipation of continued price appreciation.

      "summary": "Solana (SOL) has registered a 0.58% loss in the past day, representing a slight price retracement from its strong weekly performance. Notably, the altcoin gained by nearly 10% in the last seven days as general crypto prices surged, pushing its unit price into the $160 price region. Amidst the present market cool-off, Ali Martinez has tipped Solana to embark on a parabolic rally subject to a particular market condition. Related Reading: Why The Solana Price Could Crash To $95 Before Reaching $200 Solana Bulls Eye Breakout As $170 Emerges As Critical Resistance In an X post on July 12, Martinez outlines a bullish technical analysis on the Solana market, stating the altcoin is at a key price juncture. Using the weekly chart, the analyst has been able to identify a mega cup-and-handle pattern, which usually precedes a major price rally. However, the altcoin faces a critical price resistance at the $170 region. For context, the cup-and-handle pattern is a popular bullish chart formation that indicates potential for significant price upswings. As seen in the chart below, it resembles the shape of a teacup, commencing with a bearish market, followed by a price recovery of equal magnitude as seen between the start of 2022 and the start of 2025. During this period, investors saw Solana prices crash from around $250 to a cycle low of $9.88 before experiencing a gradual return to a similar peak, thereby forming the cup pattern. Thereafter, SOL has experienced significant price corrections and rebounds, eventually creating a descending price pattern that represents the handle of this formation. Notably, the cup-and-handle pattern only translates into a price surge following a decisive price breakout above the formation&#8217;s neckline. Following recent gains, Solana finds itself within touching distance of this neckline at the $170 price mark. Martinez explains that a successful weekly close above this major resistance will validate the bullish intentions on Solana, inducing a heavy market demand and paving the path for higher price territories. Based on the Fibonacci retracement and extension levels on the chart, the initial price target in the event of this breakout is set at $295, instantly matching the current all-time high. However, the historical magnitude of breakouts from cup-and-handle pattern points to lofty price targets, such as $ $787, $1,314, and a max target of $2,744. However, a rejection at $170 may force Solana to visit lower support levels near $135 or even $100, which has served as a major demand zone in the past.
