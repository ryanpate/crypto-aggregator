      "summary": "Bitcoin has held steady around the $108,000 price level in recent days. After bouncing back from a brief pullback near $105,500 on Wednesday, Bitcoin recently tested $109,000 again in the past 24 hours. A popular crypto analyst has shared a long-term &#8220;Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet&#8221; that claims that the cryptocurrency has now entered into the final phase that will lead to massive price gains. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Declares Start Of Final Bull Phase In a recent post on X, Merlijn The Trader released what he dubbed the &#8220;Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet.&#8221; This cheat sheet is a breakdown of Bitcoin\u2019s past market movements that shows the distinct phases of bear markets, accumulation zones, and subsequent parabolic bull runs. The cheat sheet divides each of Bitcoin\u2019s two previous cycles from 2014 into three colored boxes: red for bear markets, orange for accumulation, and green for bull runs. Merlijn\u2019s chart traces this repeating structure over the past decade, showing how each bull market followed a similar rhythm that began after a lengthy consolidation period and ended with a strong price explosion. The first full cycle began with Bitcoin\u2019s peak around $1,000 in December 2013. Following that top, the price entered a long, painful bear market that spanned into 2015. This red-box phase eventually transitioned into accumulation, where Bitcoin traded sideways between $80 and $500 for a prolonged period. The green bull run box on the chart began around early 2017, and eventually ended with a peak just below $20,000 in late 2017. According to the cheat sheet, this entire cycle from peak to new peak lasted 1500 days. Bitcoin\u2019s second cycle kicked off after its December 2017 top. A long drawdown followed, and the bear market phase dragged Bitcoin down to $3,000 by the end of 2018. The chart marks this point with another red box, followed by the orange accumulation zone that stretched well into 2020. The cheat sheet\u2019s green box reappeared in late 2020 right as Bitcoin broke above its previous highs. The price shot up throughout 2021 and eventually reached a new all-time high around $69,000 in November of that year. This second full cycle was shorter than the first and spanned around 1400 days from the previous top. When Will The Next Bull Run Begin? The current cycle began with Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high in November 2021. Since then, the market has gone through its familiar sequence. A sharp decline into 2022 which bottomed around $15,000 represents the bear market phase. The decline was followed by nearly a year of sideways movement and slow recovery up until early 2025. This is represented as the orange accumulation box on the cheat sheet above. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is now in the next bull phase, and possibly the largest one yet. The chart projects a continuation along the long-term growth curve, possibly toward the $250,000 to $300,000 range over the coming year. Notably, the timeline for the entire cycle this time should take about 1,300 days from late 2021 to complete.

      "summary": "Bitcoin prices dipped by 0.93% in the last day after the premier cryptocurrency suffered another price rejection in the $110,000 range. This latest price pullback forces Bitcoin to maintain a consolidatory movement that has dominated the majority of last month drawing speculations about a potential market top. Interestingly, prominent market analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on this discourse stating that historical data shows that Bitcoin is yet to achieve a peak price for the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Bitcoin\u2019s Consolidation: A Preparation For Final Bull Leg In an X post on July 4, Ted Pillows shares a bullish market insight following another Bitcoin price dip. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency seemed on course to resume its market uptrend after a significant price rebound from $99,000 in late June following weeks of downward consolidatory movement. However, another decisive rejection in the $110,000 indicates Bitcoin\u2019s prices remain range-bound thereby worsening investors\u2019 concern across the market. In interpreting this situation, Pillows has called for calm stating the recent price dip is merely a \u201cleverage flush\u201d that requires no panic. Using a visual study on the BTC weekly chart, the renowned analyst shows that the current and previous price pullbacks are part of a predictable pattern that has played out across previous Bitcoin cycles. The chart shows that after each halving event, Bitcoin tends to peak approximately 18 months (518 days) later. With the most recent halving occurring in mid April 2024, the expected peak for this cycle would fall somewhere around Q4 2025, specifically on October 13, 2025, consistent with historical performance. Furthermore, a recurring 140-day rally window is also depicted in the chart, usually forming the final leg of the bull run. In each previous cycle, this 10-bar stretch delivered parabolic price movements. If history is rhyming once again, Bitcoin is now within range of initiating this 10-week bull run, suggesting the equivalent rally seen in previous could soon kick in. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A \u2018Powder Keg\u2019 How High Can Bitcoin Price Go? Based on Pillows\u2019 recent analysis, Bitcoin may be gathering momentum for its final rally of the present market cycle. The extent of this anticipated uptrend remains unknown; however, the presence of bullish factors most notably the high influx of institutional investment and the US pro-crypto policies supports a range of sky scraping targets. For example, Pillows has previously shared that the popular stock-to-flow model which uses Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity to project long-term price trajectory has predicted a potential price target of $368,925 by 2025 end. If this prediction holds true, Bitcoin investors are eyeing an estimated 242% from current market prices. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $108,299 reflecting a 0.83% gain in the past week. Featured image from The Economic Times, chart from Tradingview"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-fate-tied-to-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "In a recent X post, CryptoWzrd highlighted that Litecoin (LTC) closed the day on a slightly bearish note. He explained that LTC\u2019s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin\u2019s movement and overall market sentiment, with the $96 level standing out as the next resistance. Bearish Daily Close For Litecoin Amid Bitcoin Correlation According to CryptoWzrd, Litecoin closed the day with a bearish daily candle, while mirroring Bitcoin&#8217;s price action. This alignment suggests that LTC remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and BTC\u2019s directional moves. Meanwhile, the LTCBTC pair ended the session indecisively, offering no clear signal of strength or weakness against Bitcoin at the moment. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance \u2013 Bulls Target $97.10 Level The analyst noted that for a sustained upside move in Litecoin, healthier and more constructive candles are needed on the LTCBTC chart. Without stronger signals from this pair, confidence in a breakout remains limited. Adding to the cautious tone, CryptoWzrd pointed out that a decline in Bitcoin dominance would be a critical factor in unlocking altcoin momentum, including for Litecoin. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is currently aiming for the $96 daily resistance level. CryptoWzrd explained that a successful push above this barrier could open the door for a stronger rally, potentially extending toward the $128 resistance zone. However, that scenario depends on supportive market conditions and renewed strength across altcoin charts. On the downside, $80 stands out as the key daily support level that traders should monitor. A breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction and delay any near-term bullish ambitions. Maintaining support above this level would be crucial in preserving the broader structure and keeping upward targets in play. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd emphasized his focus on the lower time frames to spot potential scalp opportunities. By analyzing intraday chart formations, he aims to capitalize on short-term price movements while the broader market context unfolds. Traders following LTC closely will want to keep an eye on these short-term setups for quick entries and exits amid ongoing volatility. Intraday Volatility Signals Patience Over Action In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that today\u2019s intraday chart for Litecoin was marked by volatility and a bearish tone, making it a challenging environment for clean trade setups. He emphasized the importance of waiting for a more favorable trading location before entering any positions, as the current conditions lacked clear direction and structure. Related Reading: Litecoin Could Be \u2018Just Weeks Away\u2019 From Third-Ever Golden Cross \u2014 Expert According to the analyst, a move above the $90 intraday resistance would be a positive signal and could present a potential long opportunity. However, if the price gets rejected at that level, it may lead to further downside pressure. For now, CryptoWzrd remains patient, waiting for the market to establish a healthier setup before taking action. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-will-surge-35000/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Ripple Pundit has boldly predicted that the XRP price can surge 35,000%. He alluded to two things that need to happen for the altcoin to reach this ambitious target. Factors That Will Make XRP Price Surge 35,000% In an X post, Ripple Pundit stated that the XRP price will jump by over 35,000% on the day that Ripple makes their banking license public. He added that the SEC announcement of dropping its appeal will also boost the altcoin further. Ripple has applied for a national banking license with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Related Reading: Can The XRP Price Rally 1,538x To Reach $3,380? Shocking Prediction This move is expected to expand the crypto firm\u2019s services, which is bullish for the XRP price, considering the altcoin\u2019s role in Ripple\u2019s payment solutions. As such, XRP is likely to record more adoption, especially from institutional investors, as the crypto firm onboard more clients through this banking license. Crypto pundit Vincent Van Code also agrees that a Ripple banking license could have a massive impact on the XRP price. He recently predicted that the altcoin could rally to between $30 and $50. It is also worth noting that Brad Garlinghouse declared his 1,000% commitment to XRP, which indicates that the altcoin remains a huge part of the company\u2019s plans. Meanwhile, as Ripple Pundit predicts, an SEC announcement of its decision to drop its appeal in the lawsuit against Ripple would also boost the XRP price. Ripple has already announced its decision to drop its cross-appeal. All that is remaining for the long-running legal battle to end is for the Commission to also drop its appeal. A conclusion of the lawsuit would finally remove the legal uncertainty that had plagued the altcoin for a long while. The Next Wave For XRP Starts Here In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades declared that the next wave for the XRP price starts from the $2.23 level. She claimed that the altcoin has continued to show strength during this consolidation. The analyst added that the Ripple bank charter application added serious momentum at just the right time. The news helped push XRP above the $2.25 resistance. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Is Moving According To Plan, Here\u2019s Why $1.90 Is Important Commenting on the current price action, CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is now seeing rejection at $2.268, which is the .382 retracement of the local wave. She remarked that this suggests that XRP needs another low before launching higher. The analyst said that based on the technical indicators, the next best entry is lining up at $2.235. She explained that this level is the .236 retracement and that multiple internal subwave targets are clustering there. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.22, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/crypto-market-cap-on-track-to-4-5-trillion-as-q3-unfolds-details/",
      "summary": "Popular market analyst and key opinion leader (KOL) Ted Pillows is projecting the crypto market to hit a $4.5 trillion valuation before Q3 2025 ends. This interestingly bullish forecast comes off the back of another Bitcoin price rejection allowing the total crypto market cap to maintain the choppy price movement seen in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop \u2013 Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend Rally Ahead? Crypto Market Tests $3.5T Barrier In an X post on July 4, Pillows shares an insightful technical analysis on the total crypto market cap. Using the daily CryptoCap chart from Tradingview, the renowned analyst highlights the recent formation of a bull flag hinting at an impending price breakout. For context, the bull flag is a classic bullish continuation pattern. It starts with the formation of a flagpole i.e. a strong upward price movement, as seen between early April to late May when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. This structure is followed by the \u201cflag,\u201d i.e., a descending price channel that reflects a period of consolidation. This market action is seen from late May to the present, as the crypto market cap entered a temporary pullback phase. Pillows\u2019 analysis shows a complete bull flag formation. However, the crypto market cap must achieve a decisive price close above the $3.5 trillion mark which represents the upper boundary of the flag to confirm a price breakout. If this bullish scenario occurs, Ted Pillows predicts the crypto total market cap to surge to around $4.3 trillion &#8211; $4.5 trillion in Q3 2025. Considering its market dominance levels of 62.77%, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap could also rise to around $2.82 trillion in such bullish conditions providing a market price of $141,800 per unit. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the occurrence of an altseason amidst this crypto price surge could alter the projected market status for the premier cryptocurrency.

However, the ongoing crypto bull run has delivered an impressive 51.24% gain over the past year. The market leader, Bitcoin, is presently valued at $108,118 reflecting a 1.46% loss in the last 24 hours as previously stated. The maiden cryptocurrency is also witnessing a 14.40% fall in daily trading volume indicating crash in transactions and market activity. Featured image from Toptal, chart from Tradingview"
