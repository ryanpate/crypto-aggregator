      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-reaching-9-5-and-37-5/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has provided a detailed breakdown of how the XRP price could reach between $9.5 and $37.5. He alluded to previous cycles as the rationale behind why the altcoin could reach such ambitious targets in this market cycle. Rationale Behind XRP Price Rally To $9.5 And $37.5 In an X post, Egrag Crypto stated that historical cycles show that the XRP price always rises above the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and then retests it. He added that the final move from that retest point to the cycle\u2019s top creates the blowoff peak. In Cycle 1, XRP recorded around a 2,000% gain while the altcoin surged 455% from the retest point in Cycle 2. Related Reading: Analyst Puts XRP Cycle High At $20-$30, Here\u2019s Why Egrag Crypto then applied these percentages to the current cycle to show why the XRP price could reach $9.5 and $37.5. He noted that after the initial surge and retest in April 2025, the EMA will likely rise with the price, setting the stage for the next big move. Based on these historical blowoff phases, the analyst said that XRP could record another 2,000% increase and reach $37.5. On the other hand, the XRP price could mirror the second cycle and record a more conservative 455% rise, which puts the altcoin at $9.5. Egrag Crypto\u2019s accompanying chart showed that XRP could reach either of these targets by September 1 later this year. Meanwhile, the analyst advised market participants to choose their targets wisely. He also told them to set their exit plans, avoid getting caught up in hype, stick to their strategy, and get prepared. Breakout In Progress For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the $2.25 level is loading for the XRP price following its reclaim of the $2.07 level. Based on this price action, she remarked that a breakout was in progress. This $2.25 also represents the macro .382, a key level which the analyst has been alluding to for months. Related Reading: XRP Price Completes Bearish Retest As Macro Signals Point To $2.65 CasiTrades declared that momentum is building for the XRP price and that Ripple\u2019s decision to drop its cross-appeal against the SEC is further fueling this momentum. From the current level, she stated that she is watching two key scenarios in the short term. First, the altcoin could move into $2.30, then pull back to test $2.25 as support. The analyst remarked that this would be \u201cideal and healthy.\u201d For the second scenario, CasiTrades predicts that the XRP price could push harder through to $2.45, which is closer to the $2.69 resistance. Then, the altcoin would witness a slight pullback before touching the $2.69 level with resistance. For this scenario, she believes that a retest of $2.25 later would be expected. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Hours after Ripple Labs said it would abandon its long-running appeal in its securities case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, watched market technician CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) on X argued that XRP\u2019s price structure has already completed its corrective phase and is \u201cnow wave 3 in motion.\u201d The pseudonymous trader described how Friday\u2019s slide to $2.07 had \u201ctagged\u201d three separate Fibonacci confluence markers\u2014the 0.618 retracement of the March-to-May rally, a 1:1 equality projection for wave C of the prior correction, and a 0.618 extension of sub-wave 5. \u201cThe market snapped upward from that exact price,\u201d she observed, before adding: \u201c$2.07 tagged. $2.25 loading. XRP breakout in progress!\u201d XRP Enters Wave 3 By midday in Europe on Monday XRP was changing hands at $2.19, roughly 4% above Friday\u2019s close and 8.5% higher than a week ago. That recovery has carried the token to the edge of the next \u201cmajor test\u201d cited by CasiTrades: the long-monitored $2.25 zone, which she notes coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement measured from XRP\u2019s 2021 swing high. In classical Elliott Wave analysis, a decisive breach and subsequent retest of that level would validate the start of a powerful third wave, the phase in which momentum typically accelerates and sentiment flips decisively bullish. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish CasiTrades outlined two near-term paths: either a brief thrust to $2.30 followed by a healthy back-test of $2.25, or a more explosive extension toward $2.45\u20132.69 before any significant pull-back. \u201cFrom here, I\u2019m watching two key scenarios short-term: 1) A move into $2.30, then a pullback to backtest $2.25 as support. This would be ideal and healthy. 2) Or, price pushes harder through to ~$2.45, closer toward $2.69 resistance. Has a small pullback, before touching $2.69 with resistance. In this plan, a backtest of $2.25 later would be expected,\u201d Casi writes via X. In either scenario, she argues, the structural message is the same: \u201cFlipping that level opens the door for the next full breakout\u2026 once these local resistances are out of the way \u2192 fireworks.\u201d The technical argument lands at a moment when a key fundamental overhang appears to be fading. On June 27 Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company will withdraw the cross-appeal it filed last year contesting parts of Judge Analisa Torres\u2019s split decision on XRP sales. \u201cWe\u2019re closing this chapter once and for all,\u201d Garlinghouse wrote on X, adding that the SEC \u201cwas also expected to drop its appeal.\u201d The move came one day after Torres rejected a joint request from both parties to shrink Ripple\u2019s civil penalty to $50 million and dissolve her permanent injunction. Related Reading: XRP Bulls On Alert\u2014\u2019This Trendline Is Everything,\u2019 Says Analyst That backdrop helps explain why the Fibonacci \u201cgolden-ratio\u201d bounce at $2.07 drew such an emphatic response. But for now, the market\u2019s focal point is whether XRP can turn the $2.25 shelf from resistance into support. If it does, the next cluster of historical supply sits between $2.60 and $2.70\u2014the area that capped rallies in December 2021 and March 2022. A break beyond that zone would leave little chart resistance before psychological milestones at $3.00 and the all-time closing high near $3.40 set in January 2018. Even so, technicians caution that Elliott Wave targets remain probabilistic, not predictive certainties, and that any new macro-regulatory twist could reset the calculus. Friday\u2019s ruling also left Ripple\u2019s injunction intact, meaning the company must still navigate a compliance regime that did not exist when the lawsuit began in 2020. Whether those realities temper the exuberance around wave 3 remains to be seen. In CasiTrades\u2019 words, however, timing is everything: \u201cThis is exactly why we rely on TA. The charts help us spot setups before the news hits. News hits harder after price has positioned.\u201d For a market that has waited more than four years to see its signature legal saga reach closure, traders appear ready to test that maxim on the road to $2.25\u2014and beyond. At press time, XRP traded at $2.19. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Cardano is making moves to become a hub for Bitcoin DeFi. According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, the network has rolled out a string of upgrades, yet it still needs a strong message to win over users and investors. He argues that without a clear voice steering the story, those technical gains risk getting lost in the noise. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin\u2019s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength Network Champions New Features Cardano\u2019s team has added Leios, a new smart contract framework, and Hydra, a layer\u20112 scaling solution that promises faster transactions.

At the same time, Lace Wallet is gaining traction among everyday users, and USDM, a stablecoin backed by dollar reserves, is picking up steam. We got Leios, Hydra, Midnight, and Bitcoin DeFi alongside governance, security and decentralization. Bitcoin DeFi is indeed the largest opportunity, but the single biggest issue is that we are missing a competent Foundation and executive authority to push these narratives into\u2026 https://t.co/t3j4ULTTe8 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 29, 2025 Hoskinson Points To Executive Gap Despite those wins, Hoskinson says Cardano is missing a \u201ccompetent Foundation and executive authority\u201d to shape market views. He\u2019s taken to X to share his concerns, but some in the community have pushed back hard. A few podcasters and thought leaders have labeled Cardano a \u201cdying chain.\u201d Hoskinson admits that stepping into the narrative has drawn plenty of criticism\u2014yet he feels it\u2019s needed if Cardano is to claim its place in Bitcoin\u2011based finance.

He warns this work comes at a cost: \u201cIt\u2019s been brutal and expensive this year,\u201d he said, referring to waves of negative comments and legal threats. He adds that it\u2019s \u201cdehumanizing\u201d to be blamed for every hiccup on the network while not getting credit for the wins. Related Reading: Crypto Bombshell: Developer Claims XRP Could Hit $20,000 Rare Evo Conference In Focus Looking ahead, Hoskinson is counting on Rare Evo, a crypto conference, to reset the conversation.

There\u2019s even talk of a sovereign wealth fund to back Bitcoin DeFi on the chain. Built on top of Bitcoin, Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) is a network of decentralized financial applications. Last year, Hoskinson pushed a plan to convert $100 million worth of ADA into stablecoin liquidity. That idea sparked fierce debate. Now, he hopes Rare Evo will help turn bold ideas into solid support. Cardano\u2019s path forward may hinge on blending strong tech work with a clear, unified story.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-freezes-og-whales-dump-on-wall-street/",
      "summary": "While Bitcoin continues to hover above the $100,000 threshold, the driving forces behind this historic consolidation phase appear to be more complex than the surface-level narratives of institutional \u201cFOMO\u201d and ETF euphoria. According to multiple leading analysts, a silent rotation is underway\u2014one that suggests long-term holders are offloading their positions while corporate treasuries and institutional buyers quietly absorb the flood. OG Bitcoin Whales Are &#8216;Dumping&#8217; On Wall Street Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, delivered a sobering breakdown via X on June 29, challenging the prevailing belief that Bitcoin\u2019s price stagnation amid surging demand is anomalous. \u201cPeople are wondering why BTC has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDespite what X news might suggest, it&#8217;s because Bitcoin OGs (long-term holders) have been dumping on Wall St since the ETF Launch in January 2024, unloading their positions.\u201d Edwards, known for blending on-chain metrics with macro frameworks, pointed to a visible dynamic shift that is now being captured in blockchain data. While older coins are being redistributed, a newer class of holders\u2014primarily treasury-oriented entities\u2014are stepping in aggressively. \u201cWe have clearly entered the heat of [the Treasury Company] trend today as many copy-cats have entered the market,\u201d he said, referencing his earlier prediction on Bits and Bips that corporate adoption would eventually eclipse ETF inflows in relevance. What makes this transition particularly remarkable is the data behind it. Edwards highlighted that 6-month-plus BTC holders\u2014commonly associated with more strategic, non-speculative accumulation\u2014have skyrocketed in the past two months. \u201cThe amount of BTC acquired in the last 2 months by this cohort has completely consumed all of the BTC unloaded by LTHs over the last 1.5 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIncredible.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin In Stalemate With Liquidation Traps On Both Sides Of The Market This cohort&#8217;s aggressive accumulation, he added, has historically preceded bullish squeezes. \u201cWhenever aggressive spikes in 6M+ holders occur, price usually squeezes following these periods. Short-term bullish,\u201d Edwards remarked. However, he tempered the optimism by cautioning that broader on-chain data still signals fragility. \u201cIf the 6M+ holders (Treasury Companies) can continue their relentless buying, that should be achievable,\u201d he noted, signaling that the flywheel has momentum, but is not yet immune to systemic pressure. Adding another layer to this developing narrative, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Co-founder and CSO at Ledn, offered an alternative theory. He suggested that what appears as two flows\u2014LTHs selling and Treasury entities buying\u2014might in fact be \u201cthe same trade.\u201d He wrote, \u201cLong term holders [are] selling spot to buy ETFs/BTC Treasury Cos. Even though that feels unnatural for us bitcoiners.\u201d Di Bartolomeo framed the shift as generational, pointing out that many early adopters may simply be more comfortable in traditional financial custody rather than self-sovereign wallets. Related Reading: Analyst Spots Bitcoin Time Bomb Hidden In Bullish Weekly Chart But Edwards pushed back on that explanation, arguing that if ETF migration was driving the reclassification of long-term holders, it would be evident across multiple aging cohorts. \u201cI don&#8217;t think so because we would have seen a similar uptrend over time in the 6M+ and 1Yr+ cohorts if that was the case,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome is definitely moving to equities, but it&#8217;s very typical of this stage of the Halving cycle to see LTH selling into profit.\u201d Why Bitcoin ETF Do Not Have A 1:1 Effect On Price The apparent dissonance between rising demand and stagnant price has also prompted commentary from on-chain analyst TXMC, who warned that most observers misunderstand what actually sets Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cBitcoin people grossly underestimate how little of the supply is actually setting the price every hour,\u201d he wrote. He described Bitcoin\u2019s fragmented market structure as a web of siloed exchanges, loosely synchronized through cross-exchange market-making. \u201cEach location has its own liquidity and depth which vary wildly. A large market order can have an outsized effect depending on which exchange it is placed at, and which time of day.\u201d TXMC argued that while ETFs and institutional desks are accumulating large quantities of Bitcoin, much of this activity is routed through OTC desks that bypass order books entirely. \u201cThese actions do not affect the price in the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe desks source their own liquidity, and only have to go into the books to fill the difference.\u201d This explanation may help reconcile why ETF inflows in the billions of dollars have failed to push BTC significantly higher. Edwards\u2019 thesis aligns with this too, insofar as the ETF boom may be fueling redistribution rather than outright net demand. TXMC added: \u201cStop underestimating how many big entities are out there looking for exit liquidity.\u201d Despite growing bullishness in cohort composition, the real test lies ahead. Whether corporate treasuries and ETF managers can absorb the remaining exit waves of Bitcoin\u2019s earliest holders remains to be seen. But if Edwards is right, the rotation may already be past its critical phase. \u201cThe flywheel still has a long way to go,\u201d Edwards concluded. And if history is any guide, these moments of consolidation amid redistribution tend to precede volatility\u2014not follow it. At press time, BTC traded at $108,044.
