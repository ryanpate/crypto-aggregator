      "summary": "Crypto analyst InvestingScope has drawn market participants\u2019 attention to a major occurrence that hints at an imminent altcoin season. The analyst also revealed how high the crypto market could reach as altcoins outperform Bitcoin during this period. Altcoin Season May Be Imminent As Golden Cross Flashes In a TradingView post, InvestingScope revealed that altcoins have made a 1-day Golden Cross, the first since just right after the US elections. He noted that the rally that followed made new highs for these altcoins, indicating that another altcoin season may be on the horizon. The analyst also predicted that the total crypto market can reach at least $4.03 trillion on this rally. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises He noted that since the Bear Cycle bottom, this is the fourth 1-day Golden Cross and that the minimum the market has surged around such a formation was just over 73%. As such, the crypto market cap, currently valued at $3.39 trillion, can reach the $4 trillion target during this altcoin season rally. Altcoins have again rallied following the recent Bitcoin run close to its all-time high (ATH). The Ethereum price hit $2,900, coming close to the psychological $3,000 level. Additionally, the Solana price also hit $170, its highest level over the last 90 days. With two of the top major altcoins making these runs, this has further fueled optimism that altcoin season may be around the corner. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas told investors to get ready for a potential Altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way. This development could be the catalyst that sparks the altcoin season, with the SEC already asking issuers to amend their S-1 filings. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ETFs just hit a four-month high of inflows, with $240 million flowing into these funds on June 11. These funds have also witnessed 18 consecutive days of inflows as optimism grows about the SEC approving staking for these funds. This could be another catalyst for altcoin season as the Ethereum price usually leads the way. ETH/BTC Breakout Is Imminent In an X post, market expert Paul Barron indicated that the ETH/BTC breakout was imminent, a development which would usher in the altcoin season. He declared that Altseason is preparing for a face-melter and that the ETH/BTC breakout is \u201ccommitted\u201d. The expert added that with market sentiment up 2.8%, ETH will be the leader. Related Reading: When Will Altcoin Season Begin After Bitcoin Price Hit ATH Above $111,000? Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has also made a case for Ethereum to lead the altcoin season. In a recent analysis, he stated that from a technical perspective, ETH is looking solid at its current levels. The analyst claimed that $2,800 is the next resistance to clear out before a rally to a new high of $3,900. He added that Ethereum usually performs well near the peak of the cycle.

      "summary": "Ethereum is at a critical juncture after breaking above key resistance but failing to sustain momentum toward the psychological $3,000 level. The recent surge brought optimism to the market, yet ETH has now pulled back slightly, struggling to extend gains as global uncertainty weighs on sentiment. With macro pressures mounting and negotiations between the US and China over a potential trade deal in focus, the broader market appears to be awaiting clarity before making its next decisive move. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Top analyst Rekt Capital offered historical context to Ethereum\u2019s current setup, pointing to two previous cycles where ETH successfully retested the $2,500 level before launching toward $4,000. In August 2021 and again in early 2024, ETH held $2,500 as strong support (green circles), acting as the foundation for a major breakout rally. This repeating pattern has investors now eyeing the same level with growing interest. As Ethereum trades near $2,750\u2013$2,800, the coming days could determine whether this current setup mirrors past bullish cycles\u2014or if momentum fades again. With strong support beneath and a clear historical roadmap above, ETH\u2019s ability to reclaim strength could trigger the next leg in what many believe may be the start of altseason. Ethereum Echoes Past Patterns Ahead Of Potential Breakout Ethereum has rallied over 100% since its April lows, showcasing powerful momentum and heightened activity at current levels. After briefly tapping a local high near $2,830, ETH has retraced slightly but remains firmly above the $2,750 mark\u2014a key area that now acts as short-term support. The strength of this rebound is fueling growing speculation that Ethereum may not only be preparing for another leg up but also setting the tone for a broader altseason. Analysts across the board are closely watching ETH\u2019s current consolidation, with many citing historical patterns as a reason for optimism. Notably, Rekt Capital highlighted a recurring pattern that has previously led to significant rallies. In August 2021, Ethereum successfully retested the $2,500 level as support before surging to approximately $4,000. The same thing occurred in early 2024, when ETH once again bounced from $2,500 and rallied to the same zone. Now, for the past five weeks, Ethereum has repeatedly confirmed the $2,500 level as solid support, forming what appears to be a textbook foundation for another major move. This accumulation phase\u2014mirroring past cycles\u2014has many traders confident that ETH could soon reclaim $3,000 and begin leading altcoins higher. With macro conditions still uncertain and market participants looking for signals of strength, Ethereum\u2019s behavior at these levels carries added significance. If ETH can maintain its position above $2,750 and build momentum through $2,830, the market could see an explosive shift in sentiment, potentially triggering the next phase of the bull cycle. For now, all eyes remain on Ethereum as it tests the top of its multi-week range with bullish conviction. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance \u2013 Breakout Or Breakdown? ETH Holds Above Breakout Zone After $2,830 Rejection Ethereum is currently trading at $2,749 on the 4-hour chart, holding above a key breakout zone between $2,700 and $2,740 following a brief rejection at $2,830. After breaking above this multi-week resistance last week, ETH surged into higher territory before pulling back in the last few sessions. Despite this retrace, the price has so far maintained support above the previous resistance area, now acting as a strong demand zone. This range\u2014highlighted by the yellow box on the chart\u2014served as a ceiling for nearly a month before being flipped into support during the breakout. Ethereum is now consolidating right above this area, and as long as it remains above the 50 and 100 simple moving averages (SMAs), the bullish structure is intact. Volume has started to cool off slightly, suggesting that traders are waiting for a decisive move\u2014either a bounce toward $2,800\u2013$2,900 or a breakdown back below $2,700. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level \u2013 No Clear Breakout Yet A successful hold of this support zone could confirm the retest and build momentum for another breakout attempt. However, failure to hold $2,700 could see ETH revisit the 200 SMA around $2,570. For now, Ethereum remains technically strong, but traders are watching closely for confirmation.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-19500-with-hs-pattern/",
      "summary": "Ethereum reclaimed a significant technical level in the latest 24-hour trading session, with its price crossing above the $2,800 mark and briefly touching $2,870. This interesting cross makes it the first time since February 2025 that Ethereum has traded above the $2,800 threshold. The move comes amid rising bullish momentum flowing out from Bitcoin, and according to recent analysis from a crypto expert, this could be just the beginning of a much larger rally for Ethereum. Technical Pattern Says Ethereum Could Be Close To $20,000 An interesting technical formation on Ethereum has now caught the attention of some traders: a classic inverse Head and Shoulders bottom. According to crypto expert Gert van Lagen, who shared his analysis on the social media platform X, this inverse head and shoulders is setting up on a long-term timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Specifically, Ethereum&#8217;s two-week candlestick chart, shared by the analyst, reveals a fully formed structure with a left shoulder in mid-2021, a pronounced head that took shape during the bear market in late 2022 to early 2023, and a right shoulder forming throughout the 2024 correction into early 2025. The left shoulder emerged in mid-2021, when Ethereum\u2019s price peaked around $4,870, then retraced into the year-end. The head was formed at the lows around $1,350 in 2022 and 2023. The right shoulder is currently in formation after the Ethereum price rebounded from roughly $1,600 in 2025. Finally, this pattern is also highlighted by a symmetry around the neckline drawn near the $4,200 price region. Keeping this in mind, the neckline of the pattern, which is anchored just below the $4,200 resistance level, is now the most important level to break above. A confirmed breakout above this zone could activate the full bullish target projected by the technical formation. ETH Price Close To $20,000 According to Gert van Lagen, the two-week head-and-shoulders pattern suggests Ethereum may be \u201ccloser to $20K than most anticipate.\u201d His price target calculation follows a classic technical methodology. By measuring the vertical distance from the head\u2019s lowest point to the neckline resistance and then projecting that same distance upward from the neckline, he arrives at a target of approximately $19,500, which is more than a 600% gain from today\u2019s price levels. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric In the same analysis, van Lagen also highlighted a descending broadening wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-2023. This secondary structure reinforces the notion that Ethereum may embark on a significantly larger breakout once $4,200 is cleared. However, this projection of $19,500 is based on the technical symmetry of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, rather than fundamental shifts in Ethereum. Additionally, there is no clear timeline for this target; however, based on the multi-year nature of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the price target may also take up to four years to materialize. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,772, having retraced slightly from $2,870. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "DeFi Development Corp. hit a major roadblock this week when the US Securities and Exchange Commission blocked its $1 billion registration filing. The move came after regulators found that the company\u2019s Form S-3 lacked a key internal controls report tied to its 10-K. As a result, DeFi Development\u2014formerly known as Janover\u2014pulled the filing and said it will fix the paperwork before trying again. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Missing Controls Report According to the SEC, the registration was ineligible because it did not include the required internal controls over financial reporting. That report is a must for any firm raising capital through public offerings. Without it, the commission won\u2019t even consider your request. DeFi Development filed in late April 2025 but overlooked this step, a basic requirement in US securities law. DeFi Development (formerly Janover) has withdrawn its $1 billion Form S-3 registration after the SEC deemed it ineligible due to missing a required internal controls report in its Form 10-K. No securities were issued, and part of the proceeds had been intended for purchasing\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 11, 2025 Plan To Buy Solana Based on reports, the company aimed to use the funds to buy Solana tokens. Solana ranks as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The filing showed some of the $1 billion would go toward staking rewards and token purchases. Staking can earn regular returns, but only if SOL holds or gains value. Putting such a large stake into one chain carries risks if market prices dip. Withdrawal And Next Steps DeFi Development confirmed that no securities were issued during this process. It said it plans to refile once the controls report is in place. A quick resubmission\u2014perhaps within 30 or 45 days\u2014would signal they were almost ready. Investors will watch whether the company brings in an experienced underwriter or auditor to prevent another slip. Related Reading: TRX Price Up As Tron Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Trump-Backed Stablecoin Market Reaction Some traders had hoped the influx of a billion dollars in Solana tokens would boost the price. Now that the filing is on hold, those bets may stall. Markets often react when big purchases are delayed. Based on trading patterns, any sudden buy order of hundreds of millions in SOL could swing prices up or down. What Comes Next DeFi Development\u2019s experience highlights that crypto firms must meet the same rules as any other public issuer. Skipping standard checks can derail even the boldest plans. The company\u2019s next move will show how well it can balance its blockchain ambitions with straightforward regulatory steps. For now, the token-buy plan waits in limbo, and everyone from investors to developers will be watching the next filing. Featured image from Reuters, chart from TradingView"
