      "summary": "Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun has lost a significant chunk of its market share to LetsBonk.fun. This comes just ahead of the former\u2019s token generation event, in which the launchpad could raise up to $4 billion. Solana\u2019s Pump.fun Loses Dominance To LetsBonk.fun In an X post, Solana News revealed that Pump.fun has hit a new all-time low with just a 36% market share, while LetsBonk.fun\u2019s market share has surged to 54%. Jup data also confirms this development. At press time, LetsBonk boasts a market share of 48.90%, with a 24-hour trading volume of $539 million. On the other hand, Pump boasts a market share of 39.80%, with a 24-hour trading volume of $438 million. Related Reading: Analyst Says Buying This Meme Coin Is A 3X Leveraged Play If Solana ETFs Go Live This development comes amid Pump.fun\u2019s proposed public token sale, scheduled for July 12. Well-known Solana influencer Lynk has described this token sale as the \u201cfinal scam\u201d for the meme coin launchpad. The platform has been under heavy criticism for the amount of money that it has extracted from the Solana ecosystem, without incentivizing community members in any way. Some community members had expected Pump.fun to airdrop its token to rewards platform users instead of conducting a public token sale. Lynk shared details of the public sale, with the meme coin launchpad planning to sell the \u2018PUMP\u2019 tokens $0.004 each. The token boasts a total supply of 1 trillion, meaning a fully diluted value (FDV) of $4 billion. However, Pump.fun plans to raise around $600 million from the public token sale, as only $150 billion tokens will be available. The meme coin launchpad is expected to also conduct a private sale in order to complete its $1 billion capital raise effort, as earlier reported. LetsBonk.fun To Keep Dominating Pump.fun In an X post, crypto influencer Unipcs, also known as \u2018Bonk Guy,\u2019 opined that Pump.fun isn\u2019t done, but that LetsBonk.fun will likely continue to be the industry leader. He predicts that this will be the case for the foreseeable future. He outlined several reasons why he believes this would be the case. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs Firstly, he stated that LetsBonk\u2019s pro-creator, pro-people, pro-Solana ecosystem alignment is a massive strength over Pump.fun. Secondly, Bonk Guy remarked that the strong culture of support within the BONK ecosystem is incredibly hard to replicate by any other platform in a short period. Furthermore, the crypto influencer remarked that Pump.fun had a lot of momentum as a tokenless protocol, especially with a token generation event (TGE). However, LetsBonk.fun was able to flip the platform during this period. As such, Bonk Guy believes that it is hard to see Pump.fun sustainably recover the kind of market share it once had after the TGE event. He also suggested that a \u201cnon-negligible amount of activity on Pump.fun is inorganic with a lot os users farming on the platform, hoping that there was going to be an airdrop. As such, the influencer believes that the traffic will dry up once the TGE is over. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Meme coin TRUMP made waves when it launched on Solana on January 17, 2025, issuing 200 million tokens out of a planned supply of 1 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details According to trading data, its price shot from under $10 to a whopping $80 within hours, pushing its fully diluted valuation to nearly $75 billion. But by July 2025, TRUMP had tumbled back to $8.60, a 90% drop from its peak. Its circulating market cap now sits around $1.70 billion, with a fully diluted value of about $8.60 billion. Cross Chain Push Into Tron Based on reports from the project\u2019s official X account, TRUMP plans its first expansion beyond Solana by launching on the Tron blockchain. This move is designed to tap Tron\u2019s large user base and faster transaction speeds. Tron boasts over 100 million accounts and sub\u2011second confirmations, which the TRUMP team believes could fuel a fresh wave of buyers and traders. $TRUMP on #TRON is coming. Stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/S5WfV8APvU \u2014 TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) July 7, 2025 Volatile Price Swings Define TRUMP TRUMP\u2019s rollercoaster debut underlines extreme volatility. After the initial frenzy in January, the coin\u2019s price plummeted by 88% from $80 to $8.60. That slide erased roughly $65 billion in valuation. Today\u2019s price reflects speculative trading rather than any long\u2011term adoption. Investors who rode the peak saw massive gains briefly, then steep losses just as quickly. Justin Sun\u2019s Big Stake On May 20, 2025, Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted that he is TRUMP\u2019s largest holder. He reportedly owns nearly $19 million worth of tokens after a $75 million investment in Trump\u2019s World Liberty Financial platform. Sun\u2019s position comes with perks. He won a \u201cprivate dinner\u201d alongside the top 220 token holders, securing a seat at US President Donald Trump\u2019s Virginia golf club. Critics say that kind of setup blurs the line between crypto hype and pay\u2011to\u2011play politics. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Central Control Raises Warnings Two Trump\u2011affiliated companies, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, control 80% of TRUMP\u2019s token supply. Those tokens are locked under a three\u2011year vesting schedule. Analysts warn that when insiders hold such large shares, they can sway prices at will. That level of centralization runs counter to crypto\u2019s promise of open and fair systems. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley have called for new rules to curb how politicians and their allies can launch or endorse digital coins. They argue that projects like TRUMP could be used for personal gain or campaign boosts, creating a need for clearer boundaries. Traders And Regulators Brace For Tron Launch As TRUMP eyes a Tron debut, traders and regulators alike will watch closely. The move could spark a fresh surge in trading volume. Yet the same factors that drove its initial spike\u2014viral hype, insider perks, and a heavy token concentration\u2014could just as easily lead to another steep plunge.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-next-move-hinges-on-2-35/",
      "summary": "XRP is showing mixed signals across timeframes, leaving traders on edge as the price approaches the key $2.35 level. While a recent breakout from a falling wedge on the 3-day chart suggests a bullish reversal, the 4-hour chart reveals signs of slowing momentum and a possible rising wedge. With buyers and sellers locked in a battle, $2.35 could be the tipping point that decides whether XRP surges higher or slips into a near-term correction. XRP Breaks Out Of Falling Wedge On 3-Day Chart In an X post, LSplayQ highlighted a key technical development on the XRP 3-day price chart, pointing to a breakout from a falling wedge pattern. This type of pattern is commonly associated with bullish reversals, signaling that market sentiment may be shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: XRP Silent Accumulation: A Falling Wedge On The Verge Of Explosion Following the breakout, XRP is currently trading around $2.26, and according to LSplayQ, the move suggests that buyers are stepping back in to reclaim control. The price action marks a significant shift after an extended period of downward compression within the wedge. If the bullish momentum continues, LSplayQ notes that XRP could target a breakout level near $2.72, which represents an upside potential of roughly 20% from the current price. That said, LSplayQ also warns of the risk of a pullback if XRP fails to hold above the wedge breakout level. In such a scenario, the price could retest the $2.10 zone as a potential support. Overall, the technical outlook leans bullish, as long as XRP maintains its position above the breakout level. Rising Wedge Pattern Signals Caution Ahead In a post on X, The Crypto Bushman pointed out that XRP is pushing higher on the 4-hour chart, but warned that seasoned traders are keeping a close eye on what lies beneath the surface. Related Reading: XRP Price Pops and Drops \u2014 Can Bulls Regain Control? According to the analyst, the price is currently trading above both the 20- and 50-day EMAs, which typically signals short-term strength. However, the overall structure appears to be forming a rising wedge, a pattern often linked to potential reversals. At the same time, momentum is beginning to fade, with the MACD flattening and volume tapering off, which Bushman describes as classic signs of a potential trap move. The Crypto Bushman emphasized that a failure to break cleanly above $2.35 could lead to the setup rolling over. In that case, the $2.25 zone becomes a critical level to watch for a possible breakdown and shift in sentiment. On the flip side, a strong breakout backed by volume could fuel another leg up toward $2.50 if buying pressure returns decisively. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

Adoption started slowly around mid\u20112023. It rose further in early 2024. Then by January 2025, the line on the stacked chart shot straight up. That jump comes as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton pour in fresh tokens. Faster trades and fewer middlemen are big draws. Trades that once took days can now settle in minutes or seconds. That kind of speed appeals to big investors, who want clarity and a clear audit trail. This push into tokenized finance shows a shift in how big firms manage money.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/2025-biggest-bitcoin-bull-trigger-still-hidden/",
      "summary": "In a conversation with The Bitcoin Economy podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart argued that the next, and potentially largest, leg of institutional demand for spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds will not come from pension funds, endowments, or sovereign wealth managers. Instead, it will arise when the country\u2019s fragmented network of registered investment advisers (RIAs) finally gains full discretionary clearance to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to ordinary clients. \u201cThe biggest bull case for the ETFs has been the unlocking of RIAs in 2025,\u201d Seyffart said. \u201cRight now the vast majority of the assets are stuck in that middle ground where, if a client specifically asks to buy a Bitcoin ETF, the adviser can act\u2014but the adviser cannot initiate the recommendation.\u201d The Biggest Bull Case For Bitcoin In 2025 Seyffart broke the compliance bottleneck into a traffic-light schema that most financial advisers will recognise. A red-light firm bars Bitcoin entirely; a yellow-light firm permits unsolicited purchases (\u201cIf you come to me and ask for it, I can do it\u201d); and a green-light firm allows the adviser to solicit an allocation (\u201cI can recommend that you put two percent of your portfolio in Bitcoin\u201d). Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut\u2014What You Need To Know Wire-house broker\u2013dealers\u2014which still custody trillions of dollars\u2014largely remain in the red or yellow camps, paralysed by multi-year due-diligence committees. Independent RIAs, by contrast, \u201cwere the early adopters,\u201d Seyffart noted, because they \u201cdon\u2019t have to wait for a due-diligence team of a bunch of people sitting in New York.\u201d Yet even among independents, most advisers outsource portfolio construction to centralised model portfolios; until those models flag Bitcoin ETFs as eligible holdings, discretionary uptake will stay muted. Seyffart\u2019s focus on 2025 is calendrical, not calendrical: the first full-calendar year after launch gives compliance teams twelve months of daily NAV history\u2014often a hard requirement before a new ETF can graduate from yellow to green status. \u201cUsually it can take two to three years before an ETF gets approved,\u201d he said, but the extraordinary size and liquidity of the spot-Bitcoin cohort is already accelerating that cycle. Crucially, the next Form 13F reporting deadline on 15 August 2025 will reveal second-quarter holdings as of 30 June. Seyffart expects the data to confirm that \u201ca lot more RIAs have come online and [are] buying this for their clients,\u201d providing the first concrete measure of green-light conversions. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned If the gatekeeping retreats, model-portfolio architects can incorporate Bitcoin\u2019s historically uncorrelated returns into strategic-allocation frameworks. That in turn would grant advisers legal cover to solicit Bitcoin exposure, unleashing a flywheel of inflows. Seyffart cautioned that the same compliance teams will demand iron-clad fiduciary justifications\u2014volatility, custody and tax treatment remain live concerns\u2014but he argued that the ETFs now provide a wrapper familiar to any wealth platform. Seyffart\u2019s thesis is that the moment a critical mass of compliance committees flips from yellow to green\u2014allowing advisers to recommend Bitcoin rather than merely transact it\u2014flows could dwarf everything seen to date. Whether that inflection arrives in the next 12 months will determine, in his view, \u201cthe biggest bull case for Bitcoin.\u201d At press time, BTC traded at $108,250.
