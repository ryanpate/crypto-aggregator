      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/30b-in-bitcoin-added-by-accumulator-wallets-are-long-term-players-preparing-early/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high once again, surging to $123,200 earlier today, a move that has reignited bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. After weeks of steady consolidation and strong institutional inflows, the top cryptocurrency continues its upward momentum, breaking past key psychological levels and entering uncharted territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm One of the most notable developments fueling this surge is the rise in demand from so-called \u201caccumulator\u201d addresses. According to top analyst Darkfost, these wallets\u2014classified by their consistent behavior of only accumulating BTC without any history of selling\u2014have hit a new record high in 2025. This group of addresses is often associated with high-conviction holders, including long-term retail investors, institutional participants, and funds with strategic positioning. The spike in accumulator activity reveals a deeper layer of confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trajectory. Even with BTC above $120,000, these addresses continue to stack sats aggressively, suggesting that smart money is not waiting for lower prices. Instead, they appear to be preparing for a potential continuation of the bull cycle. Accumulators Add BTC, But Will They Hold Through Volatility? As of today, Bitcoin accumulator addresses have collectively added approximately 248,000 BTC, well above the monthly average of 164,000 BTC. This significant uptick highlights a sharp increase in demand over a short period, indicating that long-term players are actively positioning themselves despite Bitcoin continuing to post new all-time highs. These addresses, often associated with entities that have never sold BTC, are typically viewed as highly sophisticated investors with long-term horizons. The recent surge in accumulation suggests these players see continued upside potential, even after Bitcoin reached $123,200. Their behavior reflects strong market confidence and a belief that the current rally may be far from over. However, there is a caveat. If Bitcoin enters a phase of correction or prolonged consolidation, some of these addresses may begin to exit their positions. Doing so would strip them of their accumulator status and introduce substantial selling pressure into the market. With the 248,000 BTC added now worth around $30 billion, any significant liquidation from this cohort could impact short-term price stability. This week will be particularly crucial. The highly anticipated \u201cCrypto Week\u201d in Washington begins, with the US House of Representatives scheduled to discuss and vote on key crypto regulatory bills. The outcomes could drive volatility and influence whether these accumulators continue to hold or begin to fold.

This breakout follows weeks of consolidation between the $103,600 and $109,300 levels, during which Bitcoin established a solid base of support. The move was accompanied by a notable surge in volume, confirming strong buyer conviction behind the rally. Technically, BTC is now trading well above its 50, 100, and 200-period simple moving averages (SMAs), which currently sit at $110,795, $108,079, and $106,980, respectively. The bullish alignment of these moving averages supports the ongoing uptrend and indicates that buyers have regained full control of the market structure.

      "summary": "The Bitcoin price is once again commanding the spotlight as bullish momentum propels the leading cryptocurrency to new all-time highs. With the price already breaking past the $122,000 mark, analysts are growing increasingly confident in the potential for even higher targets. A recently shared chart analysis by market expert CrediBull Crypto suggests that the current rally is far from\u2014and most importantly, no major dips are expected along the way. As a result, he has forecasted that BTC could see a significant price surge to $155,000 soon. Bitcoin Price Action Clears Path To $155,000 Bitcoin\u2019s momentum continues to gather steam, with technical indicators from CrediBull Crypto\u2019s wave analysis report signals a bullish continuation that could propel the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to $155,000 in the coming weeks. The analyst\u2019s new wave count projection suggests that Bitcoin is firmly in the middle of a powerful upward leg, with minimal signs of a pullback ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Break Above $118,000 Just The Start, Analyst Unveils \u2018Golden Number\u2019 CrediBull Crypto\u2019s shared price chart highlights a well-formed textbook Elliott Wave structure that suggests that Bitcoin is in the early stages of a strong Wave 3. Notably, BTC\u2019s recent breakout above the $112,000 range shifted market sentiment in a bullish direction. What once served as resistance was quickly flipped to support, and now price action is clearing a path toward even higher ATH targets as momentum continues to build. A critical factor supporting the analyst\u2019s optimistic BTC outlook is the daily demand zone between $98,000 and 101,000. This area served as the launch point for the previous rally above $112,000 and has remained untested ever since. With selling pressure diminishing and strength building, CrediBull Crypto believes that the price of Bitcoin will stay well above the $110,000 level. He also views a retest to $112,000 or a decline to $110,000 or below as highly unlikely under current bullish conditions. According to the analyst, Bitcoin&#8217;s projected path forward places it near $135,000 by the completion of Wave 3, followed by a brief period of consolidation before a final push toward $155,000. Bitcoin Rise Above $120,000 Is Just The Beginning As Bitcoin continues its ride above $120,000, Crypto Fella, a market expert on X, has cited the potential for the cryptocurrency to enter price discovery mode and skyrocket to uncharted levels. The analyst\u2019s chart highlights a well-defined ascending trendline beginning in early 2023, with three distinct rally zones marked by purple rectangles. Each of these phases showcases consolidation followed by an aggressive upward move, suggesting a clear pattern of accumulation and breakout.

A key target identified in Crypto Fella\u2019s analysis sits around the $138,206 level, which aligns with the projected continuation along the trendline. This level represents the next major psychological resistance and could mark the entrance into a new phase of price discovery. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Shaco AI, in a fresh update, highlighted that Bitcoin is showing off its moves, dancing upwards past both the 25-hour ($119,088.50) and 50-hour ($118,338.56) Simple Moving Averages. With such momentum, it\u2019s clear BTC has decided it&#8217;s not a bear season yet. Momentum And Indicators Shaco AI\u2019s analysis on Bitcoin dives deep into the technical indicators, and there\u2019s no shortage of bullish energy in the air. First off, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently riding high at 86.02. That\u2019s well into overbought territory, and as Shaco colorfully put it, \u201cit might need to hydrate soon.\u201d Such elevated RSI levels often signal a potential cooldown on the horizon, but for now, momentum is favoring the bulls. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape Adding fuel to the trend is the Average Directional Index (ADX), which sits at a robust 44 points. According to Shaco AI, this reading confirms that the current uptrend is strong and well-supported. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is also reinforcing this bullish narrative, with a reading of 967.98. Shaco described it as \u201cscreaming positive vibes,\u201d a signal that buying pressure continues to dominate. A rising MACD in conjunction with a strong ADX often paints a picture of confident market participants driving the trend with conviction. One of the most telling signs is volume. Shaco pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume has surged to 2704.5, a significant leap above its average of 856.81. He described this as \u201csome serious weight lifting in buying interest,\u201d underscoring that this isn\u2019t a weak or speculative move \u2014 traders are putting real capital behind the rally. Support And Resistance: Bitcoin Make-Or-Break Levels The analyst went further to highlight key levels traders should closely monitor. He noted, &#8220;Key Levels Alert: Keep an eye on the resistance at $122,666.0 and support sitting firm at $116,900.05. It feels like Bitcoin is playing &#8216;The Floor is Lava&#8217; with support levels!&#8221; This colorful analogy points to the importance of holding key support to maintain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidation Continues: 2 Key Support Levels To Watch According to Shaco AI, if Bitcoin can sustain a move above the current resistance zone, traders might want to watch for a potential breakout. However, with the RSI already deep in overbought territory, there&#8217;s also the possibility that BTC may \u201cpeak too soon,\u201d leading to a pullback or brief consolidation phase.

      "summary": "The Dogecoin weekly structure is once again the talk of Crypto-Twitter after pseudonymous technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) published a logarithmic Fibonacci road-map for the meme-coin\u2019s fourth bull cycle. The chart, built on TradingView and shared on 13 July, anchors the entire 2021\u20132022 range and projects both horizontal retracement levels and upward-sloping Fib-channels, offering a granular set of targets. Dogecoin To $23? At Friday\u2019s close DOGE changed hands near $0.20, almost exactly against the 0.5 retracement line, highlighted on the graphic at $0.19049. The overlay shows price compressing inside a three-year ascending channel whose lower rail has provided support since the June 2022 capitulation. Volatility has been fading inside that corridor, shaping a broadening wedge that has so far respected every golden-ratio diagonal printed on the chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It\u2019s No Meme Cantonese Cat\u2019s horizontal grid begins with the cycle floor\u2014Fib 0 at $0.04909\u2014and climbs through a dense cluster of intermediate resistances: 0.618 at $0.26232, 0.707 at roughly $0.33, 0.786 at $0.41368 and 0.886 at $0.54253. The 1.0 line\u2014Dogecoin\u2019s May 2021 macro-top\u2014is fixed at $0.73905 and forms the upper boundary of what the analyst calls \u201cthe first liquidity wall.\u201d Above it, blue extensions extend far beyond previous cycle extremes: 1.272 at $1.54518, 1.414 at $2.27089 and 1.618 at $3.94842. Super-cycle projections appear at 2.0 ($11.12397) and the headline-grabbing 2.272 extension at $23.25744\u2014levels the trader himself stresses are \u201cpurely imaginative unless unprecedented liquidity flows in.\u201d Golden channels running diagonally across the whole canvas translate the same ratios into time-adjusted dynamic support and resistance. Internal rails marked 0.236 and 0.382 have repeatedly capped minor rallies since mid-2022, while the 0.5 diagonal is now acting as an inflection point underneath spot price. The current weekly candle is probing that rail from above, echoing the analyst\u2019s separate Ichimoku view that DOGE is \u201cstill under Tenkan resistance\u201d and \u201cwill probably close the week right around 20 cents, then fight another day to push through resistance later. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll get past this level on its first try.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Is \u2018One Of The Best\u2019 In Crypto\u2014$1 Remains Likely: Analyst The longer-term backdrop that keeps the feline strategist constructive is visible on the two-month chart. There, DOGE has printed what fellow technician @ManehattanStonk labels a \u201crising three methods\u201d formation\u2014a bullish continuation pattern that Cantonese Cat notes is \u201cplaying out alongside XLM.\u201d Volume dynamics appear to support the thesis: in another post the analyst calls recent selling \u201cpathetic\u201d and argues: \u201cWho&#8217;s selling DOGE? Nobody important. Sell volume&#8217;s pathetic. All it takes is just some volume to come in and this thing will pump to the moon.\u201d Whether that pump can realistically reach the 2.272 extension\u2014and thus the meme-laden target of $23\u2014is the question that triggered the thread. Cantonese Cat\u2019s answer is blunt: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to $23 this cycle.\u201d The comment underscores his broader point that Fibonacci projections, while mathematically neat, are ultimately hostage to liquidity conditions no one can forecast. The $3.94 region\u2014marked by the 1.618 Fibonacci extension\u2014stands out as a credible upside target. Analyst Kevin notes that in every previous bull cycle, Dogecoin ultimately advanced to this very extension. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.20575.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-booms-bitcoin-hyper-raises-2-5m-btc-l2-bet/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has just surpassed the $120K mark, signaling a strong return of investor confidence. As capital flows beyond Bitcoin, altcoins are seeing a sharp rise in interest. Investors are betting big on early-stage projects, in particular, for their explosive potential in bullish markets. One standout is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has already raised over $2.7M in its token presale. The project\u2019s Layer-2 infrastructure attracts attention for its capacity to make Bitcoin faster, more scalable, and more functionally competitive. The Bitcoin Rally Is On, But Functionality Still Lags The current Bitcoin rally didn\u2019t happen overnight. The bullish story has been building over the past few months, steadily supported by ETF applications from major players, crypto regulations turning positive, and changing macroeconomic sentiments. $BTC is doing what it does best. Time and again, it proves its worth as a store of value, emphasising that investors shouldn\u2019t take the broader crypto market lightly. But Bitcoin&#8217;s capabilities still fall short. Running decentralized apps or scaling transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s main chain continues to be difficult, both technically and financially. This is where Bitcoin Hyper comes in. Rather than treating Bitcoin as sacrosanct, it introduces a Layer-2 solution designed to work with the network. Not around it. What Is Bitcoin Hyper, and Why Are Investors Paying Attention? Bitcoin Hyper is building a Layer-2 blockchain for Bitcoin. The idea is simple. Let Bitcoin remain the secure foundation, while Bitcoin Hyper handles the transactions, the apps, and the ecosystem growth. Here\u2019s what the project has in the works: Scalable transactions via a dedicated Layer-2 network. $BTC deposits and withdrawals through a canonical bridge. Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration to support fast, smart contract-enabled apps. A roadmap that includes full DeFi and NFT support, developer toolkits, and DAO governance. Bitcoin Hyper is currently in Phase 2 of its roadmap, with presale prices increasing in stages. $HYPER tokens can be staked, used for gas, and will eventually unlock exclusive ecosystem features. The tokenomics leans heavily toward development and infrastructure: 30% is allocated to project development, and another 30% to the treasury. Marketing and staking rewards follow, at 25% and 5% respectively. The project has also completed two independent security audits by blockchain security firms Coinsult and Spywolf. The audits confirmed that the coin meets industry standards for reliability and investor protection. Layer-2 Projects Are on the Move and $HYPER Is Tapping In Layer-2 tokens have been making serious moves in recent weeks. $ZKF has surged 84% in the past seven days, while $MAGIC is up 46%. Other notable performers like $LUMIA and $POL have also posted strong double-digit gains, reflecting growing investor interest in scalable blockchain infrastructure. Scalability is no longer optional. It\u2019s a core part of blockchain\u2019s next chapter. And for Bitcoin, which has never been known for speed or flexibility, Layer-2 is likely the way ahead. Given current market trends, $HYPER could reach around $0.02595 by the end of 2025. And assuming the project delivers on its white paper goals (like the mainnet launch, dApp support, and top exchange listings), it might climb as high as $0.253 by 2030. That would mark a return of over 20 times the initial presale price. The above Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) price prediction isn\u2019t guaranteed, of course, but it is based on a fairly simple logic: if Bitcoin gains real utility at scale, the networks that provide it will benefit first. Why Timing Matters More Than Usual Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s token presale is structured around timed price increases. As of now, $HYPER is priced at $0.01225, with the next increase set to trigger in just a few hours. Staking APY also declines over time, encouraging early participation. The presale traffic is growing as the $BTC rally fuels interest in the broader ecosystem. This isn\u2019t just about a good idea. It\u2019s about being early to infrastructure that could play a role in how Bitcoin evolves from a static asset into something developers and users can actually build on. Final Thoughts: Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move is Layer-2 Bitcoin crossing $120K is more than just a milestone. It\u2019s a signal that markets move in phases. While early gains often go to the safest assets, the next leg is likely to reward low-cap altcoins backed by breakthrough projects. Bitcoin Hyper is one of those projects. By bringing scalability and flexibility to Bitcoin through its Layer-2 infrastructure, it positions itself not as a competitor but as a necessary evolution of what Bitcoin can offer. The strong community engagement and presale traffic that\u2019s already raised over $2.7M shows that investors are looking beyond the headline coins. If you\u2019re considering early exposure to Bitcoin Hyper, visit the official presale website to learn more about the Layer-2 infrastructure and secure $HYPER tokens before the next price increase. New to presales? Be sure to read the How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper guide, and, as always, do your own research before making any crypto investment decisions."
