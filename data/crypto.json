      "summary": "In accordance with recent statistics, Dogwifhat (WIF) jumped 24% in the past 24 hours, moving above $0.85 as Bitcoin broke above $107,000. Traders observed a quick turnaround from levels below $0.72. Active wallets handling WIF jumped by 20%, and daily volume hit over $70 million. All those actions brought the Solana meme coin to within range of the $1.00 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Network Activity Shoots Up Based on reports, the Dogwifhat network saw a jump in trading volume to over $700 million in the past two days. That level of activity is rare for a token ranked 45th by market cap at about $1.75 billion. It now sits behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but outpaces fellow Solana names like FLOKI, PEPE and BONK.

Grassroots campaigns rolled out on social media channels, fueling renewed interest. That momentum helped to maintain volume levels over $70 million a day and continued to keep wallet counts rising. Support at $0.81 held firm when the rally began, giving buyers confidence. Technical Breakout Hints At More Gains Based on chart analysis, WIF broke out of a descending wedge on the 4-hour chart. That pattern formed over the past week before prices cleared the $0.83 level on higher trading volume. The Relative Strength Index sits near 60, below overbought territory, suggesting there\u2019s still room to run. Traders now eye a move to $0.90, the next Fibonacci retracement. A push past $1.00 would be the strongest signal yet. Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities Bitcoin And Solana Link Remains Strong According to market watchers, WIF\u2019s fate is tied to Bitcoin and the wider Solana ecosystem. Maintaining Bitcoin above $105,000 will be crucial for keeping momentum. Any pullback could force WIF back toward support at $0.77 or even the recent floor at $0.71. At the same time, new exchange listings or partnership news could stoke another leg higher. Risk Management Key For Traders According to trading guides, meme coins such as WIF bear large swings. Smart traders are encouraged to place tight stops and control position sizes. A retreat below $0.80 would be a call to exercise caution. In case support fails, prices can test the lower bands once again. But if the coin holds ground, a run at $1.00 could spark fresh buying. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-surge-to-130000/",
      "summary": "After a week of volatile price action, Bitcoin has once again returned to familiar territory around the $106,000 price level. However, on-chain data shows that investors are still cautious, with the crypto Fear &#38; Greed Index now in the neutral zone. On the other hand, technical analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price action on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows that its price behavior has completed a significant correction, one that&#8217;s paving the way for a major rally to $130,000. Bitcoin\u2019s Wave 2 Correction Might Be Complete According to XForceGlobal, a crypto analyst who posted a detailed Elliott Wave chart on the social platform X, Bitcoin\u2019s recent correction fits neatly within a completed WXY pattern. The second wave, which started following the all-time high of $111,814 on May 22 and formed the corrective structure, has now retraced into the expected Fibonacci range between the 23.6% and 38.2% levels. Notably, the ideal minimum target for this correction move was in the $90,000 region, and Bitcoin fulfilled that condition with the pullback to just under $98,200 over the weekend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The most important thing was in preserving the macro wave structure. Instead of drawing out a deeper pullback into the 0.618 to 0.886 Fibonacci levels, which is often characteristic of bear market retracements, the analysis maintains the idea that this was a wave 2 correction within a larger bullish impulse. This distinction is important. If the WXY correction is indeed complete and wave 2 has concluded, the next logical move in the Elliott Wave sequence is a third wave advance. According to Elliott Wave analysis, the third wave is often the most explosive in terms of price expansion. Its outcome could therefore push the price of Bitcoin to new heights that are significantly higher than its most recent all-time high. Why $130,000 Is A Realistic Target For Bitcoin The analyst&#8217;s technical projection on Bitcoin&#8217;s 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows an expected wave 3 trajectory extending beyond $111,800, with an expansion arrow reaching up above $130,000. This is the expansion move and is based on a similar projection of Wave 1. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Move Is Over? Higher Lows Chart A Course To $115,482 In the accompanying chart, the analyst marks the key pivot zone between $98,000 and $102,000 as the Wave C termination area. If this zone indeed marks the completion of the second wave, the next movement would require validation through the formation of a clear 1-2 structure within Wave 3. This means that confirmation of the bullish count also depends on the price making a new local high above the current range and then pulling back without breaching the recent lows. If that structure plays out, then the market would likely be in the early stages of a powerful third wave. Bitcoin has already made an 8% price gain after it dropped to a low of $98,200 following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The most significant upward move came on Tuesday, June 24, when reports of a Middle East cease-fire pushed Bitcoin up roughly 4%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,330.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/global-m2-cant-predict-bitcoin-price/",
      "summary": "Sina\u2014co-founder of the hedge fund 21st Capital\u2014publicly dismantled a popular Bitcoin price model promoted by Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, calling it a textbook case of data illiteracy and overfitting. The model in question draws a close correlation between Bitcoin and Global M2\u2014a measure of global money supply\u2014by shifting M2 data forward by a set number of weeks, typically 10 to 12, to supposedly \u201cpredict\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s future price moves. Raoul Pal has used this chart to argue that macro liquidity conditions drive crypto cycles, and that the current market behavior can be forecast using monetary expansion. Expert Torches M2-Bitcoin Correlation But Sina, a trained data scientist who teaches data analytics at the undergraduate and graduate level, says this model collapses under scrutiny. \u201cThis is a terrible failure of not understanding overfitting,\u201d he said in a June 24 video posted to X. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing doesn\u2019t even pass the first month of a first-year data analytics course.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall Sina points out that the apparent correlation between Bitcoin and Global M2 only exists because the data has been \u201ctortured\u201d to fit historical patterns. \u201cIf I\u2019m allowed to play with the data and arbitrarily move things around, I can definitely find great matches between pockets of data,\u201d he said, warning that this flexibility is exactly what allows analysts to create the illusion of predictive accuracy. The primary issue, he explained, is that the Global M2 data itself is inherently flawed. It\u2019s compiled by multiplying various central banks\u2019 M2 figures by exchange rates\u2014mixing fast-reporting economies like the US with countries that have data delays of weeks or even months. This creates a misleading impression of daily fluctuations in global liquidity. \u201cIt seems to be moving on a daily basis, but it\u2019s actually mixing frequent and infrequent updates,\u201d Sina said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a true signal.\u201d More importantly, Sina argues that the model fails the moment one zooms out from selective chart slices. While Raoul Pal and others have showcased examples of tightly aligned tops and bottoms between Bitcoin and Global M2, Sina demonstrated how minor tweaks in lead time or scale can yield dramatically different outcomes. \u201cLet\u2019s try a lead of 80 days. That doesn\u2019t look good. What about 108? Ah, now the tops align\u2014so let\u2019s zoom in again and pretend it works,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cThis is not modeling. This is playing.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern\u2014Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead He highlighted how each adjustment to the model\u2014shifting from a 12-week lead to 10 weeks, to 108 days\u2014exposes its lack of systematic foundation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a proper model, you fail to predict the future,\u201d Sina said. \u201cThis is classic overfitting. You force the data to match historical behavior, but you lose any generalizability.\u201d To illustrate the concept, Sina compared it to fitting a curve through a noisy sine wave. A well-structured model captures the core pattern and ignores noise. An overfit model, by contrast, attempts to match every small fluctuation\u2014resulting in poor predictive performance when new data arrives. \u201cOverfitting looks better, but it models noise. And noise doesn\u2019t repeat,\u201d he said. Sina also questioned whether Bitcoin might actually lead liquidity, not follow it. \u201cIf you look at the last cycle, Bitcoin topped first. Liquidity topped 145 days later,\u201d he said. This reverses the causality implied by the Global M2 model and calls into question its entire premise as a forward-looking tool. His conclusion was blunt: \u201cYou have to be very careful with overfitting. It looks matching, but it\u2019s forcibly fit on historical data. You have no idea about the predictive accuracy of this thing.\u201d At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,952. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/chainlink-news/chainlink-reclaims-key-structure-quiet-accumulation-could-fuel-25-30-surge/",
      "summary": "Chainlink (LINK) is up 21% from its Sunday lows, gaining momentum in an otherwise uncertain macro and geopolitical environment. While global tensions continue to spark volatility across markets, Chainlink has stood out for its resilience, supported by a series of strong partnerships and growing on-chain fundamentals. The recent price action signals a potential shift in trend, but analysts warn that a confirmed breakout is still needed before bulls can fully take over. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply Top analyst Henry Lord of Alts highlighted that LINK has endured months of persistent downtrend and unusually quiet price behavior. However, recent moves suggest that something is changing beneath the surface. Volume is increasing, volatility is picking up, and LINK is forming a base structure that could mark the end of its accumulation phase. Despite this strength, Chainlink remains technically locked within a consolidation range. A clean breakout above key resistance levels will be critical to trigger the next phase of upward momentum. Until then, traders are cautiously optimistic as LINK teases a larger move. Chainlink Prepares For A Decisive Move Chainlink is currently trading over 25% below its May high, reflecting the broader market impact of rising macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, especially the recent Middle East conflicts. Despite these pressures, LINK has managed to hold within a steady consolidation range, signaling resilience as the crypto market awaits its next decisive move. Maintaining prices above current levels is crucial. A breakdown here could open the door for deeper corrections. However, analyst Henry believes the tides may be turning. According to Henry, Chainlink has endured months of downtrend and silence, but a structural shift is now underway. His analysis highlights that the long-standing downtrend has been broken, and LINK has entered a clear accumulation and consolidation phase. \u201cThese zones often come before the loudest moves,\u201d Henry notes. Historically, such phases have preceded explosive rallies, and this time may be no different. If momentum picks up, a breakout toward the $25\u2013$30 range wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Henry also points out that periods of inactivity often mask the actions of smart money\u2014buying quietly before the broader market catches on. While it\u2019s easy to overlook assets during calm phases, that\u2019s often when the groundwork for major moves is laid. For now, Chainlink remains on watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month LINK Price Analysis: Signs of Reversal Emerge Chainlink is showing early signs of a trend reversal after months of consistent decline. As seen in the 12-hour chart, LINK recently rebounded from the $11.50 level and is now trading above $13.20. This recovery follows a steep drop that marked a new local low, but the bounce has pushed the price above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), now acting as short-term support at $13.50. Importantly, LINK is now testing the 100-day SMA (around $14.65), which previously served as resistance in late May and early June. If bulls manage to break and consolidate above this level, the next target lies near the 200-day SMA at $14.16\u2014a confluence zone that may act as a critical decision point for trend continuation or rejection. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support \u2013 $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move While the macro structure remains bearish, this short-term accumulation range suggests growing demand, especially as the price begins to form higher lows.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-could-rally-to-110000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price surge above $106,000 this week has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with analysts suggesting that the stars are aligning for a rally to a new all-time high. From shifting geopolitical tensions to a major regulatory pivot in the United States (US), multiple macroeconomic factors appear to be setting the stage for Bitcoin\u2019s next explosive move. Ceasefire And Rate Cut Buzz Fuel Bitcoin Price Optimism Over the weekend, the Bitcoin price briefly slipped, triggering over $200 million in leveraged long liquidations. However, this dip proved short-lived as the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded swiftly above $100,000 following US President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a total ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This sudden de-escalation helped ease global market anxiety, pushing Bitcoin past $106,000 and oil prices sharply down from $77 to under $70. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters \u2018New Era\u2019 Simultaneously, Optimism is building that the US Federal Reserve (FED) could begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Sharing new data by CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, crypto analyst CW disclosed that the odds of a FED rate cut have increased to 18.6% by July 30 during the scheduled FOMC meeting. The report reveals that 81.4% of market participants believe the FED to keep rates unchanged at their current level. However, FedWatch\u2019s data indicates growing expectations for a rate cut by the September FOMC meeting, with 79% betting on a reduction and only 21.3% anticipating no change. Notably, lower interest rates generally benefit risk assets like Bitcoin by increasing liquidity and boosting investor sentiment. With geopolitical tensions easing and a possibly looser monetary policy on the horizon, Bitcoin could gain further momentum, potentially climbing to $110,000. Supporting this bullish forecast, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for a rally toward a new ATH of $110,000 following its recent reclaim of the key $103,500 level. Although a retracement to around $102,500 remains possible, Bennett believes that once BTC cleans up support around $103,400, formed during Monday\u2019s expansion, the next move could be parabolic. Regulatory Win Solidify Bitcoin\u2019s Position In TradFi Beyond anticipated rate cuts and ceasefire announcements, the US FED recently made a landmark policy shift that could have profound long-term implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. By removing \u201creputational risk\u201d as a factor in evaluating crypto firms\u2019 access to bank servicing, the FED is effectively ending a key pillar of Operation Checkpoint 2.0\u2014a campaign that restricted over 30 crypto and fintech companies from traditional financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Deviates From Global M2 Money Supply, Is The Bull Run Over? This recent change clears the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have also followed suit, green-lighting crypto activities for banks and allowing them to participate in the digital assets market without prior approval. Together, these moves mark a regulatory pivot that not only legitimizes the crypto industry but could also accelerate demand and capital inflows into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its already significant valuation.
