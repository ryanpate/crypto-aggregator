      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-make-or-break-moment-this-month/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin is changing hands near $0.198 on Wednesday afternoon in Europe, almost 20 % below its late-March high yet still clinging to an eleven-month up-trend that now converges with a formidable technical inflection, according to independent analyst \u201cVisionPulsed.\u201d Is This Dogecoin\u2019s Summer Liftoff? Speaking in a 10 June video, the analyst told viewers he had been \u201cmaking the case that the first two weeks of June should be when we start moving up\u2014if we\u2019re bullish. He conceded that \u201cthere is a chance the move has started\u201d after Dogecoin closed a two-day candle back above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement drawn from the December 2024 swing high. The backdrop VisionPulsed describes is notably risk-on. Bitcoin is hovering around $109,500, roughly 3% shy of its all-time high, while Ethereum has punched out a fresh twelve-month high above $2,790. In equities, the S&#38;P Small-Cap 600\u2014an index the analyst referenced when he quipped that \u201cthe S&#38;P broke 600 yesterday\u201d\u2014posted its strongest five-day advance since March, a move the analyst interprets as validation of a global-liquidity gauge Global M2. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Hash-ribbon signals on Bitcoin flipped positive two weeks ago, the analyst noted, historically an early marker of revived demand for risk assets. \u201cBitcoin at 110K says we should go up. Ethereum breaking out says we should go up. If we still don\u2019t go up\u2026 just pick a different investment choice.\u201d Central to VisionPulsed\u2019s thesis is a 70-day cyclical window counted from Dogecoin\u2019s April 1 local low. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching that 70-day mark.\u2026 It is now the time for it to be bullish,\u201d he said, warning that failure to rally before mid-June would all but invalidate the setup. Yet the analyst concedes that Dogecoin\u2019s fate is tethered to the ETH/BTC pair and to Bitcoin dominance, which has remained stubbornly elevated: \u201cWhen the ETH-BTC move does occur, that\u2019s going to be when the dominance falls and we need the dominance to fall because that\u2019s when Dogecoin goes to the moon.\u201d Until that rotation happens, any up-ticks in DOGE may remain prone to stalling beneath long-term resistance. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive VisionPulsed identifies three price milestones that will decide sentiment. A daily close above $0.23 would constitute the first clear break of the descending trend-line in place since December, while $0.30\u2014the 0.618 retracement of the entire 2021\u20132024 bear market\u2014marks the level at which, he says, \u201cpeople will start talking about Dogecoin at your summer camp\u2026 it\u2019s going to be euphoric.\u201d Should time drag on, he allows that the trigger could slide to $0.27, but the message is stark: \u201cIf we just shoot up, it\u2019s still $0.30. If we take longer, it could be lower, but it\u2019s the same concept.\u201d With Bitcoin firm above six figures, Ethereum printing new local highs, and global liquidity gauges flashing green, the stage is set for an upside resolution. Whether Dogecoin can convert that macro tail-wind into a decisive break above $0.23\u2014and ignite the $0.30 euphoria line\u2014will become evident within the next fortnight. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.197. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solaxy-coming-to-ethereum-with-hyperlane-soon-to-reach-48m-in-presale/",
      "summary": "Solaxy ($SOLX), Solana&#8217;s newest and most faithful project yet, has come out with its latest update that could change the way Web3 apps and tokens interact across blockchains. The project announced its collaboration with Hyperlane, a Web3 infrastructure project, to make bridging faster, easier, and more seamless than it&#8217;s ever been. Keep reading to learn more about Solaxy&#8217;s Hyperlane announcement, what it means for Solana and altcoin enthusiasts, and why it could benefit the Solaxy presale and help it achieve the magical $50M mark. Solaxy Revolutionizes Cross-Chain Support with New Hyperlane Integration It&#8217;s worth noting that traditional bridging, which means transferring tokens from one blockchain to another, is a slow and complex process. That&#8217;s where Solaxy begs to differ, though. With Hyperlane&#8217;s cutting-edge modular and permissionless architecture, Solaxy will build an entirely new type of bridge that connects Solana, Solaxy, and Ethereum flawlessly. This will be a first-of-its-kind Layer 2 bridge experience for Solana users, providing low latency (better speeds), improved affordability, and enhanced user experience. For developers and users on Solana, transferring tokens between the two blockchains would be as easy as using a regular app. Solaxy Aims to Help Solana Grow Bigger and Better Solana&#8217;s development is Solaxy&#8217;s core mission. That&#8217;s what this new crypto with an Einstein-ified Pepe the Frog as its face card is all about, in fact. $SOLX&#8217;s Hyperlane integration will help Solana plug directly into Ethereum, a blockchain with deep liquidity and a vast dApp ecosystem, helping it grow beyond its limitations (solving issues like limited scalability and network congestion). The launch of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens earlier this year brought in a flurry of new investors to Solana. But, despite being a meme coin-friendly blockchain, it wasn&#8217;t prepared for the sudden spike in transaction requests. Which led to numerous failed transactions and massive congestion. Solaxy plans to remedy that, however, by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. It will bring back the network&#8217;s glory days by increasing its efficiency and scaling it to higher levels. The project will offload a significant number of transactions onto a sidechain (L2) through its roll-up technology, easing the pressure off Solana&#8217;s L1. The L2 will also implement batch processing, executing transactions in bulk, instead of one by one. This will reduce the cost per transaction, making Solana an ever more affordable blockchain for crypto and meme coin degens. By bridging to Ethereum and Solana using Hyperlane, Solaxy becomes more than just a scaling tool. It&#8217;s a full-blown interoperable hub, allowing seamless crypto transfers between the most popular blockchains in the world. One Multi-Chain Token, Several Use Cases Thanks to its compatibility with multiple chains (Solana and Ethereum), Solaxy&#8217;s scalability and speed can be used to power high-frequency dApps, too. These include: Gaming ecosystems looking for real-time interactions Meme coin and microtransaction platforms Custom-built financial applications that need low latency and improved affordability And consider the fact that Ethereum is the second-most popular blockchain for dApps after BNB, with over 5K dApps live right now (10x more than Solana). Which brings us to the kicker: Solaxy&#8217;s Hyperlane bridging between its blockchain, Solana, and Ethereum, could be much more impactful than at first glance. $SOLX, as Solaxy&#8217;s token, should receive much much of this boost and keep growing at an accelerated rate as a result. Solaxy&#8217;s Record-Breaking Presale Performance As Solaxy&#8217;s real-world application keeps growing, $SOLX investors should receive the lion&#8217;s share of the benefits. $SOLX is currently in presale, having already raised an eye-watering $47.1M in early investor funding. Each token is currently priced at just $0.001752, and given Solaxy&#8217;s wild future potential \u2013 it could explode 11,300% and reach $0.20 by 2026 \u2013 this is an almost unbelievably good deal you&#8217;re getting on Solaxy right now. If you&#8217;re interested in supporting the next big thing in DeFi, visit the official Solaxy website, connect your crypto wallet, punch in the number of tokens you want to buy, and confirm the transaction from your wallet. It&#8217;s all so simple! For further help, check out our full explainer on how to buy Solaxy. Disclaimer: A crypto token&#8217;s potential notwithstanding, kindly bear in mind that the market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-repeat-bitcoin-2021/",
      "summary": "With the recent Ethereum price trend, a crypto analyst has pointed out that the altcoin could be looking to stage a similar rally to what was seen with Bitcoin back in 2021. Crypto analyst TradingShot pointed out the similarities in a recent analysis and showing where the price could go if it does play out the same way. Ethereum Looks Like Bitcoin Did In 2021 In the analysis posted on TradingView, crypto analyst TradingShot showed how this Ethereum cycle movement looked similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 cycle movement. The first of this was recovery from a major price crash that led to new cycle lows for the cryptocurrency, before staging a recovery that pushed it toward new highs. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Still Coming? Why Bitcoin Is To Blame Despite Making ATHs For Bitcoin, the crash happened when the COVID-19 lockdown was announced. Following this, the Bitcoin price had fallen more than 50% from above $9,000 to less than $4,000 in less than one month. However, after this, the Bitcoin price rebounded from the cycle lows, crossing the 1-week MA50, and then breaking the lower high trendline, and going on to reach new all-time highs. For Ethereum, the crypto analyst pointed to the price crash triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s tariff wars as being similar to Bitcoin\u2019s COVID crash. After Donald Trump announced tariffs on other countries, the Ethereum price also crashed by a large margin, going from above $2,400 to below $1,500 in less than a month. This has been dubbed the \u2018Trade War Crash\u2019, and the altcoin is still reeling from the decline. Currently, the Ethereum price is stuck at the point where it is still trying to break above the 1-week MA50, which is now the major level to beat to confirm this trend. Just like Bitcoin, it has also seen the formation of major resistance at the lower highs, and this sits right at the $4,200 level. This means the Ethereum price still has around a 50% rally to complete before it confirms a similar trend to Bitcoin. How High ETH Price Could Go If It Plays Out If Ethereum does reclaim the 1W 50MA and then breaks the lower highs at $4,200, confirming this trend, then the resulting rally could be exceptional. For example, after breaking the lower highs, the Bitcoin price went on to reach new all-time highs of $69,000 in 2021. This means that the price went from below $4,000 to $69,000 in the space of a year. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric A similar rally would mean that the Ethereum price would rise above $10,000. Taking the same timelines into position, it would put ETH at this price sometime in 2026, a year from when the Trade Wars crash had occurred. A closer parabolic rally and an imitation of Bitcoin\u2019s 1,700% rally would mean a price tag above $15,000 for the second-largest cryptocurrency in the space.

      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to reclaim a crucial area amid its recent price recovery, which could propel the flagship crypto toward new highs. Some analysts suggested that BTC is preparing for the \u201cfinal resistance,\u201d while others warned that it still risks a potential pullback to lower levels. Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 \u2013 Is A Recovery Around The Corner? Bitcoin Rally Eyes Next Resistance Bitcoin has finally regained significant bullish momentum after printing a massive daily candle on Monday. The flagship crypto recently lost its post-all-time high (ATH) range of $106,800-$109,700, sparking concern among some investors. Amid the recent market pullbacks, which began in late May, the flagship crypto also registered some volatility, losing key levels as support and hitting a one-month low near the $100,000 level last week. However, BTC reclaimed the $105,000 mark over the weekend before surging above the $106,800 crucial resistance on Monday. Following this performance, analyst Rekt Capital stated that Bitcoin has successfully retested the $104,400 re-accumulation range high resistance as new support for four weeks. He highlighted that BTC was \u201crebounding from this new support base in an effort to transition into Price Discovery again.\u201d Additionally, Bitcoin ended its two-week downtrend, recording a Daily Close around the $110,500 area. Per the analyst, BTC \u201chas skipped through the $106,600-$109,443 Daily Range entirely,\u201d and is \u201conce again positioning itself like in late May for a retest\u201d of the range\u2019s high as support, which propelled the price to its ATH last month. A daily close above the $109,443 level would set up BTC for a revisit of the \u201cfinal Daily resistance,\u201d around the $111,723 mark, before a new ATH. The analyst also affirmed that reclaiming the \u201cfinal weekly resistance\u201d of $108,900 as support would also add to BTC\u2019s momentum. BTC In A &#8216;Dangerous Area&#8217;? Analyst Crypto Jelle suggested that turning the $108,000 price area into support could send Bitcoin to the price discovery phase, potentially targeting the $120,000 mark. He noted that previous unsuccessful breakout attempts failed to reclaim this level, but that the cryptocurrency is currently holding this area. Based on a multi-month pattern, Jelle also reaffirmed its $140,000-$150,000 target for BTC\u2019s cycle top. The analyst highlighted a major inverted Head and Shoulders pattern forming since the end of 2024. According to"

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the veterans of the Bitcoin market are taking 89% less profits compared to the May peak, despite prices being similar now. Bitcoin Realized Profit For 1Y+ Hands Is Relatively Low Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Realized Profit of the seasoned hands on the Bitcoin network. The &#8220;Realized Profit&#8221; refers to an indicator that measures, as its name implies, the amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being transacted or &#8216;sold&#8217; on the chain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If the previous selling value is less than the current price for any token, then that particular token&#8217;s sale is contributing to profit realization. Related Reading: Toncoin Heading Toward 40% Breakout, Pattern Could Suggest The amount of profit realized in the sale is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this value for all tokens being transferred to find the total for the network as a whole. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Profit of the entire userbase isn&#8217;t of interest, but just that of a specific part of it: the 1+ year holders. These are the investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than a year, without having involved them in a transaction even once. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their tokens, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, this part of the userbase with its significant holding time would include the resolute diamond hands of the market. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit for these HODLers over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit of the 1+ year investors observed a huge spike in late May. This sharp profit-taking spree from these seasoned hands came as BTC surged to $110,000 following its post all-time high (ATH) pullback. Shortly after the selloff from this cohort, BTC started on a decline. During the past day, though, the asset has appeared to have finally shoved off this bearish momentum, as it has once more returned above the $109,000 mark. This time, however, there hasn&#8217;t been any significant reaction from the diamond hands. Currently, the 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) of the group&#8217;s Realized Profit sits at $13.6 million, which is 89% down compared to the $126 million peak from last month.
