      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/chartist-slams-misleading-dogecoin-analysis/",
      "summary": "Technical analyst Kevin, better known on X as @Kev_Capital_TA, rekindled debate over Dogecoin\u2019s market structure on Sunday when he urged traders to ignore the \u201cnon-stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes\u201d and to concentrate on the two signals that have guided the meme-coin\u2019s price for more than two years. \u201cNot much has changed for Dogecoin here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t let the other analysts on this platform flood you with non stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes. We know what to watch for here.\u201d Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Kevin\u2019s view hinges on the weekly chart he posted on 26 June. At that time, Dogecoin (DOGE) was hovering near $0.166\u2014and, according to his chart, sitting directly on an ascending support cluster that has defined every major move since the 2022 bear-market washout. \u201cLooking at Dogecoin on the weekly time frame,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can see that ever since the bear market breakout on the weekly RSI back in 2022, any time DOGE has hit that level again\u2014which has happened five times now\u2014Doge has gone on to see major bounces. A failure of this weekly RSI level along with a failure of the $0.143-$0.127 level would be the line in the sand between longer term bearish price action or continued bull.\u201d Related Reading: The $1 Dogecoin Dream Is Alive: Chartist Lays Out Parabolic Scenario The chart shows Dogecoin sitting just millimetres above a confluence of the green 0.382 Fibonacci retracement ($0.13778), the upper boundary of a falling trend line that has been in force since May 2021 and the weekly 200 SMA and EMA. Previously, Kevin stated via X: \u201cWeekly 200 SMA and EMA are must holds for Dogecoin along with the macro .382 and down trending support.\u201d Beneath lies the horizontal \u201cline in the sand\u201d at $0.143-$0.127\u2014a zone Kevin has ring-fenced with bold yellow trend lines. Below the price pane, the weekly Relative Strength Index tells an equally focused story. Kevin has drawn a white band just above the 40-line; the yellow RSI profile has now tapped that band five times. Each tag coincided with a price trough circled in orange on the main chart. The oscillator\u2019s simple moving average (plotted in magenta) has curled below 50 but remains above the 40-support, keeping the pattern intact. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst\u2014Here\u2019s The Target Overhead, Kevin\u2019s chart maps a hierarchy of Fibonacci checkpoints: the 0.5 retracement at $0.18988 (red), the tightly stacked 0.618 ($0.26169) and 0.65 ($0.28548) (yellow), and the 0.786 ($0.41317) (blue). Two large violet supply boxes\u2014one between $1.00 and $1.30 and another around $2.20 and $2.70\u2014represent possible bull run targets. Kevin refrains from forecasting how quickly those zones might come into play, emphasising instead that holding the current support cluster is the single prerequisite for any higher-time-frame bullish thesis. The analyst also zoomed out to the broader digital-asset landscape in a Sunday follow-up. \u201cThe biggest moves for #Altcoins have yet to occur,\u201d he argued, tying potential break-outs to macro-economic easing. \u201cIf the macro leads us to further easing and the market sniffs that out \u2026 then the ingredients will be in place for a massive move higher on Alts. Altcoins have always required the proper ingredients to make a sustained out-performance over #BTC for months. We\u2019re closer than many understand; we just need a few more things to fall into place.\u201d For now, Kevin\u2019s message is stripped to its essentials: watch the weekly RSI band and the $0.143-$0.127 price shelf. As long as both survive, the chartist sees no reason to overhaul his structural bias\u2014no matter how crowded the Dogecoin commentary stream becomes. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.172.

      "title": "XRP Price Risks Breakdown To Next Support Level, Why $2.28 Is Important",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-risks-breakdown/",
      "summary": "The XRP price has been holding on pretty tightly to its support level above $2.2 and continues to be a major level of pushback for the bears. This has shown that buyers are beginning to make a comeback at this level amid predictions that it will be the bounce point for the next rally. Regardless of this, a crypto analyst still believes that this support remains at risk as bears continue to push down on the price, and the result could be a major price crash from here. XRP Price Could Stage A Classic Bear Trap While there has been some recovery in the crypto market and, by extension, the XRP price, there has not been enough momentum to show that this is a sustained increase. This is something that crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise alludes to in their latest analysis, warning that it is possible that the digital asset might end up seeing a classic bear trap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The reason behind this is the fact that there have been a number of bearish developments on the XRP price chart that suggest that the price is likely to go down. For one, a Change of Character toward the more bearish side puts sellers in the lead, and this usually signals the start of a bearish downturn. Another development that has rocked the altcoin is an inverse Cup and Handle pattern that is still in the process of playing out. The crypto analyst also explained that these developments, in addition to the break below the key support trendline, suggest that a crash is coming for the XRP price. From here, bears are already applying pressure that could result in a 10% crash. This would push the cryptocurrency back toward the previous support, and according to the analyst\u2019s chart, this lies just above the $2 level. What this means is that a crash from here also puts the altcoin at risk of falling below $2, something that would be incredibly bearish and could lead to freefall. Wait For Confirmation Before Moving MyCryptoParadise outlined that the best way to play this analysis is to wait for confirmation. With the bearish thesis, they explain that it is best to wait for the XRP price to see a \u201cproper pullback\u201d before they enter the market. This would increase the risk-to-reward ratio after the trend direction has been confirmed. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen However, there is also the possibility that the XRP price does not crash from here and that lies at the $2.28 level. The analyst explained that if the price is able to cleanly break above this level and make a successful close above $2.28, then it would invalidate the bearish thesis and mark a continuation of the uptrend. \u201cIn such a case, it&#8217;s better to stay patient and wait for clearer price action before making any decisions,\u201d the analyst said.
