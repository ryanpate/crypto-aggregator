      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-wave-count-1800/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is still struggling below $3,000 despite the Bitcoin price sitting close to all-time highs. At the current levels, Ethereum continues to look incredibly bearish, with sell-offs dominating the market at this level. While piling shorts are pointing to a possible relief rally, there is also the possibility that the price will crash back down from here. Crypto analyst Weslad maps out the ETH price trajectory using the ABCDE wave structure, showing a possible crash below $2,000. The Bullish Ethereum Scenario Weslad points to the 2021 Ethereum peak when the price reached $4,851 as the point when a large-scale symmetrical pennant had formed for the digital asset. Interestingly, this has continued for multiple years already, and continues to play out even in 2025, four years later. So far, the analyst believes that the altcoin has been in a long-term accumulation phase in a defined corrective range. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says Another important development is the formation of an ABCDE wave pattern. This pattern often predicts peaks and troughs, and depending on where the asset is in the pattern, it could point to a recovery or a crash. Presently, the crypto analyst puts the Ethereum price as being somewhere in a D wave, which is still bullish for the price. \u201cCurrently, price action is developing near point D, approaching the upper boundary of the pennant, a crucial area that could define the next directional move,\u201d the analyst said. If this D wave plays out as expected, then the Ethereum price is expected to actually surge from here. The top of this pattern would put it above $3,500 before the move is completed. On the upper end of this is the formation of an Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern. This pattern has seen the $2,855 acting as key resistance, beating the Ethereum price down multiple times this year. However, if a sustained break is achieved above this level, in conjunction with a breakout from Wave D, then it is possible that the price does rally to new all-time highs above $6,000. The Bearish Scenario While the formation of the ABCDE wave count points to some bullishness for the Ethereum price, there is still the possibility that the price could go in the opposite direction. For example, after the D wave is completed, comes the next wave in the sequence, which is the E wave, and this is a bearish wave. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says As the crypto analyst explains, a temporary rejection at the neckline or pennant resistance would trigger an E wave retracement. In this case, the Ethereum price could see an over 30% crash, putting it back toward the $1,400-$1,800 level, where there is the most support. \u201cRecent price behavior shows compressed volatility and increased buying interest on dips, reinforcing the possibility of an imminent directional breakout,\u201d Weslad warned. \u201cA decisive move outside this macro structure may mark the beginning of a new phase of long-term price expansion.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "As the market sees a Friday retrace, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim a crucial area as support. An analyst suggests that the flagship crypto\u2019s daily close could set the stage for a bullish end of the week despite potential volatility. Related Reading: SUI Prepares For Bullish Flag Breakout Amid $3 Reclaim \u2013 Analyst Doubles The Target Bitcoin Breakout To Come \u2018Sooner Or Later\u2019 At the start of the new quarter, Bitcoin has retested crucial levels, touching the $105,000 support and $110,000 resistance over the past four days. Amid its Tuesday pullback, the flagship crypto fell to a two-week low but managed to bounce from a crucial range. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems previously noted that BTC needed a strong rebound from the \u201cmost important\u201d support and resistance area, between the $104,000 and $106,000 price levels, explaining that failing to hold this range would open the door for a drop to the range lows around $101,000. On Friday, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s price action after holding the key levels, which \u201cprovided the perfect entry for a bounce, just as expected.\u201d Following this performance, he asserted that Bitcoin is expanding on its two-month Power of Three (Po3) setup, signaling that potential further expansion is ahead. Nonetheless, he pointed out that the flagship crypto is still trading in a two-month range, suggesting a volatile price action until the price successfully breaks out, which it has attempted to do earlier this week. \u201cSince we are in a range, we are forced to respect the key levels of the range: high, mid, and low,\u201d Sjuul detailed, adding that all eyes are currently on the mid-range, where bulls must step in to confirm the bullish move to the range high. Based on this, the analyst forecasted another move above the $110,00 mark, where \u201cwe have left a lot of unfinished business\u201d and \u201cplenty of liquidity lies.\u201d He pointed to a huge cluster near the $111,000 area in BTC\u2019s Liquidity Heatmap, affirming that \u201cprice is attracted by liquidity, so I am expecting that level to be visited sooner or later.\u201d BTC Eyes Pivotal Closes After being rejected from the $108,000 at the start of the week, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin broke out of two 2-week downtrends in the past 40 days but was rejected from the crucial 6-week diagonal downtrend, around the $108,000 mark, during the same timeframe. This week, BTC closed above this resistance twice, and daily closed above the $109,000 mark on Thursday. However, Friday\u2019s pullback saw Bitcoin drop below the crucial level, falling to the $107,245 area. The analyst considers that a key retest of the pattern is in progress. He previously explained that any dipping into the top of Bitcoin\u2019s pattern could \u201ctechnically be considered additional retesting to further solidify the recently broken black diagonal resistance into new support.\u201d Nonetheless, BTC must close today above the diagonal resistance for a successful retest. \u201cBitcoin is losing the diagonal for the moment. But if price Daily Closes above the diagonal, then this will have ended as a downside wick as part of a volatile retest. Upcoming Daily Close will be pivotal,\u201d he stated. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 \u2013 Here Are The Levels To Watch Meanwhile, Bitcoin is also on the cusp of making history as its price nears the \u201cfinal major Weekly resistance\u201d around the $109,000. Rekt Capital detailed that if BTC closes above this level, it would confirm a break from this major resistance, which would likely unlock a new all-time high (ATH). He concluded that, with the recent weekend volatility, \u201cwe won&#8217;t know until the very last moment heading into the new Weekly Close whether this level has been flipped into support or not.\u201d Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "On-chain data shows Shiba Inu (SHIB) has its supply more concentrated on the largest holders than other assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Pepe (PEPE). Shiba Inu Has 62% Of Its Supply Controlled By Top 10 Whales In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how some top coins currently compare against each other in terms of the percentage of supply held by the ten largest wallets on the respective networks. Below is a chart showing the trend in this metric for eight cryptocurrencies: Shiba Inu, Ethereum, Pepe, USDT, USDC, DAI, Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI). As is visible in the graph, the stablecoin USDC has the lowest amount of supply concentrated on the top 10 addresses among these assets at around 27%. Chainlink and DAI come close with the metric sitting at 32% and 33%, respectively. Others like Uniswap and Ethereum, however, have a more significant part of their supply under the control of these humongous entities: 51% and 49%, respectively. One asset that particularly stands out is Shiba Inu, with a massive 62% of its supply belonging to the ten largest whales on the network. For comparison, the other memecoin on the list, Pepe, has the same metric at 39%. Generally, the centralization of supply on just a few hands isn&#8217;t a constructive sign for any cryptocurrency&#8217;s stability, as tokens signify power on the network. It&#8217;s especially relevant in the case of a proof-of-stake (PoS) asset like Ethereum. As Santiment explains, As a retail trader, it&#8217;s generally safer to hold coins with less supply held by the most elite whales. There is less risk of sudden dumps or price manipulation should an asset&#8217;s largest whales decide to exit their positions. Given this, the assets like Ethereum, Uniswap, and Shiba Inu that currently have a majority of their supply or close to it in the hands of the top 10 whales may not be in the best position right now. In some other news, the cryptocurrency market sentiment is on the verge of extreme greed, according to the Fear &#38; Greed Index. The Fear &#38; Greed Index is an indicator created by Alternative that inputs a few different factors to determine the investor mentality as a score lying between zero and hundred. As displayed above, the cryptocurrency Fear &#38; Greed has a value of 73 at the moment. This corresponds to the presence of a strong sentiment of greed present among the traders. Historically, markets have often moved in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd. The probability of a contrary move is especially strong in the extreme ends of the index. For now, the market is still outside of the extreme greed zone, but only by a couple of units. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000115, up over 3% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, Alternative.me, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) is up 4.2% over the past seven days, trading in the mid-$2,500 range at the time of writing. Although the digital asset remains down 19% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, some analysts are optimistic that it\u2019s ready for a liftoff. Ethereum Enters Wyckoff \u2018Liftoff\u2019 Phase In an X post published today, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum appears to be following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern and has successfully cleared both the \u2018creek\u2019 and \u2018spring\u2019 phases, potentially entering the \u2018liftoff\u2019 phase characterized by parabolic price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge In the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, the \u2018creek\u2019 represents overhead resistance where price struggles to break higher, while the \u2018spring\u2019 is a false breakdown below support, meant to trap bears and confirm strong hands. The \u2018liftoff\u2019 phase follows the spring, marked by a sharp recovery and breakout above resistance, signaling the start of a new bullish trend. The analyst shared the following Ethereum daily chart, which shows the cryptocurrency on the verge of a potential breakout, with its next major resistance at the $3,700 level. A successful breakout and retest of this level could set the stage for a new all-time high (ATH). Fellow crypto analyst Crypto GEMs also pointed toward Ethereum getting ready for a significant move to the upside. The analyst shared the following chart which compares ETH\u2019s price action in 2025 to that in 2024. If Ethereum mirrors its 2024 performance, it could break above the $3,000 mark in the near term. However, not all analysts share this bullish outlook. For instance, noted crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a four-hour Ethereum chart showing the asset trading within a rising wedge pattern. He cautioned that unless ETH breaks out of this formation, it may face a drop to $2,200. To explain, a rising wedge pattern is a bearish chart formation where price moves upward within converging trendlines, indicating weakening bullish momentum. It often signals an upcoming breakdown, as buyers lose control and sellers push the price lower after the wedge is breached. ETH Network Sees Renewed Activity In a separate X post, crypto analyst CryptoGoos remarked that daily transactions on Ethereum are nearing ATH level for the first time since 2021. Typically, heightened network activity tends to precede major price movements. Analyst Crypto Rover echoed this view, noting that active addresses across the Ethereum network have hit a new all-time high. They added that ETH below $3,000 is &#8220;an absolute steal.&#8221; Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross On Daily Chart \u2013 Is A New ATH Within Reach?

      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s price action caught traders\u2019 attention this week. After dipping toward the $0.13\u2013$0.15 demand zone, the meme\u2011coin shot higher, and a surge in derivatives data suggests many expect more gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming Trader Interest Climbs Around $0.19 Resistance According to market data, Open Interest jumped by 16% to reach over $2 billion. Options volume exploded by 400%. That kind of rise often points to big bets on upward swings. Right now, many eyes are on the $0.20 resistance level. If DOGE can close a daily candle above that line, it may clear the way toward $0.27. Dogecoin\u2019s technical setup is drawing fresh looks from chart watchers. The Stochastic RSI crossed above 80, which can mark an overbought zone. Yet coins have stayed above overbought readings before when buyers kept pushing. Traders will want to see real volume behind any move above that descending trendline near $0.19. Without it, the rally may stall or give back gains. Whales Return With Spot Inflows Based on reports, Dogecoin saw a net inflow of $8.20 million into spot wallets. That marks a big shift after weeks of outflows. Large holders have been moving coins onto exchanges in the past, but now they\u2019re pulling more in. In other cycles, fresh whale buys have lined up with mid\u2011term rallies. On\u2011chain metrics add another layer. Dogecoin\u2019s MVRV Z\u2011score climbed back to 0.355 after hitting near\u2011historical lows late in June. That figure measures how much profit holders stand to make on average. A rising score hints that fewer holders are underwater, and that might draw in new buyers. Still, MVRV is backward\u2011looking. It can\u2019t predict if price will break through key resistance. Network Activity Shows Mixed Signals Network stats tell a mixed story. Daily active addresses slid to 34 K, and transaction counts dropped to 15K as of July 3. That\u2019s a sharp fall from the more than 500K addresses and transactions seen in the last week of June. Lower usage could sap the rally\u2019s legs if retail traders don\u2019t reengage soon. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Even with these mixed signals, the mood toward Dogecoin is brighter than it was a week ago. Traders piling into options and hikes in Open Interest show speculative appetite is up. Large spot inflows show that whales have stepped back in. But network usage is lagging.
