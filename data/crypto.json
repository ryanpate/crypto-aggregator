      "summary": "The Dogecoin weekly structure is once again the talk of Crypto-Twitter after pseudonymous technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) published a logarithmic Fibonacci road-map for the meme-coin\u2019s fourth bull cycle. The chart, built on TradingView and shared on 13 July, anchors the entire 2021\u20132022 range and projects both horizontal retracement levels and upward-sloping Fib-channels, offering a granular set of targets. Dogecoin To $23? At Friday\u2019s close DOGE changed hands near $0.20, almost exactly against the 0.5 retracement line, highlighted on the graphic at $0.19049. The overlay shows price compressing inside a three-year ascending channel whose lower rail has provided support since the June 2022 capitulation. Volatility has been fading inside that corridor, shaping a broadening wedge that has so far respected every golden-ratio diagonal printed on the chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It\u2019s No Meme Cantonese Cat\u2019s horizontal grid begins with the cycle floor\u2014Fib 0 at $0.04909\u2014and climbs through a dense cluster of intermediate resistances: 0.618 at $0.26232, 0.707 at roughly $0.33, 0.786 at $0.41368 and 0.886 at $0.54253. The 1.0 line\u2014Dogecoin\u2019s May 2021 macro-top\u2014is fixed at $0.73905 and forms the upper boundary of what the analyst calls \u201cthe first liquidity wall.\u201d Above it, blue extensions extend far beyond previous cycle extremes: 1.272 at $1.54518, 1.414 at $2.27089 and 1.618 at $3.94842. Super-cycle projections appear at 2.0 ($11.12397) and the headline-grabbing 2.272 extension at $23.25744\u2014levels the trader himself stresses are \u201cpurely imaginative unless unprecedented liquidity flows in.\u201d Golden channels running diagonally across the whole canvas translate the same ratios into time-adjusted dynamic support and resistance. Internal rails marked 0.236 and 0.382 have repeatedly capped minor rallies since mid-2022, while the 0.5 diagonal is now acting as an inflection point underneath spot price. The current weekly candle is probing that rail from above, echoing the analyst\u2019s separate Ichimoku view that DOGE is \u201cstill under Tenkan resistance\u201d and \u201cwill probably close the week right around 20 cents, then fight another day to push through resistance later. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll get past this level on its first try.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Is \u2018One Of The Best\u2019 In Crypto\u2014$1 Remains Likely: Analyst The longer-term backdrop that keeps the feline strategist constructive is visible on the two-month chart. There, DOGE has printed what fellow technician @ManehattanStonk labels a \u201crising three methods\u201d formation\u2014a bullish continuation pattern that Cantonese Cat notes is \u201cplaying out alongside XLM.\u201d Volume dynamics appear to support the thesis: in another post the analyst calls recent selling \u201cpathetic\u201d and argues: \u201cWho&#8217;s selling DOGE? Nobody important. Sell volume&#8217;s pathetic. All it takes is just some volume to come in and this thing will pump to the moon.\u201d Whether that pump can realistically reach the 2.272 extension\u2014and thus the meme-laden target of $23\u2014is the question that triggered the thread. Cantonese Cat\u2019s answer is blunt: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to $23 this cycle.\u201d The comment underscores his broader point that Fibonacci projections, while mathematically neat, are ultimately hostage to liquidity conditions no one can forecast. The $3.94 region\u2014marked by the 1.618 Fibonacci extension\u2014stands out as a credible upside target. Analyst Kevin notes that in every previous bull cycle, Dogecoin ultimately advanced to this very extension. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.20575.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-booms-bitcoin-hyper-raises-2-5m-btc-l2-bet/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has just surpassed the $120K mark, signaling a strong return of investor confidence. As capital flows beyond Bitcoin, altcoins are seeing a sharp rise in interest. Investors are betting big on early-stage projects, in particular, for their explosive potential in bullish markets. One standout is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has already raised over $2.7M in its token presale. The project\u2019s Layer-2 infrastructure attracts attention for its capacity to make Bitcoin faster, more scalable, and more functionally competitive. The Bitcoin Rally Is On, But Functionality Still Lags The current Bitcoin rally didn\u2019t happen overnight. The bullish story has been building over the past few months, steadily supported by ETF applications from major players, crypto regulations turning positive, and changing macroeconomic sentiments. $BTC is doing what it does best. Time and again, it proves its worth as a store of value, emphasising that investors shouldn\u2019t take the broader crypto market lightly. But Bitcoin&#8217;s capabilities still fall short. Running decentralized apps or scaling transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s main chain continues to be difficult, both technically and financially. This is where Bitcoin Hyper comes in. Rather than treating Bitcoin as sacrosanct, it introduces a Layer-2 solution designed to work with the network. Not around it. What Is Bitcoin Hyper, and Why Are Investors Paying Attention? Bitcoin Hyper is building a Layer-2 blockchain for Bitcoin. The idea is simple. Let Bitcoin remain the secure foundation, while Bitcoin Hyper handles the transactions, the apps, and the ecosystem growth. Here\u2019s what the project has in the works: Scalable transactions via a dedicated Layer-2 network. $BTC deposits and withdrawals through a canonical bridge. Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration to support fast, smart contract-enabled apps. A roadmap that includes full DeFi and NFT support, developer toolkits, and DAO governance. Bitcoin Hyper is currently in Phase 2 of its roadmap, with presale prices increasing in stages. $HYPER tokens can be staked, used for gas, and will eventually unlock exclusive ecosystem features. The tokenomics leans heavily toward development and infrastructure: 30% is allocated to project development, and another 30% to the treasury. Marketing and staking rewards follow, at 25% and 5% respectively. The project has also completed two independent security audits by blockchain security firms Coinsult and Spywolf. The audits confirmed that the coin meets industry standards for reliability and investor protection. Layer-2 Projects Are on the Move and $HYPER Is Tapping In Layer-2 tokens have been making serious moves in recent weeks. $ZKF has surged 84% in the past seven days, while $MAGIC is up 46%. Other notable performers like $LUMIA and $POL have also posted strong double-digit gains, reflecting growing investor interest in scalable blockchain infrastructure. Scalability is no longer optional. It\u2019s a core part of blockchain\u2019s next chapter. And for Bitcoin, which has never been known for speed or flexibility, Layer-2 is likely the way ahead. Given current market trends, $HYPER could reach around $0.02595 by the end of 2025. And assuming the project delivers on its white paper goals (like the mainnet launch, dApp support, and top exchange listings), it might climb as high as $0.253 by 2030. That would mark a return of over 20 times the initial presale price. The above Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) price prediction isn\u2019t guaranteed, of course, but it is based on a fairly simple logic: if Bitcoin gains real utility at scale, the networks that provide it will benefit first. Why Timing Matters More Than Usual Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s token presale is structured around timed price increases. As of now, $HYPER is priced at $0.01225, with the next increase set to trigger in just a few hours. Staking APY also declines over time, encouraging early participation. The presale traffic is growing as the $BTC rally fuels interest in the broader ecosystem. This isn\u2019t just about a good idea. It\u2019s about being early to infrastructure that could play a role in how Bitcoin evolves from a static asset into something developers and users can actually build on. Final Thoughts: Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move is Layer-2 Bitcoin crossing $120K is more than just a milestone. It\u2019s a signal that markets move in phases. While early gains often go to the safest assets, the next leg is likely to reward low-cap altcoins backed by breakthrough projects. Bitcoin Hyper is one of those projects. By bringing scalability and flexibility to Bitcoin through its Layer-2 infrastructure, it positions itself not as a competitor but as a necessary evolution of what Bitcoin can offer. The strong community engagement and presale traffic that\u2019s already raised over $2.7M shows that investors are looking beyond the headline coins. If you\u2019re considering early exposure to Bitcoin Hyper, visit the official presale website to learn more about the Layer-2 infrastructure and secure $HYPER tokens before the next price increase. New to presales? Be sure to read the How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper guide, and, as always, do your own research before making any crypto investment decisions."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-2017-2021/",
      "summary": "With the Bitcoin price rising to new all-time highs every other day, more crypto analysts have come forth with their predictions for where the pioneer cryptocurrency could be headed next. One analyst in particular points out an incredibly bullish development on the Bitcoin price chart that suggests that the rally is far from over. As the trend continues to play out, it is possible that the rise above $118,000 is only the start of the uptrend. Bitcoin Enters Full Price Discovery After clearing the resistance at $117,000, the Bitcoin price has now entered what crypto analysts are referring to as price discovery. This term refers to buyers and sellers determining the price of Bitcoin, and there seems to be a consensus that the digital asset is worth more, and this could trigger the next uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Break Above $118,000 Just The Start, Analyst Unveils \u2018Golden Number\u2019 An analysis from crypto analyst AltcoinGordon focuses on a particular resistance line that has persisted for the Bitcoin price for the last eight years. This resistance line went through the highs from both March and November 2021, and was not broken. Then again, through the nights in May 2025, and remained unbroken. However, the resistance line has finally succumbed to pressure from the bulls and has been broken through after Bitcoin made it through $117,000. This simply means that there is nothing now holding back the digital asset, allowing it to climb freely from here. Due to this, the analyst believes that this breakout is no ordinary breakout, but rather one that triggers the start of parabolas. In this case, a parabolic rally would lead the Bitcoin price above the $130,000 level if the momentum is maintained. BTC Price Discovery Is Good For Altcoins Altcoin Gordon points out that the Bitcoin price discovery is particularly good for altcoins, as they will rally harder. \u201cPrice discovery is in full effect now.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stellar-xlm-set-to-explode-92-rally-sparks-bullish-frenzy-details/",
      "summary": "Stellar (XLM) has seen a sudden burst of activity this week. According to recent data, XLM jumped 12% in the last 24 hours to trade around $0.48. Its seven\u2011day return is even more eye\u2011catching, with a gain of 92%. Trading volume on spot markets climbed to $14 billion, a 17% rise, showing that investors are piling in. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Awaits The Next Bitcoin Sale: \u2018My Fellow Pigs And I Are Feasting\u2019 Support Turns Into Base Based on reports, the old resistance zone at $0.31 up to $0.37 has flipped into a solid support area. That shift gives buyers a clear line in the sand. Wave 3 in the Elliott count seems to be stretching higher, suggesting there\u2019s room for more upside if momentum holds. Derivatives Activity Paints A Mixed Picture Spot volume is surging. But derivatives tell a slightly different story. CoinGlass figures show that derivatives trading volume slipped 2.25% to $3.80 billion even as Open Interest jumped 29% to $496 million. The rise in Open Interest means more new positions are on the table. Yet funding rates indicate traders aren\u2019t over\u2011leveraging just to chase quick gains. Source: Coinglass The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting near 89, well above the usual overbought threshold of 70. That level often triggers short\u2011term pullbacks. Still, in a strong uptrend, RSI can hug lofty readings for longer than many expect. The MACD line at 0.02 lies comfortably above its signal line at 0.01, and the growing histogram bars hint that bullish momentum is not fading anytime soon. Nine-Year Trend Shows Strength Analysts point out that Stellar has logged nine straight years of higher lows. That pattern has held through bear markets and bull runs alike. If that trend stays intact, it could pave the way for a fifth wave\u2014or a Wave C\u2014move similar to past rallies in major altcoins. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Market Activity Signals Caution Traders are keeping a close eye on volume and on\u2011chain signals. Sharp inflections in RSI or a sudden shift in funding rates could spark profit\u2011taking. A pullback toward the $0.35\u2013$0.38 zone would still leave XLM in a bullish setup, and it might give fresh buyers a better entry point. Based on the mix of strong on\u2011chain support, robust momentum indicators, and a long\u2011term uptrend, Stellar looks set for more gains. But with 92% surge in a week, a pause or small correction wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Traders and investors will be watching closely as sessions unfold to see if XLM can push past $0.50 or if it takes that breather first. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-liquidity-supercycle-just-begun-hedge-fund-ceo/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin punched through a fresh record above $122,000 on the morning of 14 July, extending its month-long rally to more than 16 percent. Against that backdrop, Charles Edwards\u2014the founder and chief executive of digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments\u2014argues that the market is only \u201cin the early stages\u201d of a much broader liquidity-driven boom that could dominate the rest of 2025 and beyond. The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle In the latest Capriole newsletter, Edwards contends that \u201cmoney and liquidity provided the backdrop for capital flows, and Bitcoin Treasury Companies are the funnel.\u201d He dismisses the idea that the past fortnight\u2019s $20,000 advance was a technical accident, pointing instead to deep macro currents that have been building for months. \u201cThe biggest Bitcoin rallies occur when the market is net short the USD,\u201d he writes, pointing to Capriole\u2019s proprietary \u201cUSD Positioning\u201d gauge, which aggregates futures data across major currencies. The metric has been \u201cdeeply negative\u201d since early summer, signalling that global investors are decisively betting against the dollar and in favour of hard assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Soar To $146K In The Next Leg Up \u2014 Analyst Explains How Another pillar is credit. BBB-rated corporate-bond spreads have been grinding tighter since the spring, a classic risk-on signal in traditional markets that, since 2020, has mapped almost tick-for-tick onto major Bitcoin up-moves. \u201cMore evidence,\u201d Edwards notes, \u201cthat Bitcoin is a tradfi asset.\u201d Perhaps the strongest tail-wind, however, is raw money growth. Global M3 has been expanding at an annualised nine percent clip\u2014an historically extreme rate that Capriole says last coincided with average 12-month Bitcoin returns of roughly 460 percent. Edwards cautions that, as a multi-trillion-dollar asset today, Bitcoin is unlikely to repeat that magnitude, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see something very substantial from here.\u201d Capriole\u2019s framework also draws on an historical lead-lag relationship between gold and Bitcoin. When bullion enters a meaningful breakout, Bitcoin has tended to follow three to four months later. Gold\u2019s early-2025 surge\u2014and its outperformance versus global equities\u2014therefore offered \u201cstrong support for the current market\u2019s diminishing demand for fiat money and favour of hard money,\u201d Edwards argues. Since Capriole flagged gold\u2019s move in April, Bitcoin has risen 28 percent. Equities, too, are offering green lights. The New York Stock Exchange advance\u2013decline line broke to new highs last week, while Capriole\u2019s \u201cEquity Premium\u201d indicator reset to zero in late May\u2014both historically consistent with multi-month stretches of expanding risk appetite. All of those data points feed into the firm\u2019s flagship Bitcoin Macro Index, a composite of dozens of public and proprietary variables that Capriole uses to shape trading exposures in its fund. The index \u201cis still in strong positive growth territory,\u201d Edwards reports, even after the coin\u2019s latest vertical move. That suggests the underlying drivers\u2014liquidity, risk sentiment and on-chain activity\u2014\u201cremain intact.\u201d The Bitcoin Treasury-Company Flywheel Yet perhaps the most striking piece of the puzzle lies outside pure macro. Edwards highlights the emergence of Bitcoin Treasury Companies (TCs)\u2014corporate vehicles that raise fiat capital in equity or debt markets and then deploy it into spot BTC\u2014as the new \u201cprimary bubble dynamic of this cycle.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800\u2014Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? Quarterly inflows into TCs reached $15 billion in Q2, and Capriole counts at least 145 such firms now pursuing the strategy. With their market capitalisations inflated by paper gains on balance-sheet coins, they can tap ever-larger funding rounds\u2014a reflexive loop that Edwards believes \u201cwill likely help add over $1 trillion to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap over the next year.\u201d He rejects the notion that this amounts to unhealthy centralisation: \u201cIf Bitcoin is to one day become base money, it needs to scale to tens of trillions to flatten volatility. The only way that happens is mass acquisition like we are seeing today.\u201d Edwards stresses that his analysis sits on a months-long horizon. \u201cWhen Bitcoin sees huge rallies there are always strong pullbacks and local overheating,\u201d he concedes, adding that the newsletter deliberately sidelines short-term on-chain froth to focus on the \u201cbigger picture and driving factors for the next six months.\u201d Still, with central-bank liquidity abundant, the dollar crowded short, credit stress muted and a structurally new pool of corporate buyers stepping in, Capriole\u2019s conclusion is unambiguous: the liquidity tap is wide open, and the Bitcoin supercycle it feeds has only just begun. \u201cWhile today\u2019s early adopters may be seen as speculators, it will be very obvious in hindsight. After the Treasury company wave is the Government treasury wave (next cycle). We are simply riding the adoption curve which requires trillions of dollars to flow in to Bitcoin from the entities that have it in order to achieve scale,\u201d Edwards concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $122,438. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
