      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s summer rally accelerated in the early hours of 11 July, when the benchmark cryptocurrency sliced through $118,000 and printed exchange highs that peaked above $118,800, depending on venue data. The spike wiped out an estimated $1.25 billion in short positions within a single trading day, according to CoinGlass figures. Bitcoin Bull Trap Or Breakout? Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards took to X as the breakout unfolded. \u201cNew all-time highs beget new ATHs. It\u2019s usually unwise to ignore a major breakout like this, until invalidated,\u201d he wrote, adding that corporate treasury demand has \u201cgrown exponentially, with dozens of new companies popping up in recent months.\u201d Edwards\u2019 base-case projection calls for a further 50\u201370 percent advance over the next six months\u2014roughly $170,000\u2013$196,000. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY\u2014If Treasury Firms Hold His focus on treasuries is backed by hard data. Public companies added a record 159,107 BTC in Q2\u2014pushing aggregate corporate holdings above 847,000 BTC, or about four percent of max supply. Corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have even outpaced ETF net inflows. Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck, framed Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory within a broader macro and policy backdrop. \u201cThe natural course for Bitcoin remains higher, driven by persistent US debt and deficit problems, demographic tailwinds, a weakening dollar, growing momentum around Fed rate cuts, and the potential for a new Fed chair next year,\u201d he wrote on X. Sigel also highlighted Capitol Hill\u2019s looming \u201cCrypto Week,\u201d where stablecoin legislation is widely viewed as the most passable of several digital-asset bills. Those developments, he argues, make $180,000 \u201cvery much in play for 2025.\u201d Law-makers appear to share the sense of urgency. A press statement from the House Financial Services Committee confirms that the week of 14 July will be dedicated to advancing the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the GENIUS Act. Passage would establish the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and market structure, a change Sigel says could \u201cunlock wide-open capital markets\u201d for the sector.

Yet Edwards and Sigel both note that treasury companies have become the marginal buyer in 2025. The dynamic creates what Edwards calls a \u201ccap-raising flywheel,\u201d as firms showcase outperforming share prices\u2014up nearly 60 percent year-to-date for the treasury cohort\u2014when courting investors. Notably, the rally is unfolding against a supportive macro backdrop. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told a Dallas Fed audience he is \u201copen to cutting the policy rate in July,\u201d arguing current settings are \u201ctoo tight\u201d given waning inflation pressures. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell over the past weeks, demanding immediate rate cuts. Trump\u2019s tariff escalation also seems to fade out, supporting the Bitcoin rally. Notwithstanding euphoric headlines, technicians warn that momentum must sustain above $110,000 to avoid a failed-breakout pattern. \u201cThis theory would be weakened with closes below $110K and invalidated below $105K,\u201d Edwards concludes.

      "summary": "The Ethereum price is once again gaining momentum and looks set to reach new highs. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on how the altcoin has broken through a crucial moving average (MA). Meanwhile, ETH\u2019s dominance is again on the rise. Ethereum Price Breaks 50EMA On Weekly Chart In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that after 9 weeks of constant rejection at the EMA50 on the weekly chart, the Ethereum price has finally broken through. He claimed that it was a very good sign, as it suggests that ETH will reach higher targets in the coming weeks. The break above the 2,600 EMA50 level came as the broader crypto market rallied. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here? This rally has been led by the Bitcoin price, which has reached new all-time highs (ATHs). Based on this, the Ethereum price is expected to also reach new highs, with the yearly high of $3,600 already in sight. A reclaim of this level could also pave the way for ETH to reclaim the psychological $4,000 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital alluded to the rising dominance of the Ethereum price. He noted that this ETH dominance fractal will not be a copy-paste version of what happened between 2019 and 2020. However, the analyst claimed that the recent rise to 10% of the dominance level shows that Ethereum wants to become more market-dominant in the coming months. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also believes that it is time for the Ethereum price to make its move. In an X post, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $10,000 on this upward trend. He made this prediction while highlighting ETH\u2019s chart against its BTC pair, suggesting that he also agrees that Ethereum\u2019s dominance will rise in the coming months. ETH\u2019s Move To Trigger Altcoin Season In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that the Ethereum price is following the Wyckoff re-accumulation schematic. He further remarked that this massive move will trigger altcoin season after ETH reaches the \u201cSOS\u201d level around $3,000. His accompanying chart also showed that he expects Ethereum to reach as high as $3,200 in the short term.

This is bullish for the Ethereum price and other altcoins as they would outperform BTC during this period. It is worth mentioning that Mikybull Crypto has also predicted that ETH can reach $10,000 in this market cycle.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) above $118,000, but on-chain data from Glassnode shows BTC volume remains low despite the breakout. Bitcoin Volume Still At Historically Low Levels Just recently, Glassnode had revealed that volume related to Bitcoin had dropped to yearly lows, potentially hinting at the start of a summer lull. Now, following the breakout to new highs, the on-chain analytics firm has shared updated data in a reply to an X user, showcasing how volume has changed since. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that both the Spot and Futures Volumes, corresponding to Bitcoin trading activity occurring on the spot and futures platforms, respectively, plummeted at the end of June and remained low into early July. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle\u2014Next Stop $164? With the latest price breakout, however, both metrics have seen an increase, suggesting activity has noted an uplift across both the spot and futures markets. That said, while there has indeed been an uptick in trading, volumes still remain low when compared to history. Historically, rallies have usually only been sustainable when they have been able to capture mass attention from the traders. This is because the fresh activity is what ends up providing fuel for these runs to keep going. &#8220;The takeaway here is that BTC hit an ATH despite thin liquidity &#8211; worth paying attention to,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether the activity increase would continue in the coming days or if the lull is here to stay. In some other news, a key Bitcoin indicator still remains outside the euphoria zone, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. The metric in question is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) of the long-term holders. The NUPL measures, as its name suggests, the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the BTC investors are currently holding. Here, the NUPL of the long-term holders (LTHs) specifically is of interest, who are the investors holding their coins for more than 155 days. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin LTH NUPL over the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH NUPL has observed a rise alongside the latest price rally as LTH profits have grown. However, despite this, the indicator stands at 0.69, which is under the 0.75 level that has historically separated euphoric markets.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-targets-liquidity-above-3000-price-magnet-forming/",
      "summary": "Ethereum just broke above the critical $3,000 level, marking a major technical milestone after surging over 20% since Tuesday. This decisive breakout signals renewed strength in the second-largest cryptocurrency, with bulls reclaiming control after weeks of tight consolidation. The move is reigniting interest across the broader altcoin market, which had remained relatively muted during Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally to all-time highs. Now, with ETH leading the charge, many altcoins are showing signs of reversal and upward momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level \u2013 Relief Or Reversal? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, a key factor behind Ethereum\u2019s rally is the large concentration of liquidity resting just above the $3,000 mark. Once Ethereum cleared the $2,850 resistance, momentum rapidly accelerated, driving price through the $3,000 level and into a new range of opportunity. This rally comes amid a broader shift in market sentiment. As Bitcoin sets record highs, Ethereum and other altcoins appear poised to catch up. The big question now: can ETH maintain this level and lead a full altcoin season, or is this just a temporary breakout before another round of consolidation? Ethereum Breaks Out Of Consolidation Range Ethereum has spent the last several weeks consolidating within a clearly defined range that began in early May. The altcoin hovered between support around $2,800 and resistance just below $3,000, with multiple failed attempts to break above. That changed yesterday. ETH finally closed above this key resistance, signaling a potential breakout and confirming the start of a new bullish phase. This move comes as broader macroeconomic conditions improve. Strong labor market data in the US, alongside signs of de-escalation in several global conflicts, have helped reduce uncertainty and reignite risk appetite across financial markets. With Bitcoin reaching new highs and risk-on sentiment returning, Ethereum\u2019s breakout may signal the next wave of upside for altcoins. Top analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a key technical factor: \u201cETH liquidity is lying above $3,000 \u2014 and liquidity is a magnet.\u201d This means that large clusters of buy and stop orders are concentrated above this level, attracting price movement toward those zones. Now that Ethereum has broken past resistance, the presence of high liquidity could accelerate its move upward as traders chase momentum. The breakout also holds symbolic weight. It shows that investors are regaining confidence in Ethereum\u2019s value proposition, particularly with the broader altcoin market showing signs of life. If ETH can hold this breakout and establish $3,000 as new support, the next leg higher could materialize quickly, opening the door to targets in the $3,400\u2013$3,600 range. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason ETH Breaks Major Resistance Ethereum (ETH) has decisively broken above the psychological and technical resistance at $3,000, closing its most recent candle at $3,008.97. This breakout follows a strong 15% daily surge, as seen in the chart, marking a powerful move backed by growing bullish momentum. Volume has expanded significantly, confirming trader conviction and institutional participation in this move. The breakout puts an end to nearly two months of sideways action, with ETH previously locked between the $2,500\u2013$2,850 range. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $2,796, was breached with strength, acting as a springboard for price acceleration. The reclaim of this moving average adds technical validation to the breakout and signals the beginning of a new bullish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves ETH is now in a key zone for potential continuation. As long as bulls defend the $2,850\u2013$2,900 level as support, Ethereum has room to rally toward $3,400 and beyond. With Bitcoin trading at all-time highs and macro conditions turning favorable for risk assets, ETH could lead the next wave of altcoin expansion. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
