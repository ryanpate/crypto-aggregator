      "title": "Litecoin Wobbles Under Pressure: Can It Find Footing Below $87?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-wobbles-under-pressure/",
      "summary": "Grayhoood, a crypto trader, said on X that Litecoin is currently experiencing a bearish trend, emphasizing the ongoing weakness in price action. Over the past 24 hours, LTC has decreased by 2.8%, and the candlestick charts reflect a noticeable downward movement. As shown in the chart he referenced, LTC started the day around $89.00 but faced a sharp decline, dropping to $87.00 before managing a brief recovery to $88.50. However, the price has since fallen again to $84, indicating sustained selling pressure in the short term. Momentum Fades: RSI Drifts Toward Oversold Territory According to Grayhoood, current technical indicators suggest that Litecoin may face further downside, with multiple metrics aligning to support a bearish short-term outlook. One of the primary indicators in focus is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which appears to be drifting toward oversold territory. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D\u2019s Next Move While such a move could hint at a potential bounce, Grayhoood cautions that it also signals bearish sentiment in the market. Beyond the RSI, momentum oscillators such as the Stochastic indicator and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) are also painting a gloomy picture. These tools are typically used to gauge market reversals and the strength of ongoing trends. In this case, both are tilting toward further downward momentum if no strong bullish catalyst appears, especially as prices struggle to hold above the $87 support level. Short-Term Declines Contrast with Yearly Gains in LTC\u2019s Moving Averages The analyst further highlighted a mixed outlook from Litecoin\u2019s moving averages, suggesting a market caught between short-term weakness and long-term potential. In the near term, shorter-duration averages are flashing strong sell signals. These are driven by LTC\u2019s recent negative performance, with a -9.0% drop over the past week and a -12.5% decline over the last two weeks, painting a clear picture of growing bearish momentum and sustained selling pressure. Related Reading: Market Expert Projects \u2018Undervalued\u2019 Litecoin To Soar At Least 1,000% \u2014 Here\u2019s How However, the longer-term moving averages tell a different story. Despite recent setbacks, Litecoin has posted a 2.3% gain over the past year, which keeps the long-term trend technically bullish. This divergence suggests that while short-term traders may be responding to immediate price volatility and weakness, long-term investors could still see value in the asset, especially if broader market conditions stabilize or improve. That said, the broader market sentiment currently leans bearish, weighed down by Litecoin\u2019s inability to maintain key support levels amid recent price volatility. Even with long-term growth providing a degree of optimism, the prevailing trend is defined by downward pressure and uncertainty. Until short-term indicators begin to align with the long-term bullish structure, Litecoin may continue to face a challenging environment. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/bloodbath-incoming-dogecoin-must-hold-this-level/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s daily time-frame has reached a critical point that leaves virtually no margin for error. Price settled last night at $0.17551, clinging to a slender cushion just above the confluence of two of the chart\u2019s most important guide rails: the former down-trend resistance that runs from late February and the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2024\u2019s late advance to $0.48440. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone The structural landscape is defined by a six-month descending channel that has corralled every impulse since Dogecoin topped at $0.48440 on 8 December. The median of that channel\u2014slicing through the field at roughly $0.1800\u2014functioned as durable support until Thursday, when an 11% slide in sympathy with Bitcoin split it cleanly. A failure-retest of a channel mid-line is seldom trivial; until DOGE can reclaim $0.1800 on a closing basis, the chart message remains one of trend continuity. Beneath the market, the black trendline that first rejected rallies on 26 March, 26 April and 2 May reclaimed centre-stage after price vaulted it on 8 May, ran to the channel ceiling at $0.2540, and was twice rebuffed\u2014the first rejection on 11 May, the second on 23 May. The trendline is now retested as support where it intersects the 0.786 Fib at $0.16700, producing a high-stakes cross-point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst If that level fractures, the only historical scaffolding is the multi-year ascending trendline (drawn from May 2021\u2019s all-time high) that merges with a proven demand band spanning $0.14500 to $0.13500. That rectangle arrested the early-April shake-out and would represent the bulls\u2019 final trench; surrendering it would invalidate the long-term series of higher lows and almost certainly inaugurate a broader bear phase with potential gravitational pull back to the January pivot at $0.12990. Oscillators and overlays do little to contradict the bearish drift. The fourteen-day Relative Strength Index sits at 34.70, hovering just above oversold territory but still tracking below its own moving average at 45.22, underscoring persistent negative momentum. Price Targets Overhead, resistance layers are stacked like dominoes. Immediate priority for the bulls is a daily close back above the channel midline at $0.1800; failing that, any attempt at recovery is suspect. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The next ceiling is the compressing exponential moving average cluster: the 20-day EMA at $0.20120, the 50-day at $0.20091, the 100-day at $0.20677 and the 200-day at $0.21550. With all four averages declining and bunched inside a three-cent band, they act as a single reinforced lid near the psychological $0.20 handle. Clearing that barricade would deliver price to the channel\u2019s upper rail, now descending through $0.22. A weekly close outside that boundary would finally neutralise the half-year downtrend and force shorts to cover into the next Fibonacci checkpoints derived from the November high: the 61.8 percent retracement at $0.23484, the 50 percent at $0.28249, the 38.2 percent at $0.33014 and the 23.6 percent at $0.38910. Until then, however, the blunt arithmetic favours the bears. A floor at $0.16700 backed by a multi-touch trendline is slim protection when sentiment is fragile and macro flows are unhelpful. If that shelf cracks, the market\u2019s inertia points toward $0.14500\u2013$0.13500, Dogecoin\u2019s last defensible plateau. Should that red demand zone capitulate, the technical map turns blank down to the January base at $0.12990 and, beyond that into deep bearish territory, especially the August 2024 low at $0.08.

Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a bullish pattern on ETH\u2019s chart, which provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin. Ethereum Eyes $3,300 As Morningstar Candle Pattern Forms In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that Ethereum could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern forms for the largest altcoin by market cap. This came as he highlighted the bullish monthly close for ETH and alluded to the monthly chart printing this bullish pattern. With this, the analyst expects a significant rally from Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH Crypto Bullet noted that Ethereum is now facing tough resistance, but he believes that the $2,500 resistance will be broken.

He remarked that the first major level to reclaim is $3,100, which will be followed by a small correction. Following that, Ash Crypto is confident that ETH will then surge to $4,000, which will initiate an explosive rally. The analyst affirmed that $10,000 is programmed for ETH in this cycle. As reported, crypto analyst Crypto GEM recently predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,000 by next year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also highlighted $5,000, $7,000, and $8,500 as the targets for ETH\u2019s market structure. Meanwhile, just like Ash Crypto, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is also confident that the altcoin can reach as high as $10,000 in this market cycle. He highlighted a similarity between Ethereum\u2019s current price action and that of the 2017 market cycle. Ongoing V-Shape Recovery For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted an ongoing V-shape recovery for Ethereum. He noted that ETH has kicked off a sharp reversal, forming a classic V-shape structure on the weekly chart. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $7,600 on this run-up.

      "summary": "Tim Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has doubled down on his call for Bitcoin to hit $250,000 by the end of 2025. He shared this on X, renewing a prediction he first made in 2018 when he set his sights on reaching that mark by 2022.

Still, Draper believes today\u2019s drivers are strong enough to push prices higher. He even suggested that the US dollar might vanish in a decade as Bitcoin takes its place. Tim Draper\u2019s Bold Timeline According to Draper, the $250,000 target isn\u2019t just wishful thinking. In 2018, he said Bitcoin would reach that level by 2022. It didn\u2019t happen\u20142022 saw many digital assets tumble in value. This year, though, he repeated his forecast after seeing a \u201crecent surge\u201d in the crypto. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I\u2019m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: \u2192 General optimism\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy \u2014 Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 He also claimed Bitcoin could become \u201cinfinite against the dollar,\u201d arguing that in 10 years the US dollar wouldn\u2019t exist. His confident tone suggests he\u2019s sticking with the same numbers\u2014$250,000 by December 31, 2025. Political And Regulatory Drivers Based on reports, Draper points to politics as a big catalyst. He highlighted moves by US President Donald Trump, who is working on new trade deals. One sign of this push is the Media &#38; Technology Group\u2019s filing on June 5, 2025, for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. That application is headed to the NYSE Arca, with Crypto.com lined up as custodian, and it aims to bring more mainstream money into Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, the US Senate voted 66\u201332 on May 19 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would set rules for stablecoins. Plus, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 is under debate. It has bipartisan support and is meant to spell out clear rules for crypto. Financial Institutions And Adoption Draper also sees banks and big companies stepping in. He mentioned that JP Morgan plans to let its clients buy Bitcoin and use spot-BTC ETFs\u2014like BlackRock\u2019s IBIT\u2014as collateral. That shift could open doors to a flood of institutional cash. Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy leads the pack, holding over 580,000 BTC. At current prices, that stash is worth about $61 billion. These moves, Draper argues, point to people treating Bitcoin more like gold than a risky token.

      "summary": "The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a significant decline on Thursday, falling over 7% and approaching the $2,400 mark. However, expert analysis suggests that a new bullish trend may soon emerge for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Key Metrics Indicate Accumulation By Larger Investors Market analyst Lark Davis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum&#8217;s potential. He noted that various on-chain metrics and market behaviors indicate an impending breakout for the ETH price. Notably, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter of the year, suggesting growing investor confidence. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved Ethereum\u2019s scalability and reduced its inflation rate, making it more attractive to investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over Additionally, the expert highlights that with exchange balances hitting seven-year lows and substantial inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it appears that larger investors are accumulating ETH for the long term. Despite these bullish indicators, Davis cautioned that not all market participants share this optimistic outlook. Betting markets on Polymarket currently assign only a 27% chance that Ethereum will reach a new all-time high by 2025. Critical Support For Ethereum Amid Political Disputes The broader cryptocurrency market also faced challenges on Thursday, with total market capitalization dropping from $3.30 trillion to approximately $3.12 trillion. Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana (SOL) were among the notable cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, retracing by 3%, 5%, and 6%, respectively. In a separate but related development, tensions between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk have surfaced, adding to the day\u2019s market volatility. Trump expressed disappointment over Musk&#8217;s criticism of a key tax and spending bill from his administration, suggesting that their &#8220;great relationship&#8221; may be nearing its end. Musk retaliated by accusing Trump of ingratitude, claiming his support was instrumental in Trump\u2019s election victory. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 This public dispute has drawn attention to the intersection of US politics and cryptocurrency, a dynamic that market analyst Income Sharks noted in a recent post on Elon Musk\u2019s social media site, X. The analyst remarked on the swift impact of political conflicts on crypto markets, emphasizing that the Ethereum price has not yet lost critical support levels. Income Sharks, in his analysis, identified the $2,390 mark as a crucial support point for the altcoin in the immediate term, which could determine the next upward targets of $3,000 and $4,000. While trading at $2,406 when writing, Ethereum finds itself well below its all-time high reached during the market\u2019s last bullish cycle in 2021. As of now, the altcoin stands 50% below its record of $4,878, according to CoinGecko data. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"
