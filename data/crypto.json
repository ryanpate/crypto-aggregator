      "summary": "Hours after Ripple Labs said it would abandon its long-running appeal in its securities case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, watched market technician CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) on X argued that XRP\u2019s price structure has already completed its corrective phase and is \u201cnow wave 3 in motion.\u201d The pseudonymous trader described how Friday\u2019s slide to $2.07 had \u201ctagged\u201d three separate Fibonacci confluence markers\u2014the 0.618 retracement of the March-to-May rally, a 1:1 equality projection for wave C of the prior correction, and a 0.618 extension of sub-wave 5. \u201cThe market snapped upward from that exact price,\u201d she observed, before adding: \u201c$2.07 tagged. $2.25 loading. XRP breakout in progress!\u201d XRP Enters Wave 3 By midday in Europe on Monday XRP was changing hands at $2.19, roughly 4% above Friday\u2019s close and 8.5% higher than a week ago. That recovery has carried the token to the edge of the next \u201cmajor test\u201d cited by CasiTrades: the long-monitored $2.25 zone, which she notes coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement measured from XRP\u2019s 2021 swing high. In classical Elliott Wave analysis, a decisive breach and subsequent retest of that level would validate the start of a powerful third wave, the phase in which momentum typically accelerates and sentiment flips decisively bullish. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish CasiTrades outlined two near-term paths: either a brief thrust to $2.30 followed by a healthy back-test of $2.25, or a more explosive extension toward $2.45\u20132.69 before any significant pull-back. \u201cFrom here, I\u2019m watching two key scenarios short-term: 1) A move into $2.30, then a pullback to backtest $2.25 as support. This would be ideal and healthy. 2) Or, price pushes harder through to ~$2.45, closer toward $2.69 resistance. Has a small pullback, before touching $2.69 with resistance. In this plan, a backtest of $2.25 later would be expected,\u201d Casi writes via X. In either scenario, she argues, the structural message is the same: \u201cFlipping that level opens the door for the next full breakout\u2026 once these local resistances are out of the way \u2192 fireworks.\u201d The technical argument lands at a moment when a key fundamental overhang appears to be fading. On June 27 Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company will withdraw the cross-appeal it filed last year contesting parts of Judge Analisa Torres\u2019s split decision on XRP sales. \u201cWe\u2019re closing this chapter once and for all,\u201d Garlinghouse wrote on X, adding that the SEC \u201cwas also expected to drop its appeal.\u201d The move came one day after Torres rejected a joint request from both parties to shrink Ripple\u2019s civil penalty to $50 million and dissolve her permanent injunction. Related Reading: XRP Bulls On Alert\u2014\u2019This Trendline Is Everything,\u2019 Says Analyst That backdrop helps explain why the Fibonacci \u201cgolden-ratio\u201d bounce at $2.07 drew such an emphatic response. But for now, the market\u2019s focal point is whether XRP can turn the $2.25 shelf from resistance into support. If it does, the next cluster of historical supply sits between $2.60 and $2.70\u2014the area that capped rallies in December 2021 and March 2022. A break beyond that zone would leave little chart resistance before psychological milestones at $3.00 and the all-time closing high near $3.40 set in January 2018. Even so, technicians caution that Elliott Wave targets remain probabilistic, not predictive certainties, and that any new macro-regulatory twist could reset the calculus. Friday\u2019s ruling also left Ripple\u2019s injunction intact, meaning the company must still navigate a compliance regime that did not exist when the lawsuit began in 2020. Whether those realities temper the exuberance around wave 3 remains to be seen. In CasiTrades\u2019 words, however, timing is everything: \u201cThis is exactly why we rely on TA. The charts help us spot setups before the news hits. News hits harder after price has positioned.\u201d For a market that has waited more than four years to see its signature legal saga reach closure, traders appear ready to test that maxim on the road to $2.25\u2014and beyond.

According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, the network has rolled out a string of upgrades, yet it still needs a strong message to win over users and investors. He argues that without a clear voice steering the story, those technical gains risk getting lost in the noise. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin\u2019s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength Network Champions New Features Cardano\u2019s team has added Leios, a new smart contract framework, and Hydra, a layer\u20112 scaling solution that promises faster transactions.

At the same time, Lace Wallet is gaining traction among everyday users, and USDM, a stablecoin backed by dollar reserves, is picking up steam. We got Leios, Hydra, Midnight, and Bitcoin DeFi alongside governance, security and decentralization. Bitcoin DeFi is indeed the largest opportunity, but the single biggest issue is that we are missing a competent Foundation and executive authority to push these narratives into\u2026 https://t.co/t3j4ULTTe8 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 29, 2025 Hoskinson Points To Executive Gap Despite those wins, Hoskinson says Cardano is missing a \u201ccompetent Foundation and executive authority\u201d to shape market views. He\u2019s taken to X to share his concerns, but some in the community have pushed back hard. A few podcasters and thought leaders have labeled Cardano a \u201cdying chain.\u201d Hoskinson admits that stepping into the narrative has drawn plenty of criticism\u2014yet he feels it\u2019s needed if Cardano is to claim its place in Bitcoin\u2011based finance. Input Output Global\u2019s Role Input Output Global (IOG), Hoskinson\u2019s company, will keep guiding Cardano as its core coordinator. He warns this work comes at a cost: \u201cIt\u2019s been brutal and expensive this year,\u201d he said, referring to waves of negative comments and legal threats. He adds that it\u2019s \u201cdehumanizing\u201d to be blamed for every hiccup on the network while not getting credit for the wins. Related Reading: Crypto Bombshell: Developer Claims XRP Could Hit $20,000 Rare Evo Conference In Focus Looking ahead, Hoskinson is counting on Rare Evo, a crypto conference, to reset the conversation. He believes the community will use that event to settle governance questions and update Cardano\u2019s constitution with delegated executive powers. There\u2019s even talk of a sovereign wealth fund to back Bitcoin DeFi on the chain. Built on top of Bitcoin, Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) is a network of decentralized financial applications. Last year, Hoskinson pushed a plan to convert $100 million worth of ADA into stablecoin liquidity. That idea sparked fierce debate. Now, he hopes Rare Evo will help turn bold ideas into solid support. Cardano\u2019s path forward may hinge on blending strong tech work with a clear, unified story.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-freezes-og-whales-dump-on-wall-street/",
      "summary": "While Bitcoin continues to hover above the $100,000 threshold, the driving forces behind this historic consolidation phase appear to be more complex than the surface-level narratives of institutional \u201cFOMO\u201d and ETF euphoria. According to multiple leading analysts, a silent rotation is underway\u2014one that suggests long-term holders are offloading their positions while corporate treasuries and institutional buyers quietly absorb the flood. OG Bitcoin Whales Are &#8216;Dumping&#8217; On Wall Street Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, delivered a sobering breakdown via X on June 29, challenging the prevailing belief that Bitcoin\u2019s price stagnation amid surging demand is anomalous. \u201cPeople are wondering why BTC has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDespite what X news might suggest, it&#8217;s because Bitcoin OGs (long-term holders) have been dumping on Wall St since the ETF Launch in January 2024, unloading their positions.\u201d Edwards, known for blending on-chain metrics with macro frameworks, pointed to a visible dynamic shift that is now being captured in blockchain data. While older coins are being redistributed, a newer class of holders\u2014primarily treasury-oriented entities\u2014are stepping in aggressively. \u201cWe have clearly entered the heat of [the Treasury Company] trend today as many copy-cats have entered the market,\u201d he said, referencing his earlier prediction on Bits and Bips that corporate adoption would eventually eclipse ETF inflows in relevance. What makes this transition particularly remarkable is the data behind it. Edwards highlighted that 6-month-plus BTC holders\u2014commonly associated with more strategic, non-speculative accumulation\u2014have skyrocketed in the past two months. \u201cThe amount of BTC acquired in the last 2 months by this cohort has completely consumed all of the BTC unloaded by LTHs over the last 1.5 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIncredible.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin In Stalemate With Liquidation Traps On Both Sides Of The Market This cohort&#8217;s aggressive accumulation, he added, has historically preceded bullish squeezes. \u201cWhenever aggressive spikes in 6M+ holders occur, price usually squeezes following these periods. Short-term bullish,\u201d Edwards remarked. However, he tempered the optimism by cautioning that broader on-chain data still signals fragility. \u201cIf the 6M+ holders (Treasury Companies) can continue their relentless buying, that should be achievable,\u201d he noted, signaling that the flywheel has momentum, but is not yet immune to systemic pressure. Adding another layer to this developing narrative, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Co-founder and CSO at Ledn, offered an alternative theory. He suggested that what appears as two flows\u2014LTHs selling and Treasury entities buying\u2014might in fact be \u201cthe same trade.\u201d He wrote, \u201cLong term holders [are] selling spot to buy ETFs/BTC Treasury Cos. Even though that feels unnatural for us bitcoiners.\u201d Di Bartolomeo framed the shift as generational, pointing out that many early adopters may simply be more comfortable in traditional financial custody rather than self-sovereign wallets. Related Reading: Analyst Spots Bitcoin Time Bomb Hidden In Bullish Weekly Chart But Edwards pushed back on that explanation, arguing that if ETF migration was driving the reclassification of long-term holders, it would be evident across multiple aging cohorts. \u201cI don&#8217;t think so because we would have seen a similar uptrend over time in the 6M+ and 1Yr+ cohorts if that was the case,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome is definitely moving to equities, but it&#8217;s very typical of this stage of the Halving cycle to see LTH selling into profit.\u201d Why Bitcoin ETF Do Not Have A 1:1 Effect On Price The apparent dissonance between rising demand and stagnant price has also prompted commentary from on-chain analyst TXMC, who warned that most observers misunderstand what actually sets Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cBitcoin people grossly underestimate how little of the supply is actually setting the price every hour,\u201d he wrote. He described Bitcoin\u2019s fragmented market structure as a web of siloed exchanges, loosely synchronized through cross-exchange market-making. \u201cEach location has its own liquidity and depth which vary wildly. A large market order can have an outsized effect depending on which exchange it is placed at, and which time of day.\u201d TXMC argued that while ETFs and institutional desks are accumulating large quantities of Bitcoin, much of this activity is routed through OTC desks that bypass order books entirely. \u201cThese actions do not affect the price in the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe desks source their own liquidity, and only have to go into the books to fill the difference.\u201d This explanation may help reconcile why ETF inflows in the billions of dollars have failed to push BTC significantly higher. Edwards\u2019 thesis aligns with this too, insofar as the ETF boom may be fueling redistribution rather than outright net demand. TXMC added: \u201cStop underestimating how many big entities are out there looking for exit liquidity.\u201d Despite growing bullishness in cohort composition, the real test lies ahead. Whether corporate treasuries and ETF managers can absorb the remaining exit waves of Bitcoin\u2019s earliest holders remains to be seen. But if Edwards is right, the rotation may already be past its critical phase. \u201cThe flywheel still has a long way to go,\u201d Edwards concluded. And if history is any guide, these moments of consolidation amid redistribution tend to precede volatility\u2014not follow it. At press time, BTC traded at $108,044.

      "summary": "As the market\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), struggles to maintain momentum above the crucial $2,500 threshold, one analyst believes that ETH is poised for a significant rally. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. &#8220;Most doubt ETH and altcoins right now\u2014I&#8217;m betting on $4,000 this summer,&#8221; he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop&#8217;s analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"
