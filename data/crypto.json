      "summary": "Following a quick drop to nearly $98,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered most of its recent losses and is now trading above $107,000 at the time of writing. Fresh on-chain data suggests that the short-term holder (STH) floor for BTC has been steadily rising toward the $100,000 level. Bitcoin STH Floor Approaching $100,000 According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor unchained, Bitcoin\u2019s STH Realized Price has been making its slow grind up toward the psychologically important $100,000 level. Notably, the analyst had earlier dubbed this metric as the \u201cfault line\u201d to watch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the STH Realized Price represents the average price at which all Bitcoin held for less than 155 days was acquired. It acts as both a key psychological and technical support level. When the market price stays above it, STH are in profit and more confident, whereas if it falls below, fear and selling pressure often increase. Currently, the STH Realized Price hovers around $98,000. The analyst notes that each $500 rise in the STH Realized Price effectively resets the \u201cnew buyers\u2019 comfort floor.\u201d As this metric nears six figures, the mental stop-loss for newer investors also moves upward. The following chart illustrates two recent instances where BTC bounced sharply after touching the blue STH Realized Price line. This price action suggests a bullish structure, where selling pressure diminishes as soon as BTC revisits its average cost basis. Meanwhile, the premium &#8211; the difference between BTC\u2019s spot price and STH Realized Price &#8211; currently hovers around 7.2%. A shrinking premium, typically under 10%, has historically signalled reduced market froth and often preceded the next leg up once open interest began to rebuild. On the long-term side, the long-term holder (LTH) Realized Price remains largely unchanged at $32,000, roughly one-third of the STH Realized Price. The analyst observes that these long-term coins are likely held in cold storage, indicating \u201cstrong hands\u201d with little incentive to sell. They concluded: The blue line is climbing relentlessly; as long as BTC lives above it, the prevailing tide is still higher-lows, higher-highs. Lose it on a daily close, and we get our first real gut-check since April &#8211; otherwise the bull engine is merely cooling its cylinders. Experts Predict New High For BTC As BTC\u2019s STH Realized Price continues to surge higher &#8211; resulting in a higher floor price for the digital asset &#8211; several crypto experts seem to agree that the cryptocurrency may soon reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months.

      "summary": "Ethereum has experienced a strong comeback after weeks of uncertainty and bearish momentum. Following a sharp breakdown below its long-standing consolidation range, ETH found support near the $2,100 level and has since surged 15% from Sunday\u2019s low. The move comes amid improving market sentiment after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran helped ease geopolitical tensions, while broader macroeconomic conditions remain in flux. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply This recent bounce has placed Ethereum back into a critical technical zone, where bulls are once again attempting to reclaim control. After spending much of May and June in a sideways range, ETH is showing signs of renewed strength, fueling optimism that the next decisive move could be to the upside. Top analyst Mister Crypto shared a bullish technical outlook, highlighting that Ethereum is getting ready for a breakout. According to his view, the current price structure and momentum suggest ETH may be preparing to challenge previous resistance levels and enter a new phase of expansion. With on-chain activity starting to pick up and broader market confidence slowly returning, Ethereum could be positioning itself as the key altcoin to lead a potential rally in the coming weeks. Ethereum Reclaims Strength Ethereum has surged more than 15% from Sunday\u2019s lows, recovering from sharp losses triggered by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran sent a wave of relief through global markets, with ETH leading the charge among major altcoins. After briefly losing key support levels, bulls are regaining momentum as Ethereum reclaims price levels last seen before the breakdown. This rebound marks a crucial moment for ETH, as it tests the strength of current market sentiment. While macroeconomic uncertainty continues\u2014driven by growing fears of a U.S. recession, rising bond yields, and a cautious Federal Reserve\u2014Ethereum appears to be consolidating for a potential breakout. The broader crypto market remains on edge, with altcoins underperforming Bitcoin, and many investors watching Ethereum closely as the likely catalyst for the long-awaited altseason. According to Mister Crypto, Ethereum is now preparing for a breakout above the $2,800 resistance. This level represents a major psychological and structural barrier, and a decisive move beyond it could redefine ETH\u2019s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Volume is returning, and on-chain data shows rising confidence from long-term holders, signaling a potential shift in trend. If bulls succeed in pushing ETH past this zone, it could trigger renewed interest across the altcoin market and usher in a wave of fresh capital. As Ethereum flirts with this breakout level, its price action in the coming days may very well set the tone for the next phase of the crypto cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month ETH Testing Resistance After 15% Surge Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading near $2,414 after rebounding sharply from the $2,100 zone, a level revisited last Sunday during heightened geopolitical tensions. The 8-hour chart shows a clean V-shaped recovery, with bulls pushing the price through the 200 SMA ($2,326), reclaiming short-term control. Volume surged on the way up, confirming strong buying interest during the bounce. However, ETH now faces a test near the $2,450\u2013$2,500 zone, where the 50 and 100 SMAs converge. These moving averages, currently acting as resistance, previously played a key role during Ethereum\u2019s consolidation in early June. A successful breakout above this range would open the door to a retest of the $2,700\u2013$2,800 levels, as suggested by top analysts like Mister Crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction For now, price action remains in a neutral consolidation range with a slight bullish tilt. If Ethereum holds above the 200 SMA while building support above $2,400, the bullish case strengthens. However, failure to break above $2,500 could trigger another pullback toward the $2,300 level. The next few sessions will be crucial to determine whether ETH continues its breakout attempt or enters another phase of sideways consolidation amid broader market uncertainty.
