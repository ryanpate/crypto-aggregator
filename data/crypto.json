      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/pepe/pepe-eyes-150-jump-to-0-000025/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Crypto Inside has provided a bullish outlook for the PEPE meme coin. The analyst predicted that it could witness a 150% surge as it looks to grab the liquidity above its current range. PEPE Eyes Rally To $0.000025 In Bid To Grab Liquidity Above In a TradingView post, Crypto Inside shared an accompanying chart in which he predicted that PEPE could jump to as high as $0.000025 following its reclaim of the $0.000010 support zone. He explained that this price surge could occur because there is currently more liquidity above than below. Related Reading: PEPE Eyes 500% Move In Pre-Breakout Retest, Can It Outperform Dogecoin? The chart showed that there is a total sell liquidity of 10,678.659 trillion around this $0.00025 range. Meanwhile, the total buy liquidity for PEPE below its current crucial support zone is 6,827.768 trillion. It is worth mentioning that a rally to $0.000025 will bring the meme coin close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00002825. Crypto Inside touched on the meme coin\u2019s liquidity depth. The analyst stated that the price moves from one liquidity to another and that this is the meme coin\u2019s fuel. He remarked that there is significantly more of this fuel accumulated at the top, alluding to the sell liquidity. The analyst added that PEPE has always been a highly speculative asset, and during prolonged one-sided movements, extremely high funding is formed in it. This, he noted, provokes sharp jumps in price. Crypto Inside also commented on the current PEPE price action. He noted that the meme coin has now reached the largest zone of interest at $00.0000817 and is trying to consolidate there. He remarked that this is a powerful level around which consolidation can be expected before further growth. However, he warned that if the PEPE price falls below it without the possibility of returning, it will be an extremely bearish signal. The Meme Coin\u2019s Narrative Is Still Strong As part of his analysis, Crypto Inside suggested that PEPE\u2019s narrative is still strong, which is why the meme coin still has a chance to reach new highs. He explained that the narrative itself is still important in meme coins and that PEPE is an \u201ceternal meme,\u201d which will live forever. He added that it is the embodiment of meme culture in the world. Related Reading: PEPE Price Confirms Phoenix Rising Pattern That Triggers 70% Surge The analyst assured market participants that there is no need to fear PEPE\u2019s oblivion. He declared that it will definitely not die as a narrative and that there is nothing to worry about. However, he admitted that new meme coins like Fartcoin have stretched liquidity across the market, and many have left PEPE for \u201cnew shiny things.\u201d At the time of writing, the PEPE price is trading at around $0.00001056, over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "summary": "According to recent data, public companies have raced ahead of Bitcoin spot ETF issuers by snapping up more than twice as much BTC in the first half of 2025. Public firms added 245,510 BTC to their balance sheets from January through June, a 375% jump over the 51,653 BTC they bought in the same stretch last year. At the same time, spot ETF issuers purchased 118,424 BTC, leaving them well behind their corporate counterparts. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Near Pain Point Last Seen In October 2024 Public Firm Purchases Smash ETF Buys According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, the 245,510 BTC bought by public companies during H1 2025 is more than four times the 118,424 BTC ETF issuers gathered. That ETF component is 56% lower than the 267,878 BTC they purchased in H1 2024, despite the funds experiencing more robust inflows than they experienced towards the end of 2024. The difference indicates increasingly companies are holding Bitcoin directly instead of relying on exchange\u2011traded products. More Companies Join Bitcoin Rush Data shows 254 entities now hold Bitcoin, and 141 of those are public companies. That marks big growth from the start of the year, when only 67 firms had BTC, and the end of March, when the number hit 79. Those counts translate to a 140% rise in six months and a nearly 80% gain in three months, underlining how many new players have jumped in. Strategy\u2019s Share Of Acquisition Dips Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) still leads corporate buyers, but its slice of the total has shrunk. In H1 2024, Strategy\u2019s purchase of 37,190 BTC made up 72% of all corporate buys. In the first half of 2025, the Michael Saylor\u2011led company purchased 135,600 BTC but now accounts for 55% of the total\u2014down from its previous dominance. Firms such as Metaplanet, GameStop and ProCap have stepped into the spotlight, each adding large sums to their Bitcoin holdings. Supply Shock Could Be Coming According to industry commentary, the increase in corporate purchasing in addition to continuing ETF demand could take a bite out of available supply. When the next halving event reduces new Bitcoin issuance, less will flow into the market. Analysts caution that increasing institutional interest and declining supply might produce a significant price response.

If that trend continues and reward for miners decreases following the halving, the battle for Bitcoin&#8217;s scarce supply could get fiercer. Investors and analysts alike will be paying close attention to how these forces influence the price of Bitcoin in the second half of 2025. Featured image from StormGain, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/buy-bitcoin-before-jackson-hole-arthur-hayes/",
      "summary": "Arthur Hayes has published a new essay, \u201cQuid Pro Stablecoin,\u201d arguing that the United States\u2019 sudden political enthusiasm for bank-issued stablecoins is less about \u201cfinancial freedom\u201d and more about arming the Treasury with a multi-trillion-dollar \u201cliquidity bazooka.\u201d The former BitMEX chief\u2014writing in his personal newsletter\u2014contends that investors who postpone buying Bitcoin until the Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing will serve as \u201cexit liquidity\u201d for those who bought earlier. How The Money Printer Is Already Warming Up At the core of Hayes\u2019 thesis is the claim that eight \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d banks hold roughly $6.8 trillion in demand and time deposits that can be transformed into on-chain dollars. Once customers migrate from legacy accounts to bank stablecoins\u2014he cites JPMorgan\u2019s forthcoming \u201cJPMD\u201d token as the template\u2014those deposits become collateral that can be recycled into Treasury bills. \u201cAdoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power,\u201d he writes, adding that the product simultaneously slashes compliance overhead because \u201can AI agent trained on the corpus of relevant compliance regulations can perfectly ensure that certain transactions are never approved.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Hayes layers a second mechanism on top of the stablecoin flow. If Congress strips the Federal Reserve of its ability to pay interest on reserve balances\u2014a proposal floated by Senator Ted Cruz\u2014banks would have to replace that lost income by buying short-dated Treasuries. He estimates the policy could \u201cliberate another $3.3 trillion of inert reserves,\u201d bringing the prospective fire-power for government debt purchases to $10.1 trillion. \u201cThis $10.1 trillion liquidity injection will act upon risky assets in the same way Bad Gurl Yellen\u2019s $2.5 trillion injection did\u2026 PUMP UP THE JAM!\u201d Hayes asserts. The essay frames the bipartisan GENIUS Act as the legislative linchpin. By barring non-banks from issuing interest-bearing stablecoins, Washington \u201chands the stablecoin market to banks,\u201d ensuring that fintech issuers such as Circle cannot compete at scale and that deposit flight is funneled into the institutions most likely to bankroll the Treasury. Hayes calculates that the cost savings and enhanced net-interest margins could increase the combined market capitalisation of the big banks by more than 180 percent, a trade he describes as \u201cnon-consensus\u201d but executable \u201cin SIZE.\u201d Buy Bitcoin Before The Fed Blinks Despite his long-term enthusiasm, Hayes cautions that a temporary liquidity drain looms once Congress passes what he labels Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill.\u201d Refilling the Treasury General Account to its $850 billion target could contract dollar liquidity by nearly half a trillion dollars, an impulse he believes may knock Bitcoin back toward the mid-$90,000s and keep prices range-bound until the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole conference in late August. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases \u201cI believe that between now and the August Jackson Hole Fed speech to be given by beta cuck towel bitch boy Jerome Powell, the market will trade sideways to slightly lower. If the TGA refill proves to be dollar liquidity negative, then the downside is $90,000 to $95,000. If the refill proves to be a nothingburger, Bitcoin will chop in the $100,000s without a decisive break above the $112,000 all-time-high,\u201d Hayes writes. The punchline, however, is resolutely bullish. Hayes ridicules advisers steering clients into bonds on the premise that yields will fall: \u201cIf you\u2019re still waiting for Powell to whisper \u2018QE infinity\u2019 in your ear before you go risk-on, congrats \u2014 you\u2019re the exit liquidity. Instead go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.\u201d In his view, the political machinery that props up US deficits has already selected bank stablecoins as the next round of stealth quantitative easing, and Bitcoin\u2014alongside JPMorgan stock\u2014is positioned to absorb the spill-over. Hayes signs off with a stark imperative: \u201cDon\u2019t sit on the sidelines waiting for Powell to bless the bull market.\u201d The liquidity horse, he argues, has already bolted; investors who hesitate to buy Bitcoin risk being trampled beneath it. \u201cYou will miss out on Bitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million,\u201d he concludes.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-surges-above-key-0-17-mark-token6900-set-to-explode/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin climbed above $109K, triggering a surge across the markets: Ethereum ($ETH) \u2013 up 4.65% XRP ($XRP) \u2013 up 3.86% Solana ($SOL) \u2013 up 7.85% Tron ($TRX) \u2013 up 4.17% But one of the biggest daily surges came from an unexpected corner, as Dogecoin mounted an 8% rally and broke the key $0.17 mark. As meme coins rebound, could the purest meme coin of them all be poised to hit the stratosphere? Time for a closer look. What\u2019s Driving the Rally? A wave of optimism around potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts, prompted by recent dovish statements from key officials, energized risk assets. Overall, markets are bullish and tokens are up for a number of reasons. Approvals of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signaled increased institutional interest, especially in altcoins. Greater clarity in US crypto regulation is drawing fresh capital into the market. Growing TradFi and DeFi convergence \u2013 including banking applications for key crypto institutions \u2013 has lowered barriers to entry while increasing a sense of trust. There\u2019s still uncertainty, especially ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s expected employment report on July 3. But for now, positivity reigns, and traders clamor for more gains. Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, noted, \u2018Bitcoin is in the passenger seat\u2026 Recent crypto ETP approvals may be raising investor confidence that TradFi capital will make its way into altcoins.\u2019 He expects new token highs later in the year, and it&#8217;s not just Bitcoin we&#8217;re talking about. Wider Market Backdrop Still Positive for Key Crypto Players US equity benchmarks like Nasdaq and the S&#38;P 500 also ticked up, with the S&#38;P 500 hitting an all-time high. However, geopolitical and fiscal uncertainties \u2013 such as the delayed U.S. budget, ongoing global trade tensions, and regional conflicts \u2013 remain a constant worry for investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows on July 1, suggesting some caution, though that was the first day in a 15-day streak of inflows. Ripple\u2019s application for a national bank charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) marked another sign of growing institutional integration. And President Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement of a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal may boost broader risk-on sentiment. All told, it\u2019s no surprise that Dogecoin made a strong push \u2013 and could be forming the base for another surge to $0.19 or beyond. A strong performance from the world\u2019s biggest meme coin creates a favorable environment for the purest, simplest, strongest meme coin presale \u2013 Token6900 ($T6900). Token6900 ($T6900) \u2013 All Meme, All the Time First there was the SPX6900 token, a meme with no utility, just a $1.2B market cap. It\u2019s up 4.3% in the past week, kicking butt and taking names. Now there\u2019s Token6900 ($T6900), with even less utility but more&#8230;tokens? Yes, it has one more token than SPX6900. Talk about pettiness, right? The project is pure meme coin madness, all mood and all vibe. And it\u2019s all potential, too \u2013 the potential to ride the growing meme market to unprecedented heights. The truth of $T6900 is that it isn\u2019t just another meme coin \u2013 it\u2019s the most literal meme coin possible. The truth is the meme, and the meme is truth. There\u2019s no hiding, no fancy promises of future utility \u2013 just a meme, a presale, and slaptastic potential. True meme coin aficionados are already buying in; the presale has raised over $191K in a matter of days, with tokens priced at only $0.006425. Visit the Token6900 presale page to learn more. Memes Ready to Make Bank in Bullish Markets Crypto markets are currently buoyed by encouraging macro signals, institutional momentum, and regulatory progress. While underlying uncertainties persist, the prevailing sentiment leans toward upside \u2013 and Token6900 taps into that outlook to unleash pure meme coin momentum. Do your own research \u2013 this isn\u2019t financial advice."
