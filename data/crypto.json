      "summary": "Tom Lee, Fundstrat\u2019s head of research, says Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 by the end of 2025. According to an interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box today, Lee pointed out that Bitcoin recently dipped from its all-time high of $111,970 down to about $104,000. He still thinks that the market is holding up around that level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Max Keiser Isn\u2019t Buying The Hype Around New Crypto Holding Companies Lee\u2019s Short-Term Outlook Lee told Squawk Box\u2019s host Joe Kernen that 95% of all Bitcoin\u2014about 19.80 million coins\u2014has already been mined out of a maximum of 21 million. That leaves roughly 1.13 million coins waiting to be produced. He sees that as a tight supply setup. He also noted that while nearly all Bitcoin exists, 95% of the global population does not own any. Based on reports, that gap between supply and potential buyers could push prices higher in the months ahead. To reach $250,000 from around $104,000 now, Bitcoin would need to jump about 140%. Lee still believes it can hit $150,000 by December and could even stretch toward $200,000 to $250,000 if demand heats up. Supply And Demand Gap Lee highlighted the fact that most people in the world have not bought any Bitcoin. He said this creates an imbalance. On one side you have a nearly fixed supply. On the other, there may be millions of new buyers in the next 10 years. He explained that if even a fraction of those people decide to buy Bitcoin, the price could move a lot higher. Right now, only about 5% of all coins remain to be mined. That means new supply is slowing down fast. At the same time, more wallets, apps, and easy ways to buy could bring in fresh money. Lee thinks this mismatch is a big part of why Bitcoin could keep climbing. Long-Term Valuation Targets When asked about Bitcoin\u2019s terminal value\u2014meaning its price when all coins are mined by 2140\u2014Lee said he expects it to match gold\u2019s roughly $23 trillion market cap. That works out to at least $1.15 million per Bitcoin if there are 20 million coins in circulation. He chose 20 million instead of 21 million because assumed losses (lost keys, forgotten wallets) mean not every coin will ever be spent. Lee went further, saying he sees room for Bitcoin to hit $2 million or $3 million per coin. That would put his average \u201cbull case\u201d at $2.5 million, which is roughly a 2,300% rise from today\u2019s levels. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Other Analyst Projections VanEck\u2019s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, also has a long-range prediction. Based on what Sigel told investors, VanEck sees Bitcoin hitting $3 million by 2050. That forecast lines up with Lee\u2019s idea of Bitcoin matching or even beating gold over time. Both calls assume steady growth in demand, plus wider use by big institutions like hedge funds or pension plans. Featured image from Gemini, chart from TradingView"

Notably, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price action has seen a volatile movement over the past week. After briefly rallying above $2.65 earlier in May, XRP failed to sustain its momentum, instead trending downwards until it rebounded at $2.10 on the last day of May. Amid this backdrop of price action, there have been discussions around the timing for the next major price movement for XRP. A fresh outlook by a crypto analyst suggests XRP investors should pay attention to June 3 to June 6. Crypto Analyst Predicts Timeline For XRP Bottom And Breakout A crypto analyst known pseudonymously as WatersAbove has drawn attention to specific calendar dates that could play important roles in XRP\u2019s short-term and long-term price trajectories. Taking to the social media platform X to share his outlook, the analyst suggested that June 4th to 6th could mark the bottom for XRP before there is any significant upside.

      "summary": "A surge of stablecoin transactions marked May as a standout month for the crypto sector. It moved beyond mere token swaps. Lots of people and services turned to dollar-pegged coins for moving value. Activity hit fresh highs, hinting that stablecoins are now the main channel for on-chain payments. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Spike In Wallet Activity According to Artemis data, more than 33 million wallets sent or received stablecoins during May. That\u2019s a big jump compared with earlier months. It shows more folks are leaning on these digital dollars than on native tokens. Many traders, DeFi users, and everyday people tapped stablecoins to keep their funds tied to the US dollar. This wave of usage also came as the wider market showed signs of life, with prices slowly rising and confidence climbing. Shift To Faster Networks Based on reports, BNB Smart Chain counted over 10 million active wallets for stablecoin moves early in May. TRON came very close, with a little over 9 million wallets during that same stretch. These two networks are cheap and quick. Folks want to dodge higher fees on older chains. By month\u2019s end, both BNB Smart Chain and TRON could top those numbers again. That trend speaks to growing demand for fast, low-cost payments and DeFi deals. Ethereum simply can\u2019t match these lower fees right now. Stablecoin Supply Growth Stablecoins also saw more tokens enter circulation. The total supply grew to $244 billion, up nearly 3% in just one month. But not all coins minted equally. Tether\u2019s USDT remained the heavyweight champion. It added nearly $4 billion to its total supply in May alone. Most of that new USDT landed on TRON. Today, TRON holds nearly $78 billion in USDT, while Ethereum carries $73 billion. In sum, USDT\u2019s overall supply now tops $153 billion and added tokens almost every day. USDC moved in the opposite direction. Its supply dipped slightly, thanks to outflows on Solana. Still, USDC keeps about $60 billion circulating across all its chains. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump\u2019s Feed\u2014Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? Payments And Bridges Overtake Cards Stablecoins didn\u2019t just grow in supply and usage. They carried huge volumes of payments.

For example, Visa\u2019s volumes were lower than what stablecoins saw. Plus, USDC\u2019s cross-chain moves spiked. The CCTP bridge saw $7.7 billion flow through it, up 83% month-on-month. That rush of bridging means more people are shuttling dollars between networks for trades, lending, or simple transfers. Featured image from ETF Stream, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-sell-off-rumor-ripple-war-chest/",
      "summary": "CoinRoutes chief executive Dave Weisberger detonated a fresh round of anxiety in the XRP market on Monday when he asked, on Scott Melker\u2019s podcast, whether Ripple Labs could finance a takeover of Circle \u201cfor $10 to $20 billion\u201d without off-loading roughly $10 billion in XRP. \u201cWho\u2019s going to buy the $10 billion worth of XRP they would need to sell out of their treasury?\u201d Weisberger said, warning that a sudden supply surge could overwhelm order books and \u201chammer the price.\u201d Is A XRP Sell-Off Conceivable? Within hours, pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli fired back on X. \u201cI love @daveweisberger1, but on this point he is mcgloning so hard,\u201d he wrote, invoking Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone\u2019s reputation for bearish hyperbole. \u201cJust based on what I\u2019m getting offered for my Ripple shares on the secondary market, I don\u2019t think Ripple would even have to sell one XRP to buy Circle.\u201d Rispoli agreed that Ripple cannot raise $10 billion in pure cash, yet insisted the company could \u201ceasily afford the acquisition for a mix of cash and debt\u201d and a heavy equity-swap. Related Reading: $3 XRP Dream Delayed\u2014No Bull Run Before November, Says Top Analyst When Weisberger replied that Circle\u2019s board would likely demand hard dollars unless it accepted Ripple equity or XRP \u201cwithout a haircut,\u201d Rispoli dug in. \u201cNo way to get $10B in cash\u2014and $10B is too high anyway,\u201d he wrote, citing late-2024 private-research valuations that placed Ripple at $15 billion excluding its ~36 billion escrowed XRP. If Circle\u2019s price tag fell to $7\u20139 billion, he said, Ripple could close with \u201c$1\u20133 billion cash on hand, a heavy stock exchange, and debt,\u201d especially with \u201call that GCC money sloshing around crypto world right now.\u201d Rispoli conceded it would be \u201ca reach\u201d but \u201cdoable without meaningfully selling XRP.\u201d Weisberger acknowledged the math\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable analysis,\u201d he wrote\u2014yet cautioned that any price at the upper end of Rispoli\u2019s range \u201ccould be some short-term pain for us XRP holders.\u201d Ripple\u2019s tender-offer buyback in January 2024 valued the company at $11.3 billion, disclosing more than $1 billion in cash and about $25 billion in digital assets\u2014mostly XRP\u2014on its books. The firm still controls roughly 52 billion XRP (about 40 percent of supply), though 36 billion sit in timed escrow releases, limiting immediate access. At today\u2019s $2.20 spot price, the spendable portion is worth a little under $35 billion, but moving even a fraction quickly would collide with thin venue depth\u2014a point Weisberger hammered home. Related Reading: Wave Count Analysis Reveals The XRP Price Trigger Point For Take-Off Ripple\u2019s cash pile also shrank after its $1.25 billion purchase of prime broker Hidden Road in April, a deal settled with a blend of cash, equity and RLUSD stablecoins. That acquisition suggests the company prefers hybrid structures, bolstering Rispoli\u2019s claim that Treasury XRP need not flood the market. Is Circle Even For Sale? The debate may be academic. Circle, issuer of USDC, has repeatedly declared it \u201cnot for sale\u201d while marching toward a New York Stock Exchange listing that now targets a $7.2 billion valuation. Ripple\u2019s rumored approach earlier this spring reportedly topped $5 billion, well below Weisberger\u2019s stress case and within Rispoli\u2019s \u201cdoable\u201d band, but Circle rebuffed the talks and updated its S-1 two weeks later, enlarging the float rather than seeking a buyer. Strategically, Ripple already fields its own dollar-token RLUSD, launched in January and positioned by president Monica Long as \u201ccomplementary to XRP, not a competitor.\u201d Absorbing USDC\u2019s issuer would instantly rocket Ripple towards the size of Tether. Even under Rispoli\u2019s optimistic structure, Ripple might still need to liquidate several hundred million dollars\u2019 worth of XRP for working capital and closing costs. At current volumes, unloading just 500 million XRP (\u2248 $1.1 billion) would equal half a week of global turnover\u2014enough to distort price unless executed as private blocks. At press time, XRP traded at $2.19. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price crash is in focus following the flagship crypto\u2019s recent drop to as low as $103,700. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik has commented on why $107,500 and $103,500 are the most important levels to watch as BTC looks to decide its next move. Why $107,500 &#38; $103,500 Are Key For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Captain Faibik explained that $107,500 and $103,500 are key as the bulls and bears battle to dictate the next move for the Bitcoin price. The analyst noted that later this week, BTC bulls will attempt to reclaim the $107,500 resistance and regain momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Break Down To $92,000 As It Enters Accumulation Phase He predicted that a clean break and hold above $107,500 could trigger a bullish leg toward the $117,000 level, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, on the other hand, $103,500 is an important support level which the bulls must defend as the Bitcoin price eyes new highs. Captain Faibik warned that a breakdown below could shift momentum back in favor of the bears. The Bitcoin price had surged above $106,000 on May 2 following news about the US decision to extend its pause of tariffs on some Chinese goods to August. This provided a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto after Donald Trump stated last week that China had violated the trade deal with the US. Trump and China\u2019s president are set to have a call later this week, which could further boost the Bitcoin price if both sides could resolve any dispute regarding the current trade deal. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell failed to discuss the economy during his speech at the International Finance Division Anniversary Conference, which also continues to fuel market uncertainty. First Step For BTC Is To Get Back Above $106,500 In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital indicated that the first step is for the Bitcoin price to successfully reclaim $106,500. He noted that BTC had recorded a weekly close below this level, which puts the flagship crypto back in the danger zone. The analyst further remarked that BTC needs to get back above this level in the coming days or things can get \u201csketchy looking.\u201d Kevin Capital added that this has been a key level for months, and nothing has changed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rise To $111,000 ATH Doesn\u2019t Mean The Market Is Bullish, Certified Expert Says Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto revealed that a Katana is forming on the weekly chart for the Bitcoin price. He explained that in Ichimoku analysis, a Katana forms when Tenkan and Kijun overlap. This signals low momentum and market equilibrium. He added that this development also precedes strong directional moves, with an expansion or pullback on the horizon. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,435, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
