      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-dont-send-it-too-hard-analyst/",
      "summary": "The news that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump may have marked the bottom for the Dogecoin price. Via X, independent chartist Maelius (@MaeliusCrypto) uploaded a weekly DOGE/USDT study that he believes is tracing an unusually clean, nested 1-2, 1-2 \u201cspring-loaded\u201d Elliott set-up \u2013 the kind of formation that often precedes an outsized third-wave rally. \u201cDOGE \u2026 Market makers, please, don\u2019t send it too hard,\u201d the analyst joked on 23 June, imploring liquidity desks to let the structure mature before unleashing volatility. Dogecoin Ready To Explode? In Maelius\u2019 count, the second of the two minor wave-twos ended last week when price tagged $0.142 and immediately snapped higher. That inflection, visible on his chart as the tip of a long lower wick, occurred exactly where the 200-week exponential moving average ($0.142) intersects a rising support trend-line that has tracked Dogecoin since late-2023 \u2013 a textbook area for long-term money to defend. The bounce printed on Sunday\u2019s weekly close, giving technicians a hard reference point for risk. If the wave map is correct, the composite third wave that now follows could push into the $1.10\u2013$1.30 corridor, Maelius annotates. A fourth-wave pause somewhere near $0.60 would then reset oscillators before a terminal fifth wave above $1.60 completes the cycle. While the analyst stops short of publishing time targets, the price levels are etched in full on the chart, making the roadmap unambiguous. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target Underlying demand is also drawn into the picture. A broad green rectangle labelled \u201cDEMAND\u201d spans roughly $0.12\u2013$0.17. Last week\u2019s wick once again penetrated that zone before reversing, adding statistical weight to its importance. At the bottom of Maelius\u2019 chart lies the WaveTrend Oscillator (WTO), comprising a fast line (WT1), a slow line (WT2) and a histogram that plots their spread. The analyst shades the band between about \u201360 and \u201330 in green to denote the oversold floor. Both momentum lines double-bottomed in that zone in autumn 2024 and April this year, immediately before price rocketed higher. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $4 Dogecoin After Exhausted Selling Phase As of Sunday\u2019s close WT1 prints \u201318.49 and WT2 \u201333.21, with the histogram at \u201322.80. In other words, momentum is cooling but could be reversing as it is touching Maelius\u2019 bottom zone as in previous instances. Sceptics note that a nested 1-2 count can fail if price undercuts the second wave-two, and that liquidity-driven memecoins are intrinsically prone to whipsaw. Even Maelius tempered his enthusiasm in a follow-up exchange when a follower warned of a \u201cchoppy summer,\u201d replying: \u201cWe are almost in July bro, one or two months of chop not changing anything if [it] happens.\u201d For now the battleground is clear: as long as Dogecoin holds above the converging 200-week EMA\u2013trend-line nexus and the upper rim of the demand zone, the wave thesis remains intact and the next directional verdict will belong to the market rather than the meme. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1634, up 17% since the bottom on Sunday. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-repeat-of-2021/",
      "summary": "Ethereum saw a notable decline in its price over the last week, and the weekend culmination pulled the price back towards levels not seen in over one month. The movement tracks with the established bearish trend of the month of June and continues to show mounting sell pressure on the cryptocurrency. However, with this decline has emerged a trend similar to what was seen back in 2021, right before the market picked up and saw the beginning of the altcoin season. Ethereum Price Crash Similar To 2021 Looking at the current Ethereum price action and that of what was seen back in Q2 2021, there have been some striking similarities. Most especially, how the Ethereum price has performed in the month of June so far has been the same as what happened back in June 2021. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens In 2021, the Ethereum price began the month of June trading above $2,600. However, as the month went on, the altcoin suffered multiple declines and crashed below $2,000 before it was over. Eventually, the price would find its bottom somewhere around $1,600 before the decline was over. Fast forward four years to the year 2025, and the month of June is showing the same trend. June 2025 had begun with the Ethereum price trending above $2,600 before the bears took control. Since then, the altcoin has crashed by more than 20%, and looks primed for more. Using the historical performance, it would suggest that the Ethereum price decline is far from over. If there is a repeat of June 2021, then Ethereum could suffer another 20% crash before the month of June is over, to find its bottom somewhere between $1,600 and $1,700. The Trigger For Altcoin Season Given that Ethereum is the largest altcoin in the market, it is naturally the trigger for the altcoin season. Looking back on 2021, the altcoin season began when the Ethereum price began to rally. But the recovery did not begin until the month of July, and eventually lasted into the month of November.

This is expected to trigger a market rally for risk assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the fact that a resolution to the Iran-Israel war could be in the works. If this trend holds, then it is possible that the Ethereum price would begin to rally in July. As seen in 2021, Ethereum would end up rising over 200% in the course of five months, to put in a new all-time high in the month of November. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-zone-markets-next-true-pivot-glassnode/",
      "summary": "The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted the $97,000 to $98,000 zone as an important one for Bitcoin. Here&#8217;s why. Bitcoin CBD Suggests Build Up Of Supply In This Range In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about a potentially significant zone for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) is an indicator that measures the amount of the BTC supply that investors last purchased or transferred at the various price levels. As is visible in the above graph, there is a dense supply zone located between $97,000 to $98,000. Generally, investors are quite sensitive to retests of their cost basis, so a large amount of them (or alternatively, a few large holders) having their acquisition level inside a narrow range could make retests of it significant for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss When the mood in the market is bullish, holders can react to retests of their cost basis from above by buying more. They may do so believing that the same level would end up proving profitable again in the future and the retrace is just a &#8216;dip.&#8217; The cryptocurrency suffered a plunge yesterday and nearly touched this region. Since then, however, things have turned around for the asset and it has gained some distance over it once more. In the event that the decline does continue, which may not be too unexpected given the volatile geopolitical situation at the moment, the zone could end up acting as the next true pivot for Bitcoin, according to the analytics firm. While the CBD tells us where the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply is concentrated, it doesn&#8217;t contain any information about who bought or sold at those price levels. Glassnode&#8217;s behavioral cohorts, investor groups divided on the basis of their behavior, solve this problem. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by these holder cohorts over the past few years: There are five of these behavior groups. First Buyers (green) include the investors who are buying Bitcoin for the very first time. As displayed in the chart, the supply of this group has been on the rise, indicating fresh demand has been coming in. Momentum Buyers (blue) are those that capitalize on market momentum by buying during uptrends. On the opposite spectrum are the Conviction Buyers (purple), who buy despite falling prices. Finally, there are the Loss Sellers (red) and Profit Takers (yellow), who correspond to investors exiting at a loss and profit, respectively. During the past couple of weeks, the former cohort has seen an increase of 29%, a sign that weak hands have been capitulating. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy That said, the analytics firm has noted, &#8220;Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn\u2019t collapsing. Some are cutting losses &#8211; others are actively lowering their cost basis.&#8221; BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,900, down more than 4% in the last seven days.

      "summary": "BNB price is gaining pace above the $632 support zone. The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $600 support zone. The price is now trading below $632 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $632 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Gains After forming a base above the $600 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $620 and $625 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $651 swing high to the $602 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $632 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $651 swing high to the $602 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $644 level. The next resistance sits near the $650 level. A clear move above the $650 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $665. A close above the $665 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $644 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $635 level. The next major support is near the $632 level. The main support sits at $625. If there is a downside break below the $625 support, the price could drop toward the $612 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $600 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels \u2013 $632 and $625. Major Resistance Levels \u2013 $644 and $650."
