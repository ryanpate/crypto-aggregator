      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-battles-key-support-daily-ema-100-must-hold-to-prevent-deep-correction/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin briefly fell below the critical $100,000 level over the weekend, reaching a low of approximately $98,200 and triggering a wave of panic selling across crypto markets. The sharp drop came after news broke of US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move that significantly escalated the already volatile conflict between Israel and Iran. The geopolitical shock sent global markets into risk-off mode, with Bitcoin reacting quickly to the growing uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure \u2013 Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 Despite the weekend dip, BTC has since reclaimed the $100K mark, but sentiment remains fragile. Investors are now watching key technical levels closely to determine the next move. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Bitcoin must hold the daily EMA-100 to avoid further downside pressure. A decisive close below this level could open the door for a deeper correction, especially if macroeconomic and geopolitical risks persist. As volatility spikes and fear grows, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to maintain support at these levels may define whether the bull cycle continues or enters a prolonged consolidation phase. All eyes are now on the $100K zone, which has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears in a market driven by both technicals and global tension. Bulls Defend $100K As Dominance Rises and Market Faces Crucial Test Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal moment. After dipping below the psychological $100,000 level over the weekend amid growing geopolitical tensions, BTC quickly reclaimed this critical threshold, offering a glimmer of hope to market participants. Although bulls managed to push the price back up, the overall structure remains fragile, and technical indicators now carry more weight than ever. Ted Pillows noted in a recent update that Bitcoin must hold its daily EMA-100 to preserve bullish momentum. A daily close below $99,000 would confirm a break below this key support zone, likely triggering a retest of the $92,000\u2013$94,000 region. Such a move could create significant downside pressure, particularly on altcoins, which are already lagging behind in performance. In Pillows&#8217; words, \u201cIf Bitcoin loses this level, alts will be annihilated.\u201d Despite the looming risks, fundamentals remain solid. Bitcoin dominance continues to hover near its highest levels of the year, reflecting growing investor preference for BTC over high-beta assets during uncertain times. On-chain metrics still indicate strong holder conviction, and macro narratives continue to favor Bitcoin as a hedge amid fiat instability and rising geopolitical uncertainty. If Bitcoin can hold the $100K level and reclaim momentum, it could lead to renewed strength and eventually a push toward the $109K resistance zone. For now, however, bulls are on the defensive. Price action over the next few days will likely define the trajectory for the remainder of Q3, with a close watch on EMA support, macro headlines, and risk sentiment across global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Chart Nears Tower Top Formation As US Launches Attack On Iran \u2013 Details Bitcoin Struggles Below Resistance Amid Bearish Price Structure The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin reveals a bearish structure following the breakdown below the $103,600 support zone. After forming a symmetrical triangle throughout mid-June, BTC failed to break upward and instead reversed direction, confirming a downward breakout. This move triggered a sharp decline to $98,200 over the weekend, followed by a modest recovery to the current $101,250 level. The price is now trading below both the 50 and 100-period simple moving averages, which are beginning to curl downward, signaling a shift in momentum away from bulls. The 200-period SMA, currently near $95,600, stands as the next major support if downside pressure continues. Volume has picked up notably on the red candles, adding weight to the bearish case and confirming active selling during the recent drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move Bitcoin must reclaim the $103,600 zone and hold above it to invalidate the bearish pattern and regain control. Failure to do so could result in further downside toward $95,000 and possibly even $92,000. As long as BTC remains below the broken triangle support and the $103K resistance, the path of least resistance remains downward. Bulls face an uphill battle, and confidence may erode quickly if the $100K psychological level is breached again. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "The Bitcoin dominance has hit a new cycle high, providing a bearish outlook for altcoins and any potential altcoin season. Crypto analyst Finsends has commented on this development and how it could affect the altcoin season moving forward. What\u2019s Next As Bitcoin Dominance Hits New High? In an X post, Finsends stated that the Bitcoin dominance has made a new high and that it feels like it can never go down again. However, he opined that there should be a bigger correction starting somewhere around the current levels. The analyst added that the potential target area for a top in this scenario goes up to 68.56%. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here\u2019s Why His accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin dominance could hit this projected top of 68.56% in July, after which a decline would begin. Based on the chart, the BTC.D could drop to as low as 48% on this decline, paving the way for a potential altcoin season. If so, then altcoins could witness significant gains in the second half of the year and outperform BTC in the process. In an X post, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe also commented on the rising Bitcoin dominance and a potential altcoin season. He noted that the altcoin season indicator has hit its lowest number in two years. The analyst added that the lows of this indicator over the last six years were in June or July. Based on this, he remarked that there seems to be a pattern since the indicator has hit a low again this June. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe didn\u2019t predict when exactly altcoin season could begin or if the Bitcoin dominance would top anytime soon. However, before now, he had expressed confidence that the alt season would still happen. The analyst noted that the last cycle was also called a Bitcoin cycle until altcoins started to run and heavily outperformed. What Needs To Happen For Altcoins To Take Off In another X post, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stated that altcoins are in need of an upward push from Ethereum, and that this needs to happen through a push of Bitcoin. He further remarked that once the BTC price bottoms out, that is a very likely moment for Ethereum to continue outperforming the flagship crypto, with the Bitcoin dominance declining. Related Reading: Analyst Calls Start Of Altcoin Season Amid Deviation Of Cyclical Lows \u2013 Details The analyst believes that altcoins would start \u201cshining\u201d when the next leg upwards for Ethereum takes place, possibly ushering in altcoin season.

However, for now, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes investors need to have some more patience.

That metric tracks Bitcoin per fully diluted share, so it puts the firm\u2019s strategy under a clear spotlight. Based on reports, the company gained 4,367 BTC valued at $451 million in this period, using prices from Bitflyer. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,111 $BTC, Total Holdings Reach 11,111 BTC* pic.twitter.com/7ceEeSh1X4 \u2014 Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Balance Sheet Swells to 11,111 BTC With the new purchase, Metaplanet\u2019s total stash now stands at 11,111 BTC, worth just over $1.07 billion. Its cost basis for those coins sits at about $95,869 each. Metaplanet\u2019s shares dipped 3.5% on the day of the announcement, a sign that investors may be worried about how the firm is funding its buy-ups. Source: Metaplanet Funding Through Bonds And Shares Based on reports, the company has raised cash via zero-coupon bonds and equity rights since January. It issued over 210 million shares under a program it calls the \u201c210 Million Plan.\u201d Evo Fund has snapped up many of those bonds and rights. Between May and June 2025, Metaplanet pulled in over $300 million, earmarking every dollar for more Bitcoin. Ambitious Target Of 210,000 BTC Metaplanet has set a goal to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That is 10 times its current pile. To reach that number, it will need to keep tapping the capital markets\u2014and it plans to. The firm even created a dedicated Bitcoin Treasury Operations arm in December 2024, moving away from its hotel management roots. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Dilution And Risk For Shareholders Metaplanet\u2019s fully diluted share count rose to close to 760 million as of June 23. That puts its Bitcoin per 1,000 shares at 0.0146 BTC. More bonds and shares mean more dilution for existing investors. If Bitcoin\u2019s price slips, the cost of raising money could climb, eating into any gains from the crypto itself. Metaplanet\u2019s approach mirrors what some other big holders have done. It\u2019s a bold stance. If Bitcoin holds up or heads higher, the firm could see big returns. But it will need to balance fresh capital raises against the risk of pushing down its own stock. For now, Metaplanet shows no sign of slowing down its Bitcoin buying. The only real question is how far this strategy can run before the bills come due.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-critical-support-2350-level-could-define-the-next-move/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has dropped 17% since Friday, breaking down from the long-standing range that held firm since early May. The sharp sell-off came after news broke of US airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, sending shockwaves across global markets and sparking panic selling in risk assets. ETH was no exception, plunging below multiple support zones before finding a temporary floor at $2,100. Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure \u2013 Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This level served as a critical demand area, and Ethereum has since managed to bounce, offering bulls a glimmer of hope in an otherwise uncertain market. However, the breakdown of the previous trading range indicates that momentum has clearly shifted in favor of the bears. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum must reclaim the top of the former range to signal that the downside move was a deviation rather than a full breakdown. As investors digest the growing geopolitical risk and continue to react to macroeconomic pressures such as persistent inflation and hawkish Federal Reserve policy, Ethereum\u2019s path forward remains uncertain. Still, the bounce from $2,100 provides a chance for bulls to reestablish control\u2014if they can push the price back above key resistance levels in the sessions ahead. Ethereum Holds Support But Bears Still in Control Recent price action has taken a heavy toll on altcoins, with Ethereum leading the downturn as most assets fall to lower demand levels. Since reaching its early June high, Ethereum has shed over 26% of its value, now trading under intense bearish pressure. Despite the decline, bulls have managed to defend the critical $2,100 support level, providing a temporary floor in an otherwise fragile environment. Geopolitical instability\u2014particularly the escalating conflict between the US, Israel, and Iran\u2014continues to add volatility and risk aversion to the market. Investors remain cautious, with the broader macroeconomic backdrop dominated by high US Treasury yields, stubborn inflation, and a hawkish Federal Reserve. These factors have put additional weight on the crypto sector, especially on Ethereum, which is widely seen as the main catalyst for a potential altseason that has yet to materialize. Ted Pillows notes that Ethereum recently tested the $2,100 support and successfully bounced. However, he emphasizes that the price must reclaim the top of its previous range to regain bullish momentum. If ETH fails to break and hold above the $2,350 range low, it risks a deeper move toward the start of the previous impulse leg\u2014or worse. The coming days will be critical for Ethereum. Reclaiming lost levels would indicate strength and possibly kick off the long-awaited altcoin rotation. But continued rejection could signal more downside ahead, with sentiment already fragile and demand still lacking. Until clarity returns, Ethereum remains in a decisive phase where every candle matters. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Chart Nears Tower Top Formation As US Launches Attack On Iran \u2013 Details ETH Price Analysis: Breakdown Below Key Structure Ethereum (ETH) has sharply declined, with the price now sitting around $2,248. This move marks a confirmed breakdown from the key range between $2,320 and $2,850, which had been holding since early May. The rejection from the upper resistance zone near $2,850, combined with high-volume selling, indicates clear bearish momentum. The current candle structure on the 3-day timeframe shows strong downward pressure, especially as ETH failed to hold above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (currently at $2,638 and $2,776, respectively). These levels now act as dynamic resistance, adding more weight against any short-term bullish reversal attempts. ETH is also trading well below the 50-day moving average at $2,265, a level that has historically acted as a short-term directional signal. Unless price reclaims and consolidates above that zone, the bearish trend could continue toward the $2,000\u2013$2,100 support cluster\u2014an area that previously sparked buying interest during March&#8217;s recovery. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates Volume has spiked significantly on this drop, suggesting panic selling rather than a controlled correction. For bulls to regain control, ETH must reclaim the range low at $2,320 quickly. Otherwise, downside pressure could continue to dominate in the near term.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-cycle-high-at-20-30/",
      "summary": "The XRP price could be preparing for a historical rally, as a prominent crypto analyst has boldly predicted that the cryptocurrency could reach a fresh cycle top between $20 and $30. The forecast, which presents a massive upside for the altcoin, is based on the Elliott Wave Theory\u2014a key technical analysis tool. XRP Wave Map Signals Cycle Top Ahead Crypto analyst, XForceGlobal on X (formerly Twitter) has presented a bold new forecast for XRP, projecting a cycle high between $20 and $30. The analyst shared a chart that dissects XRP\u2019s price action over the last several months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is currently in the final stages of a corrective wave before beginning a powerful multi-leg impulsive rally. If this wave count plays out as the market expert says, XRP could be on the verge of its most aggressive breakout to date. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $3.61 In Short Term As \u2018Cup\u2019 Turns Hot The analysis focuses on XRP\u2019s medium-term correction, which has taken the form of a complex WXY structure. According to the chart, XRP is nearing the completion of Wave 2, a corrective phase that began after the last upward impulse. XForceGlobal has pinpointed a key Fibonacci confluence zone between $1.60 and $1.90, where XRP\u2019s pullback is expected to find support. The chart clearly marks this area as a potential springboard for the next bullish phase, as long as the price does not fall below the $1.618 level, which serves as the invalidation point for the current setup. Despite XRP\u2019s historical track record of sluggish performance and ongoing skepticism within the crypto community about the bullish forecast, XForceGlobal maintains confidence that the cryptocurrency will reach the ambitious $20-$30 cycle top\u2014a move he believes could unfold well into 2026. Intermediate Targets First, Cycle High Later According to XForceGlobal\u2019s chart, once XRP completes its current corrective move, the analyst predicts that the first leg of this upcoming rally may take the cryptocurrency past the $5 mark in Wave 3, followed by a deeper Wave 4 pullback and a final thrust into Wave 5 toward $6 or more. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 While these targets represent an intermediate-term bullish setup, on a macro scale, the long-term wave map implies that the whole structure could later culminate in a parabolic cycle top rally that sends XRP between $20 and possibly even $30. This optimistic outlook gains further credibility, as the analyst notes that XRP\u2019s internal wave count for the flat scenario has taken longer to resolve than initially expected. Beyond technicals, XForceGlobal highlights that market psychology plays a central role in its bullish forecast. He notes that the XRP community has weathered regulatory battles, market crashes, and years of stagnation, most notably the US SEC lawsuit. This prolonged adversity has turned XRP holders into \u201cbattle-tested veterans\u201d who are largely immune to fear-driven selling. This resilience, according to the analyst, could be the key to the next bullish phase of XRP\u2019s price action. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"
