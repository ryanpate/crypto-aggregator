      "summary": "The bull market may be taking longer than expected to kick into its final gear, but the Bitcoin price structure remains bullish and steadily climbing within a rising trend channel. However, the potential upper targets have also moved higher, and might open the door to unprecedented price levels in the weeks ahead. Why The Bull Market Delay Might Be Good News Global uncertainties have delayed the second and possibly final phase of the current bull market in cryptocurrencies. According to master kenobi&#8217;s post on X, he noted that these delays may end up working in our favor. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO While Bitcoin and altcoins have remained within the boundaries of an ascending trend channel, the upper and lower limits of this channel are steadily rising, and showing resilience in market structure despite the external hesitation. If the second phase of the bull market ignited in April, projections suggest that the BTC upper limit might have topped out between $134,000 and $155,000. However, as this didn\u2019t happen, the upper limit has continued to climb, and if the 50-day pump pattern holds, the upper limit could be reached around August 11, at a range of $169,000 and $197,000. Naturally, this requires relative global stability. &#8220;Let\u2019s hope for another 30 days of calm, as 20 days have already passed,&#8221; the analyst added. Why Bitcoin Surge Is A Market-Wide Trigger In an X post, Davie Satoshi also mentioned that Bitcoin is on the verge of something big, that BTC is hovering in the middle of a multi-year bullish channel. It has been marked by long-standing green trendlines, and has just broken through the resistance level, which is indicated by a blue dotted horizontal line that has capped upside momentum until now.

The analyst stated that a rising tide lifts all boats, and that Bitcoin has always been the bellwether of the crypto market. They also suggest that BTC price could surge toward $180,000 to $200,000, with a potential top forming around late August to September, which will be followed by alt season and peaking in Q4 2025 to Q1 2026.

This came as the analyst noted that the altcoin is already on the move, having recorded a 20% gain since its breakout. XRP Train Already On The Move To ATHs In an X post, Captain Faibik stated that the XRP train has already departed, with a rally to all-time highs on the horizon. The analyst noted that the altcoin has already surged over 20% since its breakout above $2.3. He had earlier predicted that the token was on the verge of a breakout, which would send it above its current ATH of $3.84. Related Reading: XRP Wave 3 Could Repeat 600% Surge From Nov 2025, Target Set For $15 Captain Faibik remarked that this bullish rally will send XRP to as high as $4.60. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto also indicated that a new ATH is in sight for the altcoin. In an X post, He stated that XRP needs to close the $3-day candle above the top wick of the March 2nd candle. The analyst told market participants to get ready for a new ATH if it closes above the $3.010 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also echoed Captain Faibik\u2019s sentiments, stating that XRP has just recorded a powerful breakout. He noted that the altcoin has confirmed a clean breakout from the multi-month descending triangle and revealed that the target is $3.80. This brings XRP to its ATH, which could pave the way for new highs. XRP boasts a bullish outlook, given its breakout from the crucial $2.30 support level that Captain Faibik and Titan of Crypto highlighted. The altcoin is now looking to reclaim the psychological $3 level, which would bring it close to its yearly high of $3.29. Momentum Is Off The Charts In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades declared that XRP\u2019s momentum is off the charts. She noted that Relative Strength Index (RSI) divergences are being \u201cobliterated\u201d as bulls remain in full control.

Her accompanying chart showed that a clean break above this Fib level could send XRP to $3.4, which is the next major resistance after $3.04. A rally to this level would put its ATH well in sight.

      "summary": "Bitcoin rose above the $122,000 mark on Monday. According to data from CoinGecko, prices briefly topped that level before pulling back slightly. The jump comes in the face of strong inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional interest. Traders watched as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap set yet another record. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Awaits The Next Bitcoin Sale: \u2018My Fellow Pigs And I Are Feasting\u2019 Bitcoin ETFs Explode Based on reports, Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.20 billion flow in on Thursday alone. That was the biggest single\u2011day haul of 2025. Last week, QCP Capital said institutional flows into spot BTC ETFs topped $2 billion. These numbers suggest big players are betting on more upside. Open interest on futures now exceeds $43 billion. Funding rates on perpetual contracts are climbing too, showing crowded long positions. US President Donald Trump has voiced his support for clearer crypto rules. And on Monday, the US House of Representatives began debating a package of crypto bills aimed at giving firms more certainty. Companies have been adding bitcoin to their treasuries, with some corporate holdings rising by double\u2011digit percentages this year. According to BTSE COO Jeff Mei, longer\u2011term institutional buyers are driving prices higher. He forecasted that bitcoin could hit $125K \u201cin the next month or two.\u201d Mei also warned that trade disputes with the EU, Mexico and other partners might cause dips, but said buyers are holding firm. Rising Demand From Big Players Trading desks and crypto exchanges say they have seen fresh corporate orders. Some firms are buying blocks of 100 BTC or more at a time. Others are using dollar\u2011cost averaging to ease in gradually. Even smaller funds are boosting allocations, pushing aggregate demand higher. With every new all\u2011time high, more headlines appear and more investors pay attention. That creates a feedback loop: rising prices attract inflows, which lift prices further.

Parabolic moves have a habit of reversing quickly. In just seven days, Bitcoin climbed from about $108K to over $122K\u2014roughly a 14% rise.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-supply-locked-hits-new-ath-smart-money-bets-on-long-term-growth/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has broken out above the $3,000 level, reaching its highest price since late January and signaling a strong resurgence in momentum. The move comes as Bitcoin continues to set new all-time highs, injecting renewed optimism into the broader crypto market. This week could prove pivotal, with the arrival of \u201cCrypto Week\u201d in the US Congress, when lawmakers will debate and potentially vote on critical legislation shaping the future of digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm Amid this renewed bullish backdrop, on-chain fundamentals are strengthening. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared data showing that the supply of ETH staked has just reached a new all-time high. This milestone reflects growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, with more investors locking up their assets to secure the network and earn yield, rather than sell into strength. The surge in price and staking activity suggests a shift in sentiment as Ethereum regains its position as a core asset in institutional and retail portfolios. With macro and regulatory catalysts converging this week, ETH could be on the verge of a major breakout, especially if legislative clarity and Bitcoin&#8217;s momentum continue to drive capital into high-conviction assets like Ethereum. Ethereum Leads Altcoin Revival: Strong Fundamentals And Technical Momentum Ethereum is showing renewed bullish strength, acting as a key driver in the broader altcoin market recovery. After a prolonged consolidation phase that lasted several months, ETH has finally broken above the critical $3,000 mark, setting a new bullish structure and signaling the start of a potential macro uptrend. The recent price action has energized sentiment across the market, with many altcoins beginning to follow Ethereum\u2019s lead. Fundamentally, Ethereum remains one of the strongest assets in the space. According to on-chain data by Ted Pillows, the percentage of ETH supply staked has reached a new all-time high of 29.44%. This metric is critical, as it reflects growing long-term conviction from large holders and smart money. When ETH is staked, it is locked up and cannot be sold, suggesting that investors expect higher prices and are committed to holding through volatility. All eyes are now on the key resistance zone between $3,500 and $3,600. If Ethereum manages to push through this area with conviction, it could trigger a broader breakout across the altcoin market. Many traders are closely watching this level as a catalyst for an explosive altcoin rally, fueled by increased capital rotation and technical momentum. A decisive break above resistance could validate the new bullish structure and mark the beginning of the next major expansion phase for ETH and the altcoin market at large.

This breakout confirms a shift in trend structure following months of accumulation between $2,200 and $2,800. The recent surge has pushed ETH to its highest level since late January and sets the stage for a potential push toward the next major resistance at $3,500\u2013$3,600. The chart also reveals a bullish crossover as ETH trades above its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), now at $2,241, $2,658, and $2,801, respectively. This alignment indicates increasing buyer control and reinforces the strength of the uptrend. Notably, the breakout was supported by a spike in volume, adding further conviction to the move.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez says AVAX needs to stay above $20 to keep bulls alive. He argues that a sustained hold here could open the door to the next resistance zone near $26. Other analysts have a more aggressive take: reclaiming $24.27 would clear the way for a run past $54. Price Prediction Signals Mild Upside Based on current AVAX price forecast of CoinCodex, the token could rise by 6.54% to reach $23 by August 13, 2025. Technical indicators show a Neutral sentiment right now, while the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 74 (Greed).

Ethereum layer\u20112 networks and other layer\u20111 blockchains are all vying for the same users. The next few weeks should be telling. A drop below $20 could lead to more choppy trading. But a firm move above $24.20 might spark larger bets. Investors who like a bit of risk may add small positions around current prices. More cautious players may wait for a clear confirmation above the resistance band. Either way, all eyes are on Avalanche as it works through this make\u2011or\u2011break phase.
