      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/1-dogecoin-dream-chartist-parabolic-scenario/",
      "summary": "The improbable $1 price target for Dogecoin has returned to the spotlight after independent crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) shared a bold new Ichimoku-based projection on July 3. In a chart posted to X, the analyst outlined a parabolic price trajectory for DOGE using 2-week candles, suggesting that the memecoin could begin an explosive ascent in late 2025, eventually reaching the symbolic one-dollar mark. The $1 Dogecoin Dream The projection rests on DOGE\u2019s ability to maintain current bullish structure above the Ichimoku cloud, with a brief retest later this year during liftoff. \u201cDOGE 2-week candles, Ichimoku cloud shown. Why am I buying doge? Because I\u2019m delusional and this is what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d the trader wrote, pairing tongue-in-cheek self-awareness with conviction in a longer-term breakout scenario. At the time of the chart\u2019s publication, Dogecoin was trading at $0.172, up nearly 14% on the fortnight. The price action shows a clean bounce off the top of the green Ichimoku cloud, suggesting that DOGE is holding bullish structure on a high timeframe, a key technical criterion in Ichimoku trend-following theory. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst\u2014Here\u2019s The Target The Ichimoku Cloud (Kumo) on the 2-week timeframe, calculated with the traditional 9/26/52/26 settings, shows the Leading Span A (Senkou A) currently above Leading Span B (Senkou B), forming a green cloud\u2014indicative of a bullish trend outlook. DOGE\u2019s price is above the cloud, which acts as dynamic support. This is critical: Ichimoku practitioners consider price above the cloud to be in a bullish regime, especially on higher timeframes. The analyst\u2019s hand-drawn black curve on the chart begins near $0.17 and initially curves downward, touching the upper boundary of the Kumo in the near future, likely near the $0.15\u20130.16 zone. This suggests an expected retest of the cloud support, a common setup in trend continuation trades. Rather than projecting a breakdown, the curve depicts this contact as a springboard for a rapid vertical rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under $0.20 \u2018Is Free,\u2019 Says Analyst\u2014Predicts 2,000% Upside Once the price completes its cloud retest, the trajectory steepens dramatically, punching through overhead resistance near $0.29\u2014the approximate flat Kijun-sen level\u2014then continuing past prior 2024 highs. The final stretch of the curve accelerates toward the $1 level sometime in 2026, consistent with the behavior seen in prior memecoin mania phases. Interestingly, Cantonese Cat\u2019s conviction comes despite several bearish near-term signals. Just two days prior to publishing the chart, the analyst wrote: \u201cDOGE closed the month below the 20-month SMA, with a bearish engulfing candle! I would care if the volume wasn\u2019t so pathetic\u2026\u201d That statement acknowledged structural weakness but dismissed it on the basis of low participation, hinting that sellers lacked conviction. The same day, the trader disclosed renewed entries into DOGE and Avalanche, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it right, but I bought AVAX and DOGE again this morning.\u201d Broader Context DOGE\u2019s memetic status makes it particularly susceptible to sentiment shifts, and it remains uncorrelated to fundamentals in the traditional sense. Still, in the 2021 and 2024 bull markets, DOGE served as a proxy for retail risk appetite, often outperforming once attention rotated from majors like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The green cloud forecast and the rising trajectory into 2026 may reflect not just technical setups, but a broader cyclical expectation: that another wave of liquidity, speculative mania, or cultural relevance could return DOGE to the spotlight. For now, however, the price must hold the cloud before the market can validate this roadmap. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1678. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "The wait for altcoin season continues as the crypto market is still showing signs of bearish movement. Expectations are high that the altcoin market will begin to rally soon, but not everyone is optimistic that the altcoin season is coming. One of those is market analyst and expert Stockmoney Lizards, who has said that it is not happening soon. Altcoin Season Is Not Happening Soon In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Stockmoney Lizards informed their over 160,000 followers that the altcoin season could not be happening anytime soon. The analyst said that it is \u201cnot even remotely close\u201d, pointing to the rising Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin season is still far off. Related Reading: Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement Analyzing the chart, the market expert explains that despite the Bitcoin dominance having fallen by around 2%, it still doesn\u2019t mean much. This is because the dominance is still very strong and continues to trade inside the channel. This channel also charts a possible increase in the Bitcoin dominance from here, which would be detrimental for altcoins. So far, the Bitcoin dominance has also managed to hold above 65%. While this is not the highest it has ever been, it is still incredibly high, with previous altcoin seasons not happening until the dominance had fallen toward 40%. The analyst doesn\u2019t entirely rule out the possibility of an altcoin season, saying it will still come. However, for now, Bitcoin continues to dominate, as he explains that \u201cBTC is the measure of all things.\u201d Altcoin Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels As the Bitcoin dominance has risen and the altcoin dominance has fallen, they have gone toward levels not seen in years. For example, the last time the Bitcoin dominance was above 65% was back in 2021 before it crashed to usher in the altcoin season, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: AI Founder Puts XRP Price As High As $20-$30 Even worse is the Ethereum dominance, which has dropped to 5-year lows. Sitting at only 8%, it is now at levels recorded back in 2020 before the market rebounded from the COVID-19 crash. This has greatly diminished Ethereum\u2019s ability to pull the altcoin market up with it. In the same vein, the altcoin dominance, excluding Ethereum, has now dropped to 26%. The last time that the OTHERS dominance was this low was in 2021. However, this was right around when the altcoin season was starting, suggesting that the current market could be at the cusp of another altcoin run. Nevertheless, for there to be any sustainable altcoin season, the Bitcoin dominance must first crash. Going by what happened back in 2017 and 2021, at least a 40% crash in the Bitcoin dominance is required to usher in the altcoin season. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "After recovering from the recent pullbacks, SUI is attempting to reclaim a crucial resistance, which could trigger a breakout from its bullish formation. Some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency\u2019s imminent rally could target significantly higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 \u2013 Here Are The Levels To Watch SUI Eyes Key Area Reclaim On Thursday, SUI has surged more than 10% from its $2.70 support toward the crucial $3.00 barrier. The cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim this area throughout Thursday, hovering between the $2.95 and $3.08 levels. Notably, the altcoin ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March, fueling its rally toward the $4.29 high in May. Since the Q2 breakout, SUI has been trading within the $2.33-$4.10 range. Nonetheless, the June pullbacks, driven by the global geopolitical tensions, sent the token below the $3.00 mid-range support to its local low of $2.22 nearly two weeks ago, before reclaiming the $2.80-$2.90 area. Amid the start-of-month retracement, the altcoin briefly lost its local range, but the Wednesday pump reignited bullish sentiment and potentially set the stage for a rally continuation. Analyst Alex Clay noted that SUI is currently testing the confluence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) resistances alongside its bullish flag resistance. According to the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading within a bullish flag formation since May, and lost the technical indicators throughout the June pullbacks. Now, the indicators and the patterns\u2019 upper boundary sit as resistance around the $3.00-$3.10 area. If the altcoin reclaims these key levels, the analyst considers that a rally to the $5.00 resistance would be \u201can easy trade.\u201d Is A Breakout To $10 Nearby? Analyst Marcus pointed out that SUI \u201cjust snapped back from the 0.786 Fib zone sharp, clean and confident.\u201d He added that the cryptocurrency\u2019s structure held despite the correction, which confirmed a \u201chealthy pullback, not a breakdown.\u201d To the analyst, the current bounce could be the higher low that sets the stage for SUI\u2019s next major move, as \u201call signs point to a setup that\u2019s not done yet.\u201d Meanwhile, market Watcher Crypto Yhodda affirmed that SUI is \u201cin a big accumulation right now,\u201d pointing to an eight-month triangle formation. According to the analyst, a breakout from this pattern \u201ccan help it reach the dream target of $10.\u201d Similarly, Kaleo highlighted SUI\u2019s bounce on its trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and USD. He explained that there are many similarities between the base the altcoin is currently building and the base from the April lows that propelled the token to its local high. The cryptocurrency bounced off the High timeframe (HTF) ascending support line on both occasions, suggesting a massive rally could be ahead. To the analyst, the $10 target is \u201ca magnet.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter Crypto Batman also highlighted this ascending support, noting that the recent pullback marks the third time the cryptocurrency has bounced from it since August.

Additionally, he considers that SUI displays a \u201csolid-looking setup,\u201d as it is trading above the key $2.30-$2.40 area that has served as resistance and support on the weekly chart. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.09, a 15% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-sees-a-bitcoin-market-shift-heres-whats-happening/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin market now appears to be seeing a notable surge in its momentum, with the asset finally breaching the $110,000 mark to inch really close to its all-time high. The asset has so far registered a 24-hour high of $110,117, less than 3% increase away from its all-time high of $111,814 registered in May. At the time of writing, BTC trades back at $109,000 levels, marking a 1.3% increase in the past day. While the price action alone has fueled speculation of an imminent breakout, several analysts suggest that deeper structural shifts within the market are at play. On-chain data particularly reveals changes in whale activity, exchange flows, and stablecoin dynamics that could offer clues about the market\u2019s next move. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm\u2014Bitcoin Could Explode Soon Signs of Reduced Bitcoin Selling Pressure and Upward Bias CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan shared a detailed view of the current state of Bitcoin\u2019s price structure, emphasizing a broader directional change in the market that began in April. According to the analyst, Bitcoin\u2019s recent price resilience can be attributed to a noticeable decline in selling pressure from US-based institutional investors and whales. These large players, who were previously offloading significant holdings, have shifted into accumulation mode in recent months. Dan explained that Bitcoin appears to be in a transitional phase. He observed a gradual fade in sell-side activity from major US wallets since April, and that drop has been met with stable buying pressure. This suggests that institutions are no longer offloading positions but are maintaining or adding to their holdings. Dan added that the current consolidation, marked by Bitcoin&#8217;s price hovering above the $100,000 range, is allowing short-term overheated indicators to cool down. Dan noted: While the possibility of a correction remains, the broader market direction continues to be upward, so I will maintain my perspective and look forward to the second half of 2025. Overall, this could mean that the ongoing price action in the market may be the calm before a longer-term move upward, assuming macro conditions remain supportive. Exchange Outflows and Liquidity Trends Paint a Risk-On Picture Adding further context, another CryptoQuant contributor, Novaque Research, pointed to recent shifts in on-chain flows and broader liquidity conditions. According to their data, exchange outflows have picked up notably since late June, with some days seeing over 10,000 BTC withdrawn. Such behavior typically signals long-term investor confidence and a reduced likelihood of near-term sell pressure. Additionally, the report noted that miners have remained largely inactive in terms of selling despite BTC trading above $100,000. Related Reading: Whales Are Quietly Repositioning, Here\u2019s What Bitcoin\u2019s $107K Price Isn\u2019t Telling You This suggests confidence in price sustainability and possible anticipation of more favorable financial conditions. Meanwhile, stablecoin activity has also shown key changes. Both USDC and USDT supply ratios on exchanges have been trending downward since mid-June, indicating capital is sitting idle rather than flowing into spot markets. Novaque noted that investors may be on the sidelines waiting for confirmation, but the structural behavior is leaning toward accumulation. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"
