      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/will-bitcoin-move-above-110000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin&#8217;s current trading range is all part of a consolidation move before a return above $110,000. Although the leading cryptocurrency has largely held above the $105,000 support zones in recent days, its rally has taken a hit in the past two weeks. Technical analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price action, when overlapped with the Global M2 Money Supply metric, shows that it is only a matter of time before it enters into a new all-time high. Global M2 Offset Models Says Something Interesting According to a detailed post by crypto analyst Colin, also known as &#8220;The M2 Guy,&#8221; on the social media platform X, Bitcoin\u2019s price action appears to be tracking the global M2 money supply with a high degree of correlation when the data is offset by 68 to 76 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Two separate charts presented by Colin reveal this trend vividly, showing how Bitcoin price movements have followed the trajectory of the Global M2 Money Supply when adjusted for time. The short-term 68-day offset chart aligns closely with Bitcoin\u2019s behavior since April 2025, while the 76-day offset chart offers a longer-term view of the relationship. In both cases, the analyst highlighted that the M2 curve is pointing upward, where Bitcoin has yet to play out, implying a similarly bullish trajectory for its price action. Colin describes this as a form of confluence, noting that when two correlated indicators show the same directional outcome, the probability of that outcome increases. Particularly, the average correlation across both charts is around 76.6 to 76.9%, both of which are very high and lend statistical weight to the prediction. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? The 68-day offset chart shows Bitcoin trailing the M2 curve with high precision since April, with the highest 89.9% degree of accuracy on the 90-day timeframe. Similarly, the 76-day offset, while less accurate in the short term, displays a strong correlation over longer intervals of 92.2% over one and a half years and 86.2% across two years. These correlation values shows that Bitcoin is increasingly sensitive to global liquidity trends, especially now that its price movement is tied to inflows/outflows surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? This relationship becomes even more notable considering the M2 money supply itself has been climbing within a rising channel. If the alignment continues, Bitcoin may soon follow suit, lifting it back above the $110,000 level and breaking above its all-time high. Bitcoin\u2019s price action will be very interesting to follow in the next few days. In Colin\u2019s view, this next move up is not only likely but could happen within days. If Bitcoin follows this alignment, the projection shows that Bitcoin will continue to move within a channel of higher highs and higher lows before eventually crossing above $150,000 in August. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,549, up by 1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Did the next major move in blockchain technology just come from Vietnam? Developing nations are becoming key crypto drivers, with Vietnam and Pakistan emerging in recent days as potential leaders. Establishing country-level crypto standards like Vietnam has done, or developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, the way Pakistan is doing, can only boost crypto adoption at home and abroad. It also showcases how Bitcoin and broader blockchain technology can help emerging economies fuel growth and innovation. As we&#8217;ll discuss later, it could also add rocket fuel to some of the top altcoins. Vietnam, Saylor, Pakistan: 4 Takeaways What do the moves in Pakistan and Vietnam mean for the broader crypto economy? Here are four takeaways: Groundbreaking Legal Clarity in Vietnam On June 14, 2025, Vietnam passed its Law on Digital Technology Industry, effective January 1, 2026, categorizing crypto as a distinct, regulated asset class. This law affects 17M crypto holders and $105B in inflows over 2023\u201324, and provides much-needed stability, boosting investor confidence. Frameworks that Foster Innovation Vietnam\u2019s approach goes beyond crypto legalization. The law introduces incentives, such as tax breaks, R&#38;D support, and land-use benefits for sectors like AI and blockchain infrastructure, signaling a national pivot toward a tech-first economy. Pakistan\u2019s Strategic Crypto Pivot Pakistan followed Vietnam\u2019s lead a day later, on June 15, 2025, when Michael Saylor engaged with Pakistan\u2019s finance leadership to champion Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset. Pakistan launched the Pakistan Crypto Council in March 2025, developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, along with crypto mining infrastructure. Emerging Economies Leading the Way? Vietnam and Pakistan\u2019s moves reflect a global trend: emerging economies are leveraging digital assets to level up economically, rather than merely following Western nations. Demonstrating a greater appetite for crypto\u2019s revolutionary potential, Pakistan, Vietnam, and others are pushing the limits of crypto\u2019s potential in ways that could send leading altcoins soaring. Let&#8217;s investigate how top altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper, Uniswap, and Snorter Token could fare as global adoption grows. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s First-Ever Layer 2 Launches with SVM Bitcoin\u2019s great, we can all agree \u2013 230% AAR, a $2T+ market cap, etc. But could that be just the start? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unleashes Bitcoin&#8217;s full potential. While right now, $BTC is one of the world\u2019s best store-of-value assets, when it comes to crypto applications, it&#8217;s somewhat limited due to its original architecture. Bitcoin Hyper builds a Layer 2 on top of Bitcoin, leveraging the Bitcoin Relay Program on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to verify Bitcoin block headers and transaction proofs for any $BTC deposited to Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s Canonical Bridge. The result is lightning-fast transaction resolution and the ability to build out an entire DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin. There\u2019s a growing interest in Layer 2 solutions; another hot crypto presale \u2013 Solaxy ($SOLX) \u2013 just smashed through $50M raised with a Solana Layer-2. Could $HYPER surpass that with its Layer-2 solution for the world\u2019s largest crypto asset? $HYPER tokens cost $0.0119, with $1.3M raised in the presale so far. Check out the whitepaper, or learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper, and see why we think the token could go from $0.0119 to $0.02595 for 118% gains. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale page. 2. Uniswap ($UNI) \u2013 Utility Token for Leading DeFi Protocol Seeks to Regain Previous Highs It\u2019s a leading DEX, with over $1.78B traded in the past 24 hours. But Uniswap is also the 27th-largest crypto token, with a market cap of $4.91B. That\u2019s impressive enough, but could $UNI be ready to make another run? The token trades well below its all-time high of $44.97 in the heady days of the 2021 bull run. But $UNI is on the list of assets currently held by the US government \u2013 and therefore eligible for the US Digital Assets Stockpile. Uniswap officials have also been involved in talks with the US Congress over pending legislation and decentralized finance. Add in global shifts towards more formal, organized crypto frameworks, and $UNI might be ready to make big moves. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Dominate the New World of Solana Meme Coins with Snorter Bot With new meme coins launching on Solana daily, some of the best opportunities to 10x your investment live underground. Finding and trading them takes time and effort, but $SNORT and the Snorter Bot make the process easy. The Snorter Bot sniffs out the best trading opportunities. Find them, snipe them, and stay safe from rug pulls and honeypots \u2013 all with the Snorter Bot. The $SNORT token facilitates lightning-fast swapping with the lowest fees possible on Solana. As DeFi grows alongside crypto adoption, it could set the stage for tokens like $SNORT. The meme coin market is flourishing, even as traders get more and more sophisticated. Give your meme coin trading a leg up with $SNORT, currently priced at $0.0953. The presale has raised over $1M so far, showing rapid investor interest. Visit the Snorter Token ($SNORT) presale page. Vietnam, Pakistan Embrace Crypto, Set Stage for Altcoins As countries like Vietnam and Pakistan take the lead in embracing crypto, the message is clear: digital assets are no longer just speculative tools, but strategic economic levers. Vietnam\u2019s legislative clarity and Pakistan\u2019s sovereign Bitcoin ambitions show that emerging economies are helping define the future of finance. Whether it\u2019s foundational DeFi tokens like Uniswap, revolutionary Layer-2s like Bitcoin Hyper, or cutting-edge trading tools like Snorter Token, the next wave of growth could be here. Don\u2019t take our word for it \u2013 do your own research. Crypto is volatile, and this isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "summary": "In a livestream on June 15, crypto analyst Cantonese Cat delivered a firm verdict on XRP\u2019s prolonged consolidation: don\u2019t be fooled by the sideways drift. Despite trading in a tight range for over half a year, the chart veteran argued XRP is building energy for a powerful move, one that could take it as high as $6 to $8 once it breaks out of its multi-month technical cage. XRP To $8? \u201cThis thing has been going sideways for seven months,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the entire time, it\u2019s just hugging this GAN line.\u201d He referred to a long-standing monthly Gann arc structure that XRP has been grinding against since late 2024. In his interpretation, the repeated tests of that arc\u2014combined with price holding above key support zones\u2014signal strength rather than weakness. \u201cIt\u2019s just waiting for its thing,\u201d he added, implying that the eventual move could be sharp and sudden. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance Cantonese Cat highlighted that the current price action is sitting just beneath the next major Gann resistance level, which aligns closely with a Fibonacci extension target between $6 and $8. That arc, he believes, will be the trigger. \u201cI think the next level is going to end up breaking up to the GAN arc up above,\u201d he said, adding that a clean breach of this level could mark the start of XRP\u2019s long-awaited parabolic run. He also pulled up the monthly Ichimoku Cloud, pointing out that XRP had already broken above it\u2014a significant bullish milestone in Ichimoku analysis. \u201cInitially it had a rejection of the Ichimoku cloud,\u201d he explained, \u201cand now we have a true breakout.\u201d Most importantly, XRP has held the Tenkan and Kijun without falling back into the cloud. \u201cThis is basically a look of bullishness,\u201d he noted, citing the textbook structure of a confirmed trend reversal. The broader structure, according to his analysis, is a classic breakout setup: a horizontal level was cleared, back-tested, and is now serving as support. \u201cYou\u2019re basically breaking above a horizontal level here and back testing it. And so far, you\u2019re holding it pretty convincingly.\u201d To reinforce his thesis, he pointed to Fibonacci retracements\u2014specifically, XRP\u2019s behavior around the 0.86 level, which the asset has been flirting with. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to convincingly break above 0.86 here,\u201d he said, \u201cthen all-time high stuff could happen.\u201d Asked by viewers why the market isn\u2019t moving yet, he dismissed the apparent stagnation as noise. \u201cIt\u2019s just going sideways, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just waiting for its thing.\u201d In his view, the lack of momentum is not a sign of weakness, but rather a signal that XRP is compressing in a low-volatility zone\u2014a typical prelude to a high-volatility expansion. \u201cWhenever it decides to get done with this shenanigans,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s probably going to go up.\u201d Despite XRP\u2019s muted performance while other assets like Bitcoin and Solana have captured headlines, Cantonese Cat made clear that he sees no structural damage on the chart. Quite the opposite: he views the persistent adherence to long-term support levels, especially on the monthly timeframe, as an indication that XRP is simply coiling beneath resistance. Related Reading: XRP Has A 70% Shot To Beat Bitcoin, Says Analyst In a cycle increasingly defined by breakout-driven flows and rotational capital, he framed XRP\u2019s dormancy not as a failure, but as a delayed opportunity. \u201cStill holding the Tenkan and Kijun just fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what bullish looks like.\u201d The analyst didn\u2019t offer a date, but was blunt about the price levels to watch. If XRP clears the monthly Gann arc and maintains strength above the 0.86 Fibonacci zone, the $6\u2013$8 range comes into play\u2014levels that would not only exceed previous all-time highs, but also flip sentiment from apathy to euphoria in a matter of weeks. Until then, he warned, XRP\u2019s breakout might not announce itself loudly. But when it comes, few will be positioned. \u201cStill sleeping on XRP?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou might want to wake up soon.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.20 Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

The slow grind suggests neither buyers nor sellers have full conviction. Still, big holders continue to stack coins, waiting for the next catalyst. Rising Activity On Layer 2 And Services On\u2011chain data shows whales directing attention to specific services. Transaction volume in Ethereum Name Service jumped over 300% in the second week of July. Lending protocols on Ethereum saw a more than 200% rise. Meanwhile, transfers of USDC on layer 2 networks\u2014Base, Arbitrum and Optimism\u2014all posted triple\u2011digit gains. These numbers point to growing use of scaling layers and services beyond simple trading. Spot ETF Inflows Update Institutional interest has been strong too. US spot Ether products saw inflows for 19 straight days before a small pullback. That streak brought in $1.37 billion, mostly into BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust. On the day the run ended, the funds recorded just a little over $2 million in outflows. It\u2019s a minor wobble in what has so far been a solid embrace of Ether by big financial firms.

Dogecoin Price Could Hit $8 The analyst began by stripping the chart to its monthly timeframe and toggling off short-term clutter. He noted that Dogecoin has already tested the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud and, despite failing to \u201cpenetrate the monthly cloud\u201d on the first attempt, continues to coil beneath it. \u201cEven if it goes sideways for another month or two,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to enter the Ichimoku cloud one way or another\u2014you can either push up like that or you can just go sideways and you get inside the cloud.\u201d Under either scenario, the tenor remains constructive because the price is \u201cforming higher highs and higher lows.\u201d Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash \u2013 Here\u2019s The Rest Of The Forecast Central to his conviction is the 20-month simple moving average, a line he regards as the spine of every major Dogecoin bull cycle. During the manic run of early 2021, price action \u201crode the 20[-month SMA] up\u201d without once breaking it; when that moving average finally failed, the bear market ensued. Today, Dogecoin sits on top of the same level. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re able to use that as support,\u201d he argued, and that support zone\u2014currently just below the handle\u2014doubles as what he calls a \u201cbuy zone\u201d for long-horizon traders. The analyst himself \u201cwas buying more DOGE the last 4-5 days,\u201d he revealed via X. Cantonese Cat also addressed the coin\u2019s lethargy since April, insisting that the compression is constructive rather than dangerous. He pointed to the fact that Dogecoin is grinding just beneath the 0.5 log-scale retracement of the entire 2021\u20132022 decline, a behaviour he interprets as \u201cbuilding up some energy.\u201d The longer the coil, the sharper the eventual expansion, he argued, provided the higher-timeframe moving averages remain intact. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin Moon Or Crash? This Indicator Holds The Answer Pressed by viewers about timing, the analyst declined to publish a timetable and reminded his audience that the breakout will almost certainly coincide with a broader alt-season. He did, however, flag the moment price re-enters the Ichimoku cloud as the technical \u201cgreen light\u201d for acceleration. Once that happens, the measured-move objective from the cup-and-handle and the GAN arc intersection converge in the $5\u2013$8 zone\u2014levels that would represent new all-time highs and deliver returns of roughly 3,000\u20135,000 percent from current prices. \u201cAnything that\u2019s closer to the twenty-one moving average is a good area to add,\u201d he concluded, cautioning newcomers not to chase sudden green candles but to accumulate methodically while the chart remains \u201cboring.\u201d The implication is clear: Dogecoin\u2019s dormancy may be the final shakeout before the largest impulse of the cycle, and those ignoring the calm may indeed \u201cregret sleeping on this chart\u201d if\u2014and only if\u2014the structural signals Cantonese Cat tracks fall into place. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.177. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
