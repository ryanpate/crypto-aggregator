      "summary": "Despite its choppy price action in the past seven days, the mood in the XRP camp is increasingly bullish. Particularly, XRP is witnessing a wave of bold predictions from several top crypto analysts. This comes just as a major real-world asset tokenization project promises to increase demand and utility for XRP on a global scale by tokenizing $200 million worth of assets on the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s True Value Is Higher Than $110,000, Expert Warns Not Bullish Enough On XRP? Crypto analyst CrediBULL is pushing a bold message to the XRP community: the market is still underestimating the altcoin&#8217;s bullish setup. In a post on social media platform X, he noted that XRP is currently going on its eighth month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, which is a feat that few assets in the market can match. He pointed to this extended sideways movement, especially after a strong impulse off the $0.50 level in late 2024, as evidence that XRP is preparing for a continuation of the breakout. Notably, its monthly candlestick chart shows a tight cluster of monthly candles hovering above the $2.00 range. According to CrediBULL, this structure is one of the cleanest in the crypto space, second only to Bitcoin. Image From X: CrediBULL Another major contributor to the current bullish narrative is an analyst known as Ripple Pundit, who projected a 35,000% price surge for XRP the moment Ripple announces a banking license. In his post on the social media platform, he predicted that a regulatory greenlight and the final resolution of XRP&#8217;s regulatory overhang with the SEC could trigger a significant increase in price. Similarly, market commentator SMQKE drew attention to the explosive XRP price surge in late 2017 and early 2018, during which Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen briefly became one of the wealthiest individuals in the world due to XRP\u2019s quick rally from $0.00065 to $2.5. SMQKE noted that the last cycle was merely a glimpse of what\u2019s coming. The next wave of adoption will be global, fully regulated, and built for scale. In his words, \u201c2018 was just a warm-up.\u201d Technical analyst Ali Martinez added further credibility to the bullish case by pointing out the $2.38 level as the next major resistance. This is based on on-chain data from Glassnode\u2019s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which shows a significant XRP volume concentrated at this price level. If XRP manages to clear this area with strong volume, it would not only overcome heavy resistance but also trigger a cascade of buying interest and a major rally. Image From X: @ali_charts Mercado Bitcoin Tokenization Deal On XRPL XRP\u2019s underlying utility is also gaining traction beyond price charts and predictions. Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America\u2019s largest digital asset platforms, recently announced plans to tokenize over $200 million worth of real-world assets (including fixed income and equity instruments) directly on the XRP Ledger.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ethereum-ready-for-explosive-breakout-5791-the-minimum-target-analyst/",
      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s price action is gearing up for a surge of epic proportions, according to crypto technical analyst MasterAnanda on the TradingView platform. Ethereum has spent a majority of the past two months consolidating above the $2,425 support zone, in what might be an accumulation phase before a major breakout. Nonetheless, MasterAnanda&#8217;s analysis suggests that Ethereum is on the verge of entering its strongest bullish wave in years, with a breakout target that starts at $5,791. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Ethereum To Break Out To At Least $5,791 MasterAnanda\u2019s weekly candlestick chart shows a large ETH wedge pattern with consistently rising lows from June 2022 to April 2025. On the other hand, price highs have been relatively flat, specifically around the March and December 2024 peaks. Ethereum\u2019s behavior since April has been marked by low volatility and sideways movement, which often precedes large market moves. The most interesting move was when its price dropped to as low as $1,470 on April 9 before quickly rebounding and establishing a rounded bottom formation. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that Ethereum is due a major, major bullish wave. The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will. Now that the current consolidation is sitting right above trendline support, MasterAnanda argues that this formation will soon give way to a powerful bullish wave. The target is a minimum of $5,791, which is based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. Interestingly, the analyst noted that it is possible for the Ethereum price to reach $8,500 or higher in the longer term if it breaks above the resistance trendline, which is currently at $4,000. This prediction is backed by improving fundamentals and current on-chain data showing accumulation through Spot Ethereum ETFs. Wyckoff Accumulation Says It&#8217;s Ethereum\u2019s Turn Crypto analyst Ted Pillows shared a separate but related analysis on the social platform X that&#8217;s based on a Wyckoff accumulation pattern playing out on ETH\u2019s weekly chart. Pillows called the selloff to the $1,470 low in April as the \u201cSpring\u201d phase of Wyckoff accumulation, followed by a successful \u201cTest\u201d of a September 2024 support around $2,145, and the gradual move back to resistance now. According to his projection, Ethereum\u2019s breakout will unfold in stages. The first stage is a push to $3,000, then a correction, followed by a rise to $4,000 in Q3. Only after these steps will the parabolic leg truly begin. The parabolic leg, in this case, should take Ethereum above $5,700, if the price action plays out as predicted. Related Reading: XRP\u2019s Time Is Now, Says Pundit\u2014Don\u2019t Snooze On The \u2018Biggest Transfer Of Wealth\u2019 His analysis closely aligns with MasterAnanda\u2019s call for a minimum $5,791 target. Just as the Wyckoff accumulation pattern pumped Bitcoin to its most recent all-time high, Ethereum may be on the verge of its own spotlight moment in this ongoing 2025 bull cycle. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,516. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
