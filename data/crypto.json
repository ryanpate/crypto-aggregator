      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-2-billion-open-interest/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s open interest is in focus, with this crucial metric highlighting the amount of interest that the top meme coin is getting at the moment. This comes as DOGE continues to struggle below the psychological $0.2 level, providing a bearish outlook for the meme coin. Dogecoin Open Interest Averages $2 Billion In June Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin open interest (OI) has been hovering around $2 billion since the start of this month. This represents a drop from the open interest recorded in May. DOGE\u2019s OI had climbed to as high as $3.07 billion on May 11 as the meme coin\u2019s price surged to $0.25. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself This drop in Dogecoin open interest can be attributed to the drop in DOGE\u2019s price since then. The meme coin began the month below the psychological $0.2 level, which has sparked bearish sentiments. Open interest refers to the amount of interest in the derivatives market for a particular asset. As such, a drop in this metric is usually bearish. However, it is worth mentioning that the Dogecoin open interest is still above the monthly average recorded in March and April, during the period when the Trump tariffs caused crypto assets to tumble. Back then, DOGE dropped to as low as $0.14 and was at risk of losing its bull market structure. Crypto analyst BitMonty expects DOGE to bounce back amid this drop in the Dogecoin open interest. In an X post, he said the meme coin is testing the 0.618 Fib retracement and the lower boundary of a falling wedge. He added that this is a high confluence bounce zone, and reversal signs could spark a breakout move soon. BitMonty predicts that DOGE could rally to as high as $0.26420 on this bounce. DOGE Setting Up For A Bullish Reversal In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade indicated that the Dogecoin price may be setting up for a bullish reversal. He revealed that DOGE is returning to the previous swing low, while the RSI shows a higher low. The analyst noted that this could lead to a bullish divergence, indicating weakened selling momentum and early signs of a potential reversal to the upside. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Expected To Reach $3 By EOY As 2021 Cycle Trend Returns In another X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin is expected to experience a significant surge before entering a prolonged falling wedge pullback. Interestingly, his accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could rally to as high as $30. However, this price surge isn\u2019t expected to happen in just this market cycle alone, with the chart highlighting 2029 as the target year to reach this price level. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.18, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "summary": "&#8220;PEPE is showing strength after a clean breakout above the key resistance zone,\u201d UniChartz shared in a recent post on X, highlighting a decisive shift in the meme coin\u2019s short-term momentum. The breakout reflects renewed buying pressure as the price pushed beyond a major barrier that had previously capped upside moves. PEPE Finds Its Footing at Strong Confluence Zone The analyst further noted that PEPE is now &#8220;in the process of retesting that breakout level,&#8221; calling it &#8220;a classic bullish confirmation if the zone holds.&#8221; This retest phase is a critical moment; if bulls successfully defend the newly formed support zone, it could open the door for another leg higher. Overall, the price action suggests that bullish momentum is building, with the current consolidation acting as a potential launchpad for the next move upward. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump\u2019s Feed\u2014Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? According to UniChartz, PEPE\u2019s price action continues to respect a well-established rising trendline, which has acted as reliable dynamic support over the past few months. This trendline has been tested on multiple occasions, each time resulting in a bullish reaction, a strong indication that buyers are stepping in during these retests. Furthermore, this diagonal support aligns closely with a key horizontal demand zone, forming a critical confluence that strengthens the overall bullish structure. As long as PEPE stays above these intersecting support levels, the market structure remains tilted in favor of the bulls. The price consolidating in this region suggests a potential accumulation phase, where market participants are preparing for the next move. Should PEPE bounce strongly from this confluence area, it could mark the beginning of a renewed upward leg, potentially attracting fresh buying interest and reinforcing positive sentiment. Such a move would confirm the trendline\u2019s significance and validate PEPE\u2019s ability to maintain its medium-term uptrend amid broader market uncertainty. Volume Supporting The Bullish Shift According to Whales_Crypto_Trading, PEPE has broken out of its descending channel with impressive volume, signaling a potential shift in momentum for the meme coin. PEPE\u2019s breakout was backed by a notable surge in trading activity, indicating strong interest from market participants and potentially the involvement of larger players. Related Reading: PEPE Rising Trendline Holds Firm: A Reliable Launchpad For Price Rally The analyst emphasized that if the current retest of the breakout zone holds, it may act as a launchpad for further upside in the upcoming weeks. This kind of technical retest, when supported by volume, often serves as a validation of trend reversal and reinforces bullish sentiment. Featured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-horizontal-support-under-pressure-bearish-target-at-142/",
      "summary": "Solana (SOL) is currently navigating a challenging environment as the broader crypto market experiences a cooldown. After an impressive run earlier this year, momentum has slowed significantly, and SOL is struggling to reclaim the $160 level with conviction. The lack of strong demand has been evident in recent sessions, as buying pressure fades and volume remains low across major altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC \u2013 Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout Despite this cooling phase, many investors remain optimistic. A growing number of market participants believe Solana could lead the next altseason once conditions stabilize and liquidity returns to the market. Historically, SOL has shown the ability to recover rapidly and outperform in bullish phases, making it one of the top contenders for explosive upside when sentiment shifts. However, in the short term, caution prevails. Top analyst Carl Runefelt has highlighted a key technical development, noting that Solana might be on the verge of breaking a horizontal support zone. This event could trigger further downside in the near term. If this support fails, traders should prepare for increased volatility. Still, the broader consensus remains that SOL\u2019s structural strength and ecosystem development position it well for long-term upside once macro conditions align. Solana Faces Bear Flag Breakdown Risk As Uncertainty Grows Solana has been locked in a tight range just below the $160 mark, struggling to reclaim key levels despite multiple attempts. For several days, momentum has faded, and with global markets under pressure, traders are bracing for increased volatility. The broader crypto market is losing steam as Bitcoin and Ethereum fail to sustain upward moves, which puts added pressure on altcoins like Solana. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, with ongoing tariff disputes and rising bond yields fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. The US bond market, in particular, is flashing signs of stress, adding to the caution in risk-on assets. If these conditions persist, altcoins may face a challenging period as capital retreats to more stable assets like Bitcoin or exits the market altogether. Runefelt recently highlighted a key technical pattern on Solana\u2019s chart\u2014a bear flag forming around horizontal support. According to his analysis, this structure could break down any hour now, which would confirm the bearish setup and potentially send SOL down toward the $142 level. This target aligns with previous support zones and could act as a temporary bottom if the broader market stabilizes. Despite the short-term risks, long-term sentiment around Solana remains cautiously optimistic. The network\u2019s continued development and strong DeFi presence could fuel a recovery once market conditions improve. For now, however, traders are closely watching the $160 resistance and the $150\u2013$152 support area, which could determine the next directional move. A clean break below support would likely trigger a wave of selling, while a reclaim of the $160 level could invalidate the bearish setup and open the door for a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target \u2013 Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? SOL Tests Key Support As Bearish Momentum Builds Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $152.62 on the 4-hour chart, testing a critical horizontal support zone as bearish momentum continues. The recent price action shows a clear downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows forming since the rejection from the $176\u2013$180 area in late May. All key moving averages\u201434 EMA, 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA\u2014are positioned above the current price, signaling short-term weakness and a lack of bullish momentum. Volume has picked up slightly as price nears support, suggesting increasing market interest at this level. However, the failure to break above the 34 EMA (currently at $157.70) reinforces the view that sellers are still in control. The flattening 200 SMA at $165.31 and declining 50 SMA around $159.82 indicate that SOL must reclaim the $160\u2013$165 zone to regain strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty \u2013 Analyst If the $150\u2013$152 support range fails to hold, Solana could break down and target the next key support area around $142, in line with the projected move of the bear flag pattern identified by analysts. For now, bulls must defend this level to prevent deeper losses and keep hopes of a recovery alive in the near term. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-self-custody-is-the-future-best-wallet-leads-the-way/",
      "summary": "What does crypto want to be when it grows up? Centralized exchanges like Coinbase have long marketed themselves as crypto&#8217;s answer to convenience. User-friendly, regulated, and custodial. Just give them the keys and let them drive. They&#8217;ll handle all the boring details \u2013 like on/off ramps, UI, integrated swapping, and little things like taking control of your crypto. And in return, all you need to do is trust. But increasingly, that deal sounds like a bad one. The trade-off between trust and control is no longer worth it. Trust Coinbase and other custodial platforms too much, and what do you get? Hacks and data breaches, among other things. There\u2019s a better path forward \u2013 and more and more crypto users are looking for it. A Better Custody Deal So, what should the future of crypto be? Crypto should still be easy. It should still be intuitive. But it should also be private, safe, secure, and truly self-custodial. After all, the old adage of \u2018not your keys, not your crypto\u2019 shouldn&#8217;t just be a slogan \u2013 it is, and should be, the foundation of decentralized finance. That&#8217;s where wallets like Best Wallet come in. Unlike centralized platforms, self-custody crypto wallets like Best Wallet don&#8217;t hold your private keys. You have complete control of your assets at all times. There are no middlemen, no single points of failure, and no need to put your trust in third parties. But what about the convenience of swapping crypto, sending crypto, and exploring new crypto opportunities all from one app? Bridging the Gap: Self-Custody Meets Convenience The future of crypto points to tools that combine the convenience of centralized exchanges like Coinbase, including KYC and AML requirements, with the security of self-custody, without sacrificing usability. We&#8217;ve already seen this with tools like Railgun, which complies with KYC while enabling private transactions on DeFi platforms, and which Vitalik Buterin just used to transfer $2.6M in crypto. While transactions of that size may well be just another day in the office for the Ethereum founder, it demonstrates how increasingly important privacy, control, and functionality are in the developing crypto economy. This is nothing new; it&#8217;s often the people most deeply involved in tech who understand just how important it is to control your own data (and your own crypto). Remember Zuckerberg\u2019s camera? That was the time he was promoting Meta, and everyone realized he&#8217;d taped across his laptop&#8217;s microphone and camera. Was that paranoia or an understanding of just how vulnerable our data is? That&#8217;s the balance that Best Wallet wants to deliver, beating MetaMask at its own game and dominating the Web3 self-custody wallet market. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 The Self-Custody Crypto Wallet Presale Token Crypto wallets aren\u2019t just handy places to stash some spare Bitcoin, at least not anymore. The best crypto wallets \u2013 like Best Wallet \u2013 serve as all-in-one control hubs for crypto investors, whether you&#8217;re operating multiple wallets, swapping tokens, ot investing in crypto presales. And that&#8217;s not all. The Best Wallet ecosystem is supercharged by its own token, $BEST. Best Wallet Token holders get: Lower transaction fees Higher staking rewards Earlier presale access Eligibility for bonus crypto airdrops (such as BTC Bull Token\u2019s Bitcoin airdrop) Best Wallet and the $BEST token are building the crypto future that Buterin and others are looking for: interconnected, seamless, and self-custodial. It&#8217;s everything you could want or ever need from a crypto wallet. You can manage your portfolio, browse upcoming token launches (including the best new meme coins), and spend your crypto in real life with the upcoming Best Card. Buying, selling, and swapping are as easy as tapping a few buttons. And all this is secured with multi-party computation (MPC) and biometric authentication to keep your crypto safe without sacrificing ease of use. The Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $13.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.025135. That could rise to $0.035215 by the end of the year, according to our $BEST price prediction, delivering gains of 40% to current presale investors. Learn more about how to buy Best Wallet Token with our guide. Best Wallet: Building the Self-Custodial Future of Crypto No longer does crypto have to choose between usability and control. Tools like Best Wallet are showing that self-custody platforms can match \u2013 or even beat \u2013 the convenience that centralized exchanges offer while staying true to the core values of crypto. As more self-custodial models appear in a post-Coinbase world, Best Wallet wants to lead the charge and dominate this $11B sector. If it succeeds, it will be by delivering a product that is convenient and completely crypto-native. Always do your own research before investing in crypto; this isn\u2019t financial advice. Crypto self-custody is the future. Best Wallet is helping to build that future."

      "title": "Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-to-10000-2/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price is falling fast, and with bears currently taking control, a crypto analyst has forecasted an impending crash below $100,000. While this potential downturn may sound alarming, the analyst has also revealed that after the pullback, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to undergo a significant price rally to new all-time highs. Bitcoin Price Faces Immediate Crash Risk Bitcoin appears to be entering a cooling phase after experiencing a significant bullish run that spanned several weeks and led to its current all-time high of almost $112,000. \u2018MelikaTrader94\u2019, the TradingView crypto analyst responsible for this new technical analysis, predicts that during this cooling period, bears could take over and send the Bitcoin price crashing down to former lows under $100,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings On a 4-hour chart presented by the analyst, Bitcoin has consistently respected a descending trendline acting as a strong resistance threshold. This line, which formed after the recent peak, has now rejected price action multiple times, preventing further upward movement and hinting at growing bearish pressure in the short term. At the time of the analysis, Bitcoin was trading at $106,432, attempting to test the descending trendline once again. However, the chart shows that BTC lacks strong momentum, suggesting that another rejection is likely. If this rejection occurs, BTC\u2019s price action is expected to correct downward toward the $99,000 region, marked on the chart as a key horizontal support zone. Bitcoin\u2019s projected pullback is consistent with typical market behavior, especially after an extended bullish phase. Based on the TradingView expert\u2019s analysis, a drop to the $99,000 support level could shake out weak hands and provide fresh buy-dip opportunities for traders. While the structure of the projected downward move is not entirely bearish, it suggests a necessary retest of lower support areas before any sustainable rally can resume. Bullish Continuation Expected After Pullback MelikaTrader94 has suggested that correcting down to the $99,000 support zone is critical for determining Bitcoin\u2019s next rally. If this crash successfully occurs and buyers step in to defend the support, BTC could begin forming a strong bullish continuation structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch The TradingView analyst\u2019s chart outlines a possible rebound from the support area, which could trigger a breakout above the descending trendline. A sustained move above this trendline would potentially invalidate the short-term bearish structure and set the stage for a new all-time high, with price targets extending beyond $114,000. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s consolidation around its current price of $104,500, followed by a possible dip to the well-established support zone, fits the analyst\u2019s narrative that the market is preparing for a big move. The TradingView expert has urged investors and traders to keep an eye out for a strong bounce, as this projected pullback could be a healthy one that comes just before a bullish leg up.
