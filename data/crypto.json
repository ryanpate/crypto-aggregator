Bitcoin sank 5%, slipping under the $104,000 mark. Altcoins fared worse, with losses ranging from 6% to 9%. Based on reports from Coinglass, more than $1 billion was wiped out in liquidations, over $1 billion of which were long positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million?

Oil prices have climbed about 30% since May lows, analysts say. Anyone betting on lower inflation or early rate cuts may have to rethink things. Gold\u2019s climb suggests that many feel uneasy about what comes next. Even so, some expect this spike to calm once tensions ease. What Comes Next For Crypto Short-term views remain mixed. Some traders see this as a knee-jerk reaction and expect a rebound once headlines fade. Others warn that the US CPI release later this week could add another twist. Inflation data could either fuel more selling or pave the way for relief if numbers come in cooler than expected.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-crash-to-94000-imminent/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price action has shown signs of fading momentum three weeks after reaching a new all-time high of $111,814. The leading cryptocurrency climbed back above $110,000 on Monday off the back of cooling U.S. inflation data and a temporarily weaker dollar. However, the rally was short-lived. Profit-taking, compounded by geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, has contributed to a risk-off environment that pushed Bitcoin down below $105,000 in the past 24 hours. This sharp reversal highlights a significant technical level that could decide whether Bitcoin sustains its uptrend or enters a crash towards $94,000. Final Fibonacci Resistance Holding The Line According to a new analysis shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst XForceGlobal on the social media platform X, Bitcoin\u2019s current corrective structure could deepen if it fails to overcome the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance level. The analyst highlighted that the bullish impulse that carried Bitcoin now appears to be losing steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 The price zone around $110,500, which is marked by the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance, has not been convincingly breached, casting doubt on the strength of the current wave structure. Bitcoin tested this level twice earlier this week, and, as noted by the analyst, if this resistance level fails to break soon, there is a slight possibility of a deeper pullback. If this pullback does occur, this would lead to the formation of a corrective wave C, and with distinct symmetry in an ABC corrective pattern. In this case of the corrective Wave C playing out, the next central area of interest lies around the $94,000 level, an area that aligns with the completion of a larger impulse Wave 2. Wave 2 Dip To $96,000 Before Bullish Wave 3 Begins The rundown of a corrective Wave 2 and a bearish impulse Wave 2 is based on the outlook of Bitcoin failing to clear the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance at $110,000. Applying the Elliott wave count on the current price action shows that the recent push to $111,814 all-time high was a larger bullish impulse Wave 1. However, the ensuing correction since then has also played out in the form of a sub-wave 123 structure, and an ABC corrective pattern. Altogether, these are expected to make up a larger corrective impulse Wave 2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Crash To $31,000 Amid 5-Wave Impulse Completion Nevertheless, XForceGlobal noted that Bitcoin is still in a highly bullish structure on the macro level. If the price action plays out this way, the next move after the impulse Wave 2 to $94,000 would be a reversal upwards with bullish impulse Wave 3. In this case, the analyst projected an expansion move that would send Bitcoin to another all-time high. Notably, the price target in this case would be a surge above $118,500. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000, down by 2.5% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Ethereum faced intense selling pressure earlier today as geopolitical tensions flared following Israel\u2019s attack on Iran, shaking global markets and triggering risk-off behavior across crypto. The sudden spike in volatility pushed Ethereum away from its recent highs, as it retraced after failing to break above the critical $3,000 resistance level. This marks a pivotal moment for ETH, which had shown strong momentum in recent sessions before being hit by the broader market downturn. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History \u2013 Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally Despite the sharp correction, top analyst Quinten Francois remains optimistic. He pointed to the ETH/BTC pair, which continues to look strong relative to other assets. According to Francois, this pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle\u2014a pattern that often precedes a breakout to the upside if support holds. With Bitcoin holding near its range highs, Ethereum\u2019s performance against BTC could serve as a leading indicator for the broader altcoin market. Now, Ethereum stands at a crossroads. A bounce from current levels could renew bullish momentum and re-establish the $2,800\u2013$3,000 range as the launchpad for higher prices. But failure to hold support may trigger another wave of downside pressure. All eyes are on ETH/BTC as markets brace for what comes next. Ethereum Holds Key Level Against BTC Ethereum has been leading the crypto market with impressive strength since April, posting a remarkable surge of over 100% from its lows near $1,400. This steep recovery highlights Ethereum\u2019s growing momentum, positioning it as a potential frontrunner in triggering the next altseason. The asset\u2019s consistent performance above key support levels and its resilience during market dips have renewed bullish sentiment, with traders increasingly focusing on ETH as the key asset to watch. Many analysts believe Ethereum could be the spark that reignites capital rotation into altcoins. Its breakout from a month-long range, combined with increasing DeFi activity and improving on-chain metrics, has added to the bullish case. However, caution remains. Ongoing geopolitical tensions\u2014particularly the recent escalation between Israel and Iran\u2014are injecting volatility into global markets, including crypto. These developments have disrupted otherwise promising technical setups across the board, leading to uncertainty and risk-off sentiment. Quinten Francois commented on the current climate, noting that \u201csome charts don\u2019t look good, others are holding on by a thread.\u201d However, he singled out the ETH/BTC pair as a relative strength signal, stating that it \u201cstill looks good.\u201d This pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle\u2014a structure that, if defended, could pave the way for a continuation of ETH\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin. In this environment, Ethereum\u2019s performance\u2014especially relative to BTC\u2014could determine the broader market\u2019s next phase. If ETH/BTC holds and breaks higher, the door opens for a full altseason run. But a failure to hold could reinforce caution and signal a pause across the crypto market. For now, Ethereum remains the most important chart to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support \u2013 Can Bulls Defend This Level? ETH Faces Sharp Rejection After Tagging Range Highs Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test after a strong rejection near the $2,830 resistance level. The chart shows ETH failing to hold above the highlighted supply zone between $2,700 and $2,830, where sellers stepped in aggressively. This resulted in a sharp breakdown that sliced through the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) on the 4-hour timeframe, now positioning ETH around $2,512. What\u2019s more concerning is the spike in volume during the breakdown. This confirms the strength behind the move, signaling panic among bulls and potential distribution by short-term holders. ETH is now holding just above a previous support zone from early June, but the current setup suggests uncertainty and risk of further downside. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance \u2013 Breakout Or Breakdown? Unless Ethereum can reclaim the $2,600\u2013$2,620 area soon, the next likely target could be the $2,400 level, where the next strong demand cluster sits. However, if bulls defend current prices and manage a quick recovery back above the SMAs, this recent move could be interpreted as a liquidity sweep before continuation.

      "summary": "According to CNBC\u2019s Power Lunch, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin could climb all the way to $1 million per coin if big institutions keep piling in. The cryptocurrency hit a weekly peak of $110,290 on Tuesday. It slipped 4.5% to $104,300 by Thursday, but it\u2019s still climbed 1.75% over the past seven days. Novogratz says this isn\u2019t just hype. He points to firms moving cash from dollars and gold into crypto. Related Reading: BTC Is Just 0.2% Of Global Wealth \u2014 And That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Not Too Late: Analyst Institutional Moves Up Demand BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went live in January 2024 after SEC approval. Based on reports, that fund now gives big investors a straightforward path to own Bitcoin without buying coins directly. BlackRock manages about $11.6 trillion in assets. When a player that size steps in, others notice. Novogratz says wealth managers and pension funds have started treating Bitcoin like a macro asset, on par with gold and the S&#38;P 500. Growing Corporate Interest Treasury companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to follow suit. Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright. Related Reading: TRX Price Up As Tron Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Trump-Backed Stablecoin According to filings, Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop, and US President Donald Trump\u2019s Media arm all announced major purchases this year. Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin Versus Gold Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1\u20132% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn\u2019t guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today\u2019s $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Challenges Ahead Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin\u2019s price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn\u2019t impossible, but it won\u2019t happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin\u2019s march toward gold\u2019s market cap as a \u201cball rolling down a hill.\u201d He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it.

      "summary": "The XRP price could be preparing for its biggest rally yet, as a crypto analyst now points to a potential breakout that could send this altcoin soaring. After weeks of stabilization and momentum building, XRP is now testing key resistance levels, with the daily timeframe hinting at a possible surge above $2.33. XRP Price Gears Up For Major Breakout Dark Defender, an X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst, has revealed in a recent analysis that XRP appears to be setting the stage for a significant price shift, with its daily chart signaling a possible upward breakout. After weeks of consolidation below a descending trendline, the altcoin is now approaching a critical level that could become the trigger point for rapid momentum growth, if confirmed. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target Currently, the daily timeframe shows XRP testing a long-term downtrend line that has consistently rejected upward movements since early 2025. This resistance level, marked clearly on the analyst\u2019s chart, hovers just above $2.3. Dark Defender has indicated that a daily candle close above $2.33 could effectively invalidate the downtrend and signal a breakout that may lead to further upside. Notably, the analyst\u2019s 1-day XRP price chart shows an explosive move toward a new high of $3.39\u2014a level not seen since the 2018 bull cycle. With XRP currently trading at $2.1, a successful rally to this bullish target would represent an impressive 61.43% surge in value. Such a move would not only break XRP out of its current consolidation phase but also confirm the emergence of a sustained uptrend. Moreover, if momentum persists, it could set the stage for even higher price levels. RSI And EMA Signals Defend XRP\u2019s Bullish Thesis Supporting Dark Defender\u2019s technical analysis and bullish scenario for the XRP price is a rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has broken above a descending trendline and continues to trend upward. This shift suggests that XRP is building momentum as buyers finally regain control. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says XRP Is No Longer A Speculative Asset \u2013 Here\u2019s What It Is Additionally, the analysis shows that price action remains above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), which are beginning to curl upward, signaling that the market trends could be turning in favor of the bulls. Although the Ichimoku Cloud technical indicator is not visible on the chart, Dark Defender notes that it is expected to flip bullish soon, further reinforcing XRP\u2019s bullish thesis. Combined with the support held above the 200-day EMA, highlighted by the blue line on the chart, XRP appears to be entering a favorable technical zone. If price action aligns with the analyst\u2019s projected setup and manages to hold candle closes above $2.33, it could mark the beginning of a stronger uptrend. Dark Defender also notes that \u201cXRP\u2019s slingshot pressure\u201d is intensifying rapidly, further boosting the potential strength of the upcoming bullish wave.
