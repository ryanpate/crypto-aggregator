Even Coinbase Prime, one of the main outlets for big players, shows only 63,535 BTC available. Corporate Trends And Outlook Strategy\u2019s moves still cast a long shadow. Only 26 other public companies have more than 1,000 BTC, and just seven hold over 10,000 BTC. On-chain data points to nearly 2,000 whale wallets that top those numbers. In the past week alone, five additional firms bought BTC, using their purchases to grab attention on social media.

      "summary": "Data shows the demand for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has cooled off for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has continued to attract inflows. Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency&#8217;s price movements in a manner that&#8217;s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. &#8220;Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,&#8221; notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. &#8220;Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. &#8220;A pause in demand after a strong run-up &#8211; watch for signs of re-acceleration.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30\u2014Is A New All-Time High Next?

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-weekly-structure-tightens-tower-top-pattern-in-play/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has pulled back roughly 14% since the last week of May, but it\u2019s holding firm above the critical $2,400 support zone. Despite recent volatility across the crypto market, ETH\u2019s ability to defend this level has kept hopes alive for a potential recovery. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum\u2019s next move, as the asset still trades well below its yearly highs, offering room for upside if momentum returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 \u2013 Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups. However, many believe ETH is now positioned to recover lost ground \u2014 if bulls can reclaim the $2,800 resistance and flip it into support. A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row \u2014 a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH \u201cstill looks pre-tower top,\u201d suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400\u2013$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum\u2019s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle \u2014 a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000\u2013$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages \u2013 Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages \u2014 including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart \u2013 Rally Ahead? For bulls, reclaiming and holding above the 100 SMA is crucial for breaking out of the current range and targeting the $2,700\u2013$2,800 region. On the downside, a loss of the 200 SMA could lead to a swift retest of $2,430 and potentially deeper downside. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
