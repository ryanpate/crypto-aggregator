      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s blistering second-quarter advance is tracking the strongest expansion in global liquidity on record, according to Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts, who argues that every additional percentage point of liquidity injected into the financial system \u201cshould\u201d translate into a 20% gain for the cryptocurrency. 1% Liquidity = 20% Bitcoin? Writing on X, Coutts observed that his proprietary Global Liquidity Index broke to a fresh all-time high on 10 April after three years of drift and that, in the nine weeks since, Bitcoin has rallied about 40 percent. &#8220;Bitcoin has rallied 40% since April 10 which was when my global liquidity aggregate (GLI) after 3 years broke out to new all time highs on the back of a plummeting US dollar. Since then the aggregate is up 2%. Bitcoin&#8217;s Q2 rally is entirely consistent with liquidity regimes of this nature.&#8221; He added that &#8220;while Bitcoin\u2019s sensitivity to GLI moderates over time, for every extra 1 percent of liquidity added to the system we should expect to see a &#62; 20 percent move in the price of Bitcoin,\u201d he said, further claiming that the steady inflow of capital \u201cdoesn\u2019t account for the inevitable \u2018oh shit\u2019 moment of panic buying that is going to happen\u2026 eventually. It will be best of times, it will be the worst of times.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet\u2014But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos The chart he shared, reproduced above, overlays his GLI (white) with daily Bitcoin prices (orange) from 2018 through June 2025. It shows the index pressing to roughly $138 trillion while Bitcoin changes hands near $108,000, underscoring the tight directional relationship between the two series across several liquidity cycles. Coutts builds the indicator by combining G4 central-bank balance sheets, broad money aggregates such as M2, and key US liquidity accounts including the Treasury General Account and the Federal Reserve\u2019s reverse-repo facility. Since the April breakout the GLI has added only about two percentage points, yet Bitcoin\u2019s market value has already risen by twice the elasticity implied by his model\u2014an outcome he considers \u201centirely consistent\u201d with prior liquidity regimes, which tend to produce the sharpest price response early in the cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: \u2018Fair Price\u2019 Today Is $230,000 For now, he sees little evidence that the GLI\u2019s momentum is cresting; with the Federal Reserve still draining its reverse-repo facility, the People\u2019s Bank of China quietly expanding its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank hinting at renewed long-term refinancing operations, the backdrop remains structurally bullish even if it won\u2019t be a straight line. Looking further out, mainstream liquidity research suggests modest but persistent growth: most macro desks expect the global aggregate to rise roughly one to six percent over the next twelve months, three to eight percent cumulatively by mid-2027, and on the order of ten to fifteen percent by the turn of the decade as governments roll over record debt loads and central banks normalise balance-sheet policies. If Coutts\u2019 rule of thumb holds, even the low end of those projections would leave ample headroom for triple-digit percentage gains in Bitcoin before 2030. At press time, BTC traded at $107,676.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-breakout-imminent-broadening-wedge-hints-at-4200-surge/",
      "summary": "According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum (ETH) may be gearing up for a major breakout that could propel the cryptocurrency close to the $4,200 mark. Meanwhile, ETH continues to attract growing institutional interest, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) outperforming their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts. Ethereum Headed For A Breakout? In a recent X post, noted crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH is climbing within a massive weekly broadening wedge structure. The analyst shared the following chart and suggested that ETH could be targeting the $4,200 level &#8211; marking the top of the wedge. For the uninitiated, a broadening wedge is a chart pattern characterized by diverging trendlines, where price makes higher highs and lower lows, forming a megaphone-like shape. It typically indicates increasing market volatility and can signal a potential breakout, with the direction depending on the prevailing trend and breakout confirmation. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates \u2013 Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto echoed a similar outlook, stating that ETH is \u201csetting up for a big move,\u201d especially with over $2.2 billion in short positions clustered near the $3,000 level. If Ethereum breaks above $3,000, it could trigger a short squeeze, potentially accelerating ETH\u2019s rally. At the time of writing, ETH is trading 43.7% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Capital flows also indicate rising institutional interest in Ethereum. Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows recently pointed out that spot ETH ETFs attracted $240.3 million in inflows yesterday, compared to $164.6 million for spot BTC ETFs. The stronger performance of ETH ETFs suggests that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. It\u2019s worth noting that while BTC is up 54% since June 2024, ETH is still down 24.6% during the same period. Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader shared the following monthly BTC/ETH chart showing two consecutive red candles, signaling a potential shift in momentum as BTC weakens relative to ETH. The trader noted that a similar capital rotation in 2020 preceded a \u201cmonster altseason.\u201d Things Look Positive For ETH While altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and SUI created fresh ATHs in 2024, ETH\u2019s performance did not live up to expectations. As a result, the broader sentiment in the Etheruem ecosystem took a hit. Related Reading: Ethereum \u2018Insanely Undervalued\u2019 As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking \u2013 Is A Rally Imminent? However, 2025 appears to be ushering in a more favorable outlook. On-chain data reveals that ETH faces no major resistance until the $3,417 level. Additionally, ETH recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart &#8211; a bullish technical signal that could indicate an impending rally. At press time, ETH trades at $2,756, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from with Unsplash, charts from X and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-funding-rate-flips-again-and-history-says-a-rally-is-around-the-corner/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has declined slightly following recent gains, falling 2.3% over the past 24 hours to trade at approximately $107,205. This latest movement places the asset 4.1% below its all-time high of over $111,000 recorded last month. Despite the short-term dip, some analysts see familiar signs in derivatives data that could point to the next phase of market movement. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin\u2019s Calm Rally Could Be a Setup for a Massive Breakout, Analyst Reveals Funding Rate Rebounds Signal Potential Upside for Bitcoin According to recent insights shared by on-chain analyst &#8220;nino&#8221; on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin may be repeating a funding rate pattern that has historically led to price rebounds. The data shows the asset\u2019s funding rate briefly dipping into negative territory before beginning to reverse, a pattern that has aligned with price recoveries earlier in the year. Nino\u2019s analysis suggests this reversal, particularly the 72-hour moving averages exiting the oversold zone and producing a yellow-blue-black signal formation, could indicate a potential round of short position liquidations. The funding rate, still below levels typically associated with excessive bullish sentiment, may also imply that traders have yet to become overconfident, leaving room for additional upside without immediate overheating in derivatives markets. Nino\u2019s observation focuses on market structure and derivative sentiment, highlighting how positioning in perpetual futures markets could precede notable spot price moves. In particular, when funding rates turn negative and then begin to climb, they often reflect the unwinding of overly bearish bets by traders who shorted BTC at high leverage. As these traders are forced to close positions, the resulting buy pressure can act as a short-term catalyst. This setup has played out multiple times earlier in 2025, and the current conditions suggest it may be occurring again. By keeping track of moving averages and sentiment zones, traders may interpret these signals as part of a broader cyclical trend. Binance Volume Share Signals Key Trends in Market Liquidity Separately, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Burak Kesmeci, addressed structural shifts in spot trading liquidity, particularly Binance\u2019s share of global trading volume. Kesmeci emphasized that Binance\u2019s dominance remains an important barometer of institutional participation and overall market health. He explained that an increase in Binance\u2019s spot volume share is often associated with higher liquidity and smoother price discovery. Conversely, if Binance were to fall below a 30% volume threshold, it could signal a move toward more &#8220;fragmented liquidity&#8221; across exchanges such as Coinbase or Upbit. Such shifts could lead to more volatility and less predictable trading behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet\u2014But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos At present, Binance\u2019s volume share is showing signs of recovery, suggesting that capital is still flowing through the exchange and supporting a relatively stable trading environment.

      "summary": "The Tron (TRX) Sharpe Ratio suggests the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price may be far from overheating, a sign that the coin could have more upside potential. Tron Sharpe Ratio Is Still Significantly Below Overheating Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Sharpe Ratio of Tron. The &#8220;Sharpe Ratio&#8221; refers to an indicator that compares the returns of an asset against the risk associated with it. The numerator in the ratio, the &#8216;returns&#8217; portion, is defined as the difference between the average return of the coin and the risk-free return (that is, the theoretical return involved with an asset carrying zero risk) over a given period. The denominator, the &#8216;risk&#8217; part, is the asset&#8217;s standard deviation of returns over the same window (in other words, its volatility). Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet\u2014But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the cryptocurrency is printing returns that outweigh its risk. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the asset&#8217;s performance has been lackluster compared to its volatility. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Tron Sharpe Ratio over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron Sharpe Ratio fell below the 1 level earlier, but its value has since returned above the mark. According to the quant, the metric being above the level has historically accompanied bullish price action. An extremely high value, however, has proven to be an overheating signal, with the asset tending to arrive at a top. &#8220;Whenever the Adjusted Sharpe Ratio climbs above 40, it often signals a market that&#8217;s overheating,&#8221; explains the analyst. &#8220;In the past, readings over 40 have lined up well with local tops.&#8221; So far since its return above 1, the Tron Sharpe Ratio has only managed to reach a high of 8.3, which is clearly significantly below this cutoff. This trend could mean that TRX hasn&#8217;t been too overheated. &#8220;With TRX\u2019s Sharpe Ratio still far from historical peaks, the data suggests there&#8217;s plenty of upside room for a potential bull run in 2025,&#8221; says the quant. It now remains to be seen how the coin will develop in the near future, given this pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400?
