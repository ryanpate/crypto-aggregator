      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/two-things-to-drive-xrp-price/",
      "summary": "The XRP price could be preparing for a historic breakout, as a prominent crypto pundit has pinpointed two key catalysts that could send the altcoin soaring to new all-time highs. As analyst sentiment flips bullish, and XRP attempts to move out from its prolonged consolidation phase, the stage may be set for the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-awaited price explosion. Factors Set To Send XRP Price To A New ATH JD, a well-known crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has identified two critical technical conditions that could propel the XRP price to a fresh ATH target. According to the expert, XRP\u2019s path to a historic price surge depends on breaking out of a long-standing Falling Wedge pattern and invalidating the EDO Farina indicator. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% \u201cMoonshot\u201d For XRP Price If This Line Breaks The Falling Wedge pattern has held XRP in a tight consolidation phase for an extended period, particularly evident on the weekly chart. JD considers this formation historically bullish when broken to the upside, and XRP is apparently nearing a pivotal point where a breakout could be imminent. Notably, a successful breach of this Falling Wedge pattern would signal renewed bullish momentum and potentially spark a rally toward uncharted price territory. The second factor emphasized by the crypto analyst is the need to render the EDO Farina bearish indicator null and void. JD views this technical signal as a false indicator of sustained downward movement. The market expert maintains a strong and long-standing bullish position on XRP, predicting on multiple occasions that the cryptocurrency could soon skyrocket. In one of his latest price analyses, JD outlined his bullish forecast for XRP, citing his previously accurate call of a 12x rally to $3.37. Confident in his method, the analyst now aims to apply the same strategy to pinpoint the altcoin\u2019s next market top. JD also noted that no major news, hype, or sudden excitement is necessary to drive XRP to a new all-time high. In his view, such events often trap inexperienced traders, causing them to buy high and get \u201cRekt.\u201d Building on this optimistic outlook, the analyst projects that the altcoin will eventually climb to new levels before crashing by up to 90%. Analyst Forecasts Over 250% Surge For XRP In a bold new analysis, Javon Marks, another prominent crypto analyst, shared a bullish outlook for XRP, predicting a potential price surge of over 251% from its current level. According to the market expert, historical price behavior and long-term chart patterns indicate that XRP may be on the cusp of entering its next significant upward leg, with targets set at $9.631. Related Reading: XRP Price About To Explode: XRPBTC Could Repeat 2017 Fractal Notably, XRP\u2019s bullish target is not confined to this level.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/analyst-sounds-the-alarm-shiba-inu-primed-for-over-1500-breakout/",
      "summary": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) might be on the verge of a powerful rally, according to crypto analyst MasterAnanda, who believes the popular meme coin could climb more than 1,500% in this cycle. The analyst predicts SHIB may cancel another zero and reach a new all-time high if a few key levels are cleared. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape Signs Of A Possible Reversal SHIB has been stuck in a downtrend since March 2024. It peaked at $0.000045 before sliding back to close that month at $0.000030. Since then, the coin has moved within a descending triangle pattern, bouncing around the base while facing strong bearish pressure. However, something may be changing. SHIB has just printed a fully green weekly candle and gained 15% over the past seven days. According to analysts, this is one of the most bullish weekly moves since early May, when the token jumped 25%. Despite the optimism, SHIB remains below its 200-day moving average, which sits at $0.000016. That&#8217;s around 19% higher than its current price of $0.000013. Analysts see this as a critical level the token must beat to confirm a long-term bullish trend. Bullish Price Targets Appear On The Chart MasterAnanda believes SHIB will break above the triangle and make a run toward $0.000032, aligning with the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level. If that plays out, the analyst sees a further move to $0.000067, then to $0.00010, which would represent a new all-time high. From there, two more possible targets have emerged using Fibonacci extensions: $0.00017 and $0.00022. Those would mark gains of 1,180% and 1,529%, respectively. While ambitious, other analysts have also supported a similar price path based on the same descending triangle breakout. Shiba Inu Sentiment Mixed As Greed Index Climbs Although bullish targets are grabbing headlines, market sentiment is still uncertain. Based on recent data, SHIB recorded green days on just 13 out of the last 30, and showed 4.25% price volatility. The current reading for sentiment is &#8220;Neutral&#8221; and the Fear &#38; Greed Index stands at 69, which is in the &#8220;Greed&#8221; category. Price prediction tools indicate that SHIB could increase 27% to August 10, 2025, at about $0.000017. That will bring it nearer to its MA-200, but still far from the lofty targets being predicted by some analysts. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason SHIB holders are now waiting to see what&#8217;s next. Will the triangle breakout occur in a hurry, or will resistance levels hold the token below major technicals? The coming weeks may provide the answers.

However, maintaining the price above the key moving averages will be crucial for the continuation of this bullish run. Volume Spikes Confirm Breakout Strength According to Gemxbt&#8217;s post on X, the SUI 1-hour chart is showing a strong uptrend, with the price trading above the 5, 10, and 20-day moving averages, which is a sign of short-term momentum and sustained buyer strength. Related Reading: SUI Prints Classic Reversal Setup With Triple Top Formation The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, which warns of a potential short-term pullback and suggests that traders should be cautious of a temporary pause as the market digests recent gains. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is bullish with a widening gap between the MACD line and the signal line. This expansion often precedes continuation in trending markets and confirms that momentum is accelerating. Trading volume has increased notably alongside price movement. The rising volume during an uptrend suggests that the move is a genuine market participation. Analyst LORD ATU also stated that SUI is trading at $2.90 on the daily chart, with a solid 9.69% weekly gain, and showing clear signs of bullish momentum. The price action falling wedge pattern is typically a bullish continuation signal with a potential target at $3.20, and if confirmed with volume, a breakout will follow through. However, a bearish head and shoulders formation is also beginning to emerge, which is signaling a potential drop toward the $2.30 support zone, which is a level of prior structure and support. LORD ATU noted that the key levels to watch out for are the support at $2.88, which is a crucial short-term floor that must hold to maintain the uptrend, and resistance at $3.15, where a clear break could trigger momentum higher. The SUI ecosystem growth looks strong, with increasing development activity and solid fundamentals. However, an upcoming token unlock could introduce fresh supply pressure and volatility. Momentum Accelerates After Consolidation Phase Another Analyst, Profit Demon, also mentioned on X that SUI has completed a bullish flag pattern breakout on the 3-day chart, which is signaling a shift in market sentiment after a period of consolidation. This continuation pattern often marks the end of sideways movement and the resumption of an existing uptrend.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/99bitcoins-q2-report-unveils-whats-powering-2025-crypto-boom/",
      "summary": "The crypto market has been on a tear in 2025, and the latest 99Bitcoins Q2 State of Crypto Market Report, authored by Manisha Mishra and sponsored by KCEX, lays it all out. The quarter saw institutional demand surge, Bitcoin ($BTC) hit a then-ATH of $111,980, and crypto hiring spike 753%. Despite the rally, the total market cap was still 12% below its $3.7 trillion peak, hinting at room to run. With stablecoin adoption booming and long-term holders stacking, Q2 may have been the real start of this cycle\u2019s breakout. Read the full report here: State of Crypto Q2 2025 \u2013 99Bitcoins A Record-Breaking Quarter for Bitcoin Bitcoin lit up Q2 with a 25.66% gain, smashing past resistance to hit a then-record $111,980 on May 22. That put it well ahead of gold\u2019s 7.21% rise and most equity indices, marking a sharp reversal from Q1\u2019s pullback. According to 99Bitcoins\u2019 Q2 report, the rally was driven by institutional inflows, ETF demand, and growing sovereign interest, with governments now holding 2.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply. Meanwhile, spot ETF flows consistently outpaced miner issuance, tightening supply just as demand surged. Chris Wright of 21Shares summed it up: \u201cWe believe that Bitcoin ETFs will attract 50% more inflows this year compared to last year. This would result in net inflows of approximately $55 billion in 2025, representing an increase of around $20 billion year-over-year.\u201d A golden cross in late May confirmed the uptrend, following a clean breakout from months of consolidation. It\u2019s a textbook bullish structure. With price action and fundamentals in sync, Q2 marked the clearest shift yet: Bitcoin is back, but powered by institutions, not retail. Institutions Took the Wheel, Retail Turned to Altcoins According to the 99Bitcoins report, this bull run has a different driver behind the wheel. And it\u2019s not Reddit. 9 out of 10 experts interviewed in the Q2 report said retail traders have shifted their focus to the best altcoins, chasing faster gains while institutions quietly accumulated Bitcoin. The on-chain data backs it up. Glassnode shows that 30% of $BTC\u2019s supply is now held by centralized entities, with large players dominating inflows. Meanwhile, Google Trends reveals that retail interest in \u201cBitcoin\u201d searches stayed surprisingly low throughout Q2, even as $BTC hit new highs. Confidence among long-term holders also climbed. UTXO activity dropped, and the amount of BTC in long-term storage kept rising. A sign that serious capital isn\u2019t looking to sell anytime soon. Stablecoins and DeFi Picked Up Steam If Q2 proved anything, it\u2019s that stablecoins aren\u2019t just stable, they\u2019re also scaling. The Circle IPO popped 168% on day one, marking the first stablecoin issuer to go public and signaling TradFi\u2019s growing appetite for crypto exposure without the volatility. According to 99Bitcoins, 81% of crypto-aware SMBs now want to use stablecoins for daily ops, and the number of Fortune 500s planning to integrate them has tripled since last year. On the DeFi side, Ethereum ($ETH) held L1 dominance, Chainlink ($LINK) led dev activity, and $HYPE \u2013 the native token of Hyperliquid \u2013 saw serious traction, fueled by the DEX\u2019s rise to 70%+ of all perp DEX volume. While others chased memes, HYPE rallied on actual utility. In short: DeFi\u2019s still cooking, and stablecoins are fueling the fire. Memecoin Mayhem After tanking in Q1, the memecoin market bounced back slightly in Q2, though volatility stayed extreme and price action remained erratic. Q2 saw the meme coins hit new heights, with over 5.9 million new tokens launched and most of them churned out via pump.fun. It was chaotic, noisy, and pure degen energy. While most faded instantly, tokens like $FARTCOIN and $SPX kept riding the wave. That said, the surge in token activity came with a dark side: phishing and wallet-targeted hacks climbed, especially among memecoin holders. Regulatory Wins and Macro Shifts Driving Confidence If Q2 had a theme, it was relief on both the policy and economic fronts. The U.S. pulled back on crypto enforcement, scrapped IRS reporting rules for DeFi, and signaled a more constructive stance overall. Meanwhile, the Fed held rates steady for the fourth straight time, hinting at a possible cut in July. With unemployment flat and growth slowing, capital started flowing into safe-haven assets, and this time, Bitcoin was firmly on that list. The result? Confidence surged. Bitcoin ETF inflows accelerated, volatility dropped, and $BTC\u2019s macro narrative strengthened. It\u2019s no longer just a risk asset; it\u2019s becoming part of the defensive playbook. Elsewhere, $XRP finally closed its long-running legal battle with the SEC, potentially clearing the runway for a new ATH later this year. What\u2019s Next for Q3? Back in Q2, 99Bitcoins forecasted that if BTC could flip $111K\u2013$112K resistance, the path to $120K would open, with $135K as a stretch target. Fast forward to now, and that prediction is aging well: Bitcoin is already trading at above $118K, edging toward that psychological milestone. The report also noted $BTC was holding firm above $103K support, forming a bullish structure backed by rising miner wallet balances, shrinking exchange reserves, and growing illiquid supply \u2013 all signs of confidence from long-term holders. Still, Q3 isn\u2019t without risk. ETF inflows could slow, and macro headwinds, from global conflict to sudden rate hikes, remain on the radar. But if institutional flows stay hot and the Fed delivers a rate cut, $135K no longer feels like a moonshot. It\u2019s just part of the next leg up. Final Thoughts: A Bull Market With Depth The 99Bitcoins Q2 report by Manisha Mishra paints a clear picture: this bull market isn\u2019t built on retail hype. Institutions, regulatory tailwinds, and real product traction are powering it. From ETF inflows to stablecoin adoption and supply-side tightening, the signals all point toward a more mature, resilient crypto cycle. And with Bitcoin already pushing towards $120K, many of the Q2 projections are already playing out. If momentum holds, and macro conditions don\u2019t throw a curveball, Q4 could be the real breakout.

      "title": "Bitcoin Dominance Falls: 9 Factors To Watch For That Says The Altcoin Season Has Begun",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-dominance-falls/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price is holding firm despite growing chatter about the end of its market dominance. However, analysts are turning their attention not to Bitcoin\u2019s price but to its waning market share as signs that altcoins may finally be ready to take center stage in what could become a full-blown altcoin season. A post on X has highlighted a specific breakdown structure in BTC dominance, which is linked to nine factors indicating that the altcoin season has begun. Technical Factors Showing Fall Of Bitcoin Dominance According to the analyst, Bitcoin dominance reached a peak of exactly 66% on June 27, 2025, a date he calls significant for its esoteric code 434 and its occurrence on a new moon. From a technical perspective, the 66% mark coincided precisely with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, a region many traders consider a reversal zone. More importantly, several warning signals are flashing for Bitcoin traders. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says The analyst&#8217;s post on the social media platform X features a few price charts to emphasize how the Bitcoin dominance might be fading, alongside nine factors. From a purely technical lens, the dominance chart looks increasingly exhausted. The first factor is the most recent highest monthly RSI in the history of the Bitcoin dominance chart. This event has created an overbought condition, and the next outlook is a possible crash of the RSI. The MACD, in fact, has already crossed into bearish territory. Furthermore, the histogram has turned negative, and the faster line has moved below the slower one, which is a classic signal of an impending downtrend. Another interesting factor is that Bitcoin dominance has now broken a key diagonal support line that held firm through much of 2024 and 2025, which is another possible structural breakdown. Fundamental Factors Show Strong Rotation Into Altcoin Pairs While the technical picture is deteriorating, the fundamentals are also stacking in favor of altcoins very quickly. The first fundamental factor is the importance of upcoming altcoin spot ETFs, which have the possibility to redirect institutional flows from Bitcoin into Ethereum, XRP, and others. Related Reading: Time To Forget Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance At This Level Is This Only Hope ETFs such as the Spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana ETFs could rapidly increase inflows into the rest of the crypto market, similar to how Spot Bitcoin ETFs caused massive inflows into Bitcoin. The analyst also highlighted the likelihood of upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which would tilt market conditions in favor of altcoins over Bitcoin. Momentum has also begun to shift in some trading pairs, particularly XRP/BTC and ETH/BTC, both of which are showing reversal signs from critical levels. The XRP/BTC chart displays repeated failed attempts to break above 0.0000215 BTC, a horizontal resistance that has now been tested five times on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. At the time of writing, the XRP/BTC pair has returned to this level yet again, and based on this pattern, any clean breakout here could confirm a decisive rotation into XRP. Likewise, Ethereum has begun to recover from long-term oversold conditions when measured against Bitcoin. The rounded bottom pattern forming on the ETH/BTC weekly chart shows a reversal from undervaluation, which in past cycles has caused substantial gains for Ethereum relative to BTC.
