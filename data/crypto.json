      "summary": "DeFi Development Corp. hit a major roadblock this week when the US Securities and Exchange Commission blocked its $1 billion registration filing. The move came after regulators found that the company\u2019s Form S-3 lacked a key internal controls report tied to its 10-K.

That report is a must for any firm raising capital through public offerings. Without it, the commission won\u2019t even consider your request. DeFi Development filed in late April 2025 but overlooked this step, a basic requirement in US securities law.

Solana ranks as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The filing showed some of the $1 billion would go toward staking rewards and token purchases. Staking can earn regular returns, but only if SOL holds or gains value. Putting such a large stake into one chain carries risks if market prices dip. Withdrawal And Next Steps DeFi Development confirmed that no securities were issued during this process. It said it plans to refile once the controls report is in place. A quick resubmission\u2014perhaps within 30 or 45 days\u2014would signal they were almost ready.

What Comes Next DeFi Development\u2019s experience highlights that crypto firms must meet the same rules as any other public issuer. Skipping standard checks can derail even the boldest plans. The company\u2019s next move will show how well it can balance its blockchain ambitions with straightforward regulatory steps.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/will-dogecoin-moon-or-crash-indicator-holds-answer/",
      "summary": "According to market technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) a single metric\u2014the 20-month simple moving average\u2014could be the line that could separate another vertical rally from a gut-wrenching breakdown for Dogecoin. Currently, DOGE sits comfortable above that moving average, now plotted at $0.1751. The black curve on Cat\u2019s chart shows only three clean retests of the 20-month SMA since 2014. All Eyes On Dogecoin\u2019s 20-Month SMA The first came in March 2017, when price tapped the average near $0.00020 and then ripped more than 9,000% into the January 2018 peak. The second occurred in the winter of 2020, with price kissing the average at roughly one-fourth of one cent before the parabolic 34,500% run to $0.73 the following May. The third and current encounter began in August last year when DOGE rallied by more than 480%. As of today, two successive monthly candles dipped into the zone just below twenty-cents, but both were bought aggressively, leaving higher wicks and preserving the upward slope of the average. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as that moving average remains intact, \u201cwe\u2019re going higher.\u201d A decisive monthly close beneath $0.175 would, by this read, place the entire structure at risk and could usher in the sort of multi-month down-trend that followed the 2018 and 2021 climaxes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Moment This Month, Predicts Analyst TOTAL2 Needs To Break Out Analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) overlays that micro view on a much broader canvas. His chart tracks the total crypto market capitalization ex-Bitcoin (TradingView ticker \u201cTOTAL2\u201d) in monthly candles back to 2017. Two bold yellow trend-lines define a seven-year rising channel whose upper rail repelled price at the January 2018 and November 2021 alt-season tops. Since the June 2022 low, the market has carved out an ascending triangle: a rising series of higher lows presses against a flat-topped supply zone between roughly $1.43 trillion and $1.7 trillion. The apex of the triangle now looms; aggregate alt-cap is already worth about $1.2 trillion \u2014 all that stands between the current print and a confirmed breakout is a monthly close above the upper edge of that yellow rectangle. Kevin\u2019s projection measures the height of the pattern and adds it to the breakout level, dropping a vertical marker that intersects the mid-channel near $5.89 trillion. Kevin\u2019s first Fibonacci extensions target is the 1.618 at $4.06 trillion. Higher extensions at 1.886, 2.0 and 2.618 cluster around $4.57 trillion, 5.89 trillion and $6.9 trillion respectively, the last of which coincides almost exactly with the channel\u2019s ceiling and is circled as the analyst\u2019s ultimate upside objective. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Why does that matter for Dogecoin? The meme-coin\u2019s two explosive cycles began only after TOTAL2 had broken its own prior-cycle high and money poured into non-Bitcoin assets. Kevin states that \u201caltcoins are just scratching the surface of what is possible in the coming months,\u201d provided that macro-liquidity and regulatory factors permit capital rotation out of Bitcoin into the wider market. In that scenario the 20-month SMA on DOGE would likely continue to slope higher, setting the stage for an explosive move higher. Conversely, failure of the alt-cap triangle would make a sustained loss of the SMA far more probable, robbing DOGE of its historical launch-pad. For now, the indicator holds\u2014and with it the prospect that Dogecoin could be primed for yet another bout of furious upside. But as both analysts caution, the monthly close will tell the story: above the 20-month SMA and an alt-cap breakout, or below it and back into hibernation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-enters-perfect-setup/",
      "summary": "The XRP price is reportedly positioning for a potential breakout as it forms a textbook Falling Wedge pattern, which a crypto analyst calls a perfect bullish setup. After a successful retest of a keg buy zone, technical indicators suggest that XRP is preparing for a powerful move toward the $3.7 level soon. Falling Wedge Setup Signal XRP Price Breakout XRP is currently entering what Robert Mercer, a TradingView crypto analyst, describes as the perfect breakout setup following a prolonged period of consolidation. This technical structure suggests that XRP could potentially experience a sharp rally from its current price of $2.25 to the $3.70 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Remains Bullish Above $2, This Falling Channel Says $3.8 Is Coming Notably, on the 2-day XRP price chart, Mercer noted that the cryptocurrency has been consolidating within a Falling Wedge pattern since late December 2024. Since establishing a local bottom at $2.11 in the same timeframe, the altcoin has repeatedly tested this bottom level without breaking below it in a sustained manner. The $2.11 price zone has also acted as a reliable horizontal support level throughout the six-month Falling Wedge formation. Meanwhile, XRP\u2019s price action has been gradually compressing within the wedge pattern, indicating reduced volatility and increasing pressure near the wedge apex. Looking at the TradingView analyst\u2019s chart, it appears that XRP is now approaching the Falling Wedge resistance at the upper boundary, which coincides with the $2.45 level, where a buy retest has occurred. This convergence is viewed as a potential confirmation zone. If buying momentum continues and XRP closes decisively above $2.45, the breakout would confirm the end of the Falling Wedge and potentially initiate the cryptocurrency\u2019s next upward move. Mercer highlights that XRP\u2019s current bullish structure is a simple yet perfect setup. And based on this setup, price targets above the wedge are projected in several stages, with $2.98, $3.36 and $3.71 serving as resistance levels based on historical price action and technical extensions. If the breakout holds and buying interest persists, the TradingView expert predicts that XRP may reach the $3.5 &#8211; $4 region over the next three to five months, aligning with past performances following similar wedge breakouts in the market. $1.40 Breakdown Still In Play If Resistance Fails While XRP\u2019s current structure supports a bullish outlook, Mercer\u2018s price chart shows that a failed breakout remains a possibility. If XRP is rejected again at the $2.45 resistance level, it could resume its consolidation within the Falling Wedge pattern. This would place downward pressure on the price and may lead to a retest of lower support zones. Related Reading: Why A Sweep At $2 Is Important For XRP Price To Continue Rallying The most critical support level in this bearish scenario is located around $1.4. While this price level has not been tested directly in recent months, it marks the lower boundary of the Falling Wedge pattern. A breakdown below this level could invalidate the XRP\u2019s wedge and bullish setup. It may also indicate a possible shift in market structure from consolidation to bearish continuation, which could result in further downside.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-tests-previous-resistance-as-support-can-bulls-defend-this-level/",
      "summary": "Ethereum finally pushed above the long-watched $2,800 mark, signaling renewed strength and triggering a wave of optimism across the market. However, the breakout was met with heavy volatility, as the price quickly pulled back into the previous resistance zone. Despite the rejection, ETH continues to trade near the top of its range, and analysts remain bullish on the broader altcoin outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance \u2013 Breakout Or Breakdown? With Bitcoin stabilizing near all-time highs and ETH attempting to reclaim momentum, many are calling for the start of a new altseason. Ethereum\u2019s performance is viewed as a critical signal for the broader altcoin market \u2014 and for now, the structure remains intact. Bulls are watching closely to see if ETH can bounce and retest the breakout zone with strength. Top analyst M-log1 shared a technical update, noting that ETH is currently sitting at key support levels. He emphasized the importance of a clean bounce and a breakout from the current ascending channel. While M-log1 isn\u2019t calling for a breakdown yet, he highlighted the need for caution and patience as price action unfolds. For now, Ethereum holds support, but the next move will be crucial. Ethereum Leads With Strength But Volatility Keeps Market On Edge Ethereum is currently leading the crypto market, showing relative strength as it holds above key price levels despite a backdrop of volatility and global uncertainty. Trading above $2,750, ETH has become a focal point for investors who see it as the leading indicator for a potential altcoin rally. However, recent price swings have introduced a wave of caution, as traders weigh the risk of a pullback against the promise of a breakout. Macroeconomic headwinds remain a critical factor. Global tensions, rising US Treasury yields, and uncertain trade negotiations between the US and major economies continue to drive investor sentiment. These external pressures have kept volatility high and market conviction relatively fragile, even as Ethereum maintains its structure above support. M-log1 shared a technical breakdown, noting that ETH is now sitting at a key support zone near $2,750. According to him, Ethereum \u201cneeds to bounce and break out of the current ascending channel\u201d to reignite upside momentum. If that fails, the structure may tilt bearish, with a potential revisit of the lower end of the channel. He added that while he remains optimistic, probabilities shift quickly in this environment, and the next few sessions will be critical. Still, Ethereum\u2019s relative strength amid macro noise suggests underlying confidence. If ETH can reclaim the $2,800\u2013$2,830 region and flip it into support, it could pave the way for a run toward $3,000 and set the tone for altseason. Until then, price action remains compressed, and the market watches closely as Ethereum teeters at a technical and psychological pivot point. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Ethereum Holds Key Levels As Price Tests Critical Moving Averages Ethereum is trading at $2,753 on the 3-day chart, showing strength after pushing above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,768.62. While ETH briefly reached a high of $2,785, the candle currently reflects a slight pullback from that level. This rejection is not yet a bearish signal, but it does mark the $2,770\u2013$2,785 range as a short-term resistance zone. ETH remains well-positioned technically, holding above the 50-day ($2,325), 100-day ($2,647), and 200-day ($2,768) SMAs \u2014 all critical levels that have historically guided mid- to long-term price direction. The strong rally from April lows around $1,500 to current levels has reset the trend in Ethereum\u2019s favor, but now a clean breakout above $2,800 is needed to confirm continuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level \u2013 Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Volume remains steady, with no major signs of distribution. A strong close above the 200 SMA on this 3-day candle could act as a bullish confirmation and set the stage for a push toward the $3,000 mark. On the downside, if ETH fails to hold $2,700, a retest of the $2,600\u2013$2,650 support zone is likely. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-sentiment-explodes-while-bitcoin-hyper-soars-best-presale-in-2025/",
      "summary": "There\u2019s much ado about Bitcoin these days. After notching a new all-time of $111.9K on May 22, 2025, $BTC has been trading back and forth below that mark, never falling below $100K. But usually holding sideways between $105K-$110K. But Bitcoin sentiment is beginning to build again. Will it lead to a new push for the market? If so, then the aptly-named Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale could gain the most as Bitcoin&#8217;s first Layer-2 implementing the Solana Virtual Machine. Long-Time HODLers Selling at $100K One reason for the recent selling pressure might be long-term Bitcoin hodlers finally choosing to sell. Early investors who bought Bitcoin when the price was a few thousand (Bitcoin was below $10K only a few years ago, on July 1, 2020) might be finally ready to cash out now that $BTC has gone 10x or more from their original investment. Is that a bad sign for Bitcoin investors? Not necessarily. A potential tightening of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply will likely offset the increased selling pressure. On-chain data supports that conclusion, as the amount of exchange-held Bitcoins has steadily fallen, even as Bitcoin\u2019s price rises. In fact, only weakening demand may have kept $BTC\u2019s price down so far. And that\u2019s not likely to continue forever. Bitwise CEO: \u2018No One Is Going To Sell\u2019 Once Bitcoin Breaks Through Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley thinks that tightening supply will only worsen once Bitcoin breaks through $130K-$150K. At that point, the HODLers will return, diamond hands and everything. If he\u2019s correct, then the issue of tightening supply will kick in harder than ever. And the first and perhaps only immutable law of economics \u2013 supply and demand \u2013 could supercharge Bitcoin\u2019s price. Institutional investors being more bullish than ever also helps the narrative, even as retail investors go back-and-forth with Bitcoin. Take GameStop, which recently purchased 4.7K Bitcoin and plans to offer $1.75B of convertible notes to potentially fund more purchases. A recent Santiment report shows that Bitcoin positivity is returning in the community, with positive comments outweighing the negative by more than 2-1. Growing Bitcoin hype means at least one thing: $BTC-centric presales like Bitcoin Hyper could grow big \u2013 fast. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Unlock Fast, Cheap Bitcoin Transactions with First Bitcoin Layer 2 More than a store of value; with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Bitcoin can finally be everything it was meant to be \u2013 the home of crypto payments, meme coins, dApps, and smart contracts. The technical framework for Bitcoin Hyper is straightforward; with the Bitcoin Relay Program, any $BTC deposited to a specific Bitcoin address can be minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2. That Layer 2 leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for better throughput and increased scalability, and sets $HYPER up to be one of the strongest crypto presales so far in 2025. The end result is a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) equipped Layer 2, trustless but fully synced to the Bitcoin Layer 1 blockchain. $HYPER, the native token for the Bitcoin Layer 2, provides a number of benefits for $HYPER chain users. Those benefits include: Low gas fees, paid in $HYPER Staking rewards, currently 647% APY Participation incentives Developer bounties Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s presale rocketed out of the gate, passing $1M raised in a matter of days. Token currently cost $0.01185, with $1.13M raised so far. That price could reach $0.02595 by the end of 2025 (for a 118% increase), according to our price prediction. Buy into the $HYPER, and join a community of visionaries who want to transform Bitcoin&#8217;s position in the dApp industry. Bullish Outlook Means Growing Demand for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper As $BTC supply tightens, demand will only increase. That should fuel a further increase for both $BTC and related projects, like a groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer 2. And if you consider $HYPER&#8217;s utility is all about making Bitcoin more prepared for the adoption ahead, the project&#8217;s potential in the market becomes beyond clear. Remember, always do your own research; this isn\u2019t financial advice. &#160;"
