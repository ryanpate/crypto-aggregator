      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-mvrv-oscillator-predicts-first-sell-pressure-level-at-130900-details/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has officially broken through its previous all-time high of $112,000, surging to $118,000 just hours ago and entering uncharted territory for the first time since late May. The breakout confirms bullish momentum after weeks of consolidation and failed attempts, with price action now showing clear strength. With the psychological and technical barrier of $112K cleared, many analysts believe this move could mark the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s next expansive rally. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level \u2013 Relief Or Reversal? Bulls are firmly in control, and on-chain metrics support this breakout narrative. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands currently stand at 2.25. Historically, Bitcoin enters the overheated zone around 3.0 or higher, suggesting there is still room for growth before reaching excessive valuation territory. This metric, which measures the deviation between market price and realized value, helps identify when BTC is overbought or undervalued relative to past performance. At current levels, the data points to continued upside potential without major overheating concerns, fueling confidence that this breakout could extend further. Bitcoin Enters Expansion Phase As Market Eyes $130K After weeks of tight consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, signaling the start of a new market phase. The breakout above previous highs has reignited investor optimism, not only for BTC but also for the broader altcoin market, with many altcoins now pushing above key resistance levels for the first time in months. This move comes amid growing anticipation of a weakening US dollar and renewed inflationary pressures as Washington adopts looser fiscal policies. The market is increasingly pricing in the effects of tax cuts, high government spending, and dovish political rhetoric\u2014all of which create a favorable environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. Still, the macro backdrop is not without risks. US Treasury yields remain elevated, flashing warnings of underlying systemic stress in credit markets. This tension underscores the fragility of the current rally and the importance of monitoring fundamental shifts. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights using the MVRV oscillator, a model that compares Bitcoin\u2019s market value to its realized value. According to Adler, historical data over the last four years suggests that when MVRV reaches 2.75, Bitcoin tends to face its first wave of meaningful selling pressure. If the same pattern holds true in this cycle, Bitcoin could reach approximately $130,900 before seeing notable profit-taking activity. While the current MVRV reading remains below that threshold, the model offers a clear signal of where long-term holders may begin offloading. Until then, the breakout sets the stage for a potential leg higher, with bulls now in control, pushing toward price discovery and a possible test of the $130K zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason BTC Enters Uncharted Territory With Strong Momentum Bitcoin has officially broken into price discovery after blasting through its all-time high resistance near $112,000. The 3-day chart shows a massive bullish candle pushing BTC up to $118,683, representing an 8.94% gain in the last session. This breakout is the first clear sign of a strong bullish continuation after weeks of sideways consolidation below key resistance. The chart highlights a textbook breakout structure. BTC respected the $103,600 and $109,300 support zones multiple times throughout May and June before finally gaining enough momentum to pierce through the upper resistance. The recent surge came with a noticeable spike in volume, adding confidence to the breakout\u2019s sustainability. Moving averages also confirm the bullish trend. The 50, 100, and 200 SMA lines remain aligned upward with increasing separation, suggesting that market structure remains strong and trend continuation is likely. Bitcoin is now trading well above all major moving averages, reinforcing the strength of the rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape With no historical resistance levels above, BTC enters a price discovery phase. The next psychological target for bulls will likely be $120,000, followed by the MVRV-based resistance level around $130,900. As long as BTC holds above $112K, the momentum remains decisively in favor of the bulls. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s up nearly 8.5% this week, approaching $120K and clocking over $123B in 24h volume. But now, the real volatility (and upside) is rotating into the best altcoins. Traders are chasing faster gains down the cap table (memes, AI tokens, new L1s), and Kraken\u2019s making those trades easier to find and execute. If you\u2019re looking for what\u2019s next, not what already happened, Kraken\u2019s where you start. Altcoin Rotation Is Heating Up Bitcoin&#8217;s ripping, but Ethereum\u2019s catching up fast. $ETH is up over 17% this week and now flirting with the $3K mark. Historically, when $ETH gains momentum, the altcoin floodgates tend to open, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. BTC dominance is also slipping below 65%, a key signal that traders are rotating into higher-beta plays. On Kraken, it\u2019s not just the best meme coins flying. In the past 24 hours, Omni ($OMNI) pumped +174%, Matchain ($MAT) +66%, and Dolomite ($DOLO) +53.35%. Even coins like Renzo ($REX), Initia ($INIT), and Unicorn Fart Dust ($UFD) are putting up 30\u201350% days. With many low-cap, high-velocity tokens, Kraken gives you the first shot at these rotations before the crowd catches on. Kraken Moves with the Market In the past three days alone, Kraken has listed $HBAR, $TANSSI, and $EPT. These additions align perfectly with what traders are rotating into: AI, Layer 2 (L2) infrastructure, and real-world asset plays. That speed and narrative alignment isn\u2019t a fluke. Kraken just climbed to #2 globally in Kaiko\u2019s Q2 2025 Exchange Rankings, a data-driven benchmark that weighs market quality, regulatory strength, liquidity, and transparency. Kraken scored high across the board, particularly on depth and execution reliability \u2013 two pillars that matter most when chasing volatile small caps. For traders trying to stay in sync with the flow of capital, Kraken is a front-row seat to what\u2019s next. Built for the Way You Trade Altcoins Catching altcoin moves isn\u2019t just about spotting the right tokens. It\u2019s about having the tools to act on them fast. With 452+ listed assets, Kraken exposes you to everything from the best low-cap coins to AI, L2s, and real-world asset plays, all in one place. Kraken lets you buy instantly using bank transfers, cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PayPal. So you\u2019re never stuck on the sidelines when the market starts moving. You can go long on a momentum play, hedge it with 300+ derivatives, or stake your bags across 20+ supported assets, including newer staking listings like $SUI. Need flexibility? Kraken offers up to 5x margin and consistently deep liquidity, with 88% of 2024 orders filling at the top of the book, minimizing slippage when every second counts. For altcoin traders also tracking macro trends, Kraken\u2019s xStocks expansion brings tokenized equities like TSLA, AAPL, and SPY into play, bridging TradFi and crypto in real time. Alt Season Needs a Platform Bitcoin lit the fuse, but the real action is in altcoins. With capital rotating fast and new narratives popping up daily, you need a platform that keeps up. Kraken&#8217;s deep listings, fast access to new tokens, and pro-grade trading tools give you everything you need to execute quickly and confidently when a window opens.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-chart-one-of-the-best-crypto/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin hovered near $0.20 on Friday, nursing a weekly gain of about 17 percent and a 24-hour trading volume above $2 billion as traders digested a late-June livestream by technical analyst Kevin, who argued that the meme-coin\u2019s structure \u201chas to be one of the best-looking altcoin charts out there.\u201d Dogecoin Double Bottom Could Trigger $1 During the one-hour session Kevin highlighted a textbook double-bottom that printed on Dogecoin\u2019s weekly chart exactly at the confluence of the 200-week simple and exponential moving averages, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the 2023\u20132025 advance, and a long-term up-trend line dating back to the 2022 bear-market trough. Entering at that zone, he said, \u201cthe risk-reward here is phenomenal,\u201d noting that a tight stop just below the cluster implied limited downside while upside targets stretched toward the previous cycle\u2019s highs. Kevin told viewers the weekly momentum profile supports a larger breakout. Money-flow on Market Cipher is curling higher for the first time in more than a year; the MACD is preparing to cross bullish from a higher low; and the stochastic RSI has turned up from mid-range. On the monthly chart, relative strength continues to print higher highs and higher lows, and the stock-RSI \u201cis hanging on, ready to push back up,\u201d he said, adding that the entire structure \u201clooks freakin\u2019 great\u201d for a sustained move once Bitcoin clears its own resistance band near $116,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It\u2019s No Meme His price map for the coming months begins with a purple resistance box between $0.94 and $1.31\u2014the 2021 peak plus the 1.618 extension of the 2022\u201324 base. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty shocked if Dogecoin can\u2019t at least tag 94 cents,\u201d Kevin said, stressing that a decisive break of a dollar would likely attract a new wave of retail traders and algorithmic trend-followers. He stopped short of offering an end-of-cycle target, but insisted \u201c$1 remains likely,\u201d conditional on Bitcoin extending toward the $150,000 region and\u2014crucially\u2014on macro tail-winds such as an end to quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. Even so, Kevin warned against complacency. Dogecoin\u2019s intraday spike coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s test of a major Fib cluster at $116,000, while USDT dominance hit golden-pocket support\u2014levels that could spark a near-term cooldown. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by green candles,\u201d he said, reminding viewers that meme-coins \u201ccan get crushed even in bull markets\u201d and advising strict risk management: take partial profits after big thrusts, move stops to break-even, and \u201crinse and repeat.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Beyond pure chart work, Kevin framed Dogecoin as a perpetual beneficiary of retail psychology. \u201cYou can walk into any gas station and someone owns Doge,\u201d he quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s the retail darling\u2014it always will be\u2014especially when new money shows up with deeper pockets than last time.\u201d For now, price action is validating that thesis. If the double-bottom holds and macro conditions align, the analyst argues, Dogecoin could once again headline the next alt-season\u2014this time with a dollar tag that traders in the last cycle could only meme about.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/research-160000-bitcoin-eoy-if-treasury-firms-hold/",
      "summary": "A sweeping new research report by Ben Harvey and Will Clemente III, commissioned by market maker Keyrock, projects that Bitcoin could reach $160,000 by the end of 2025\u2014but only if the capital structure supporting Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTC-TCs) remains intact. The research, \u201cBTC Treasuries Uncovered: Premiums, Leverage, and the Sustainability of Proxy Exposure,\u201d dissects the capital structures, market impact, and debt profiles of the fast-growing cohort of \u201cBitcoin Treasury Companies\u201d (BTC-TCs), led by Strategy (the renamed MicroStrategy). The Impact Of Bitcoin Treasury Firms Harvey and Clemente open with a startling figure: \u201cBitcoin Treasury Companies have accumulated around 725,000 BTC, equivalent to 3.64 percent of the entire BTC supply.\u201d Much of that hoard sits with Strategy\u2019s 597,000-coin trove, but the analysts track more than a dozen follow-on players\u2014from Marathon Digital and Metaplanet to newer entrants such as Twenty One Capital\u2014whose combined exposure now outstrips US spot-ETF holdings by more than half. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Yet the report\u2019s headline forecast is explicitly conditional. Keyrock\u2019s bull case assigns a thirty-percent probability that global liquidity remains flush, institutional demand accelerates, and Bitcoin rallies fifty percent past today\u2019s levels, \u201cpushing BTC to over $160 k by EOY.\u201d That outcome rests on the fragile flywheel of net-asset-value premiums: BTC-TC equities still trade, on average, at a seventy-three-percent premium to the dollar value of the coins they custody. Those premiums let boards issue new shares \u201caccretively,\u201d convert sentiment into fresh BTC, and\u2014crucially\u2014service the $33.7 billion in debt and preferred stock the sector has rung up to fund its buying binge. No company illustrates the reflexive loop better than Strategy. Since August 2020, Michael Saylor has driven Bitcoin-per-share (BPS) up eleven-fold, an annualized sixty-three-percent run rate that dwarfs the 6.7 percent CAGR needed to justify the firm\u2019s current ninety-one-percent NAV premium. \u201cIf an investor believes that Strategy\u2019s BPS growth rates will hold long-term,\u201d the authors contend, \u201cholding MSTR would be far more beneficial in BTC terms than holding spot BTC.\u201d Still, that calculus assumes the equity premium stays afloat; if sentiment turns, dilution flips from accretive to punitive overnight. Debt maturities pose the next stress point. BTC-TCs owe a wall of convertible notes in 2027-28. Harvey and Clemente calculate that Strategy alone has issued $8.2 billion of the cohort\u2019s $9.5 billion in debt; Marathon follows at $1.3 billion. Most instruments carry zero-to-low coupons and conversion prices well below current share levels, but a deep Bitcoin drawdown could drive equities under those strikes, forcing firms to repay in cash or refinance at far harsher terms. \u201cSince many BTC-TC valuations are tightly correlated to Bitcoin price performance,\u201d the authors warn, \u201ca sharp BTC drawdown could drive down equity value, increasing the risk that conversion thresholds are breached.\u201d Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000\u2014Is History Repeating? The report splits the universe into cash-flow-generative names such as Metaplanet, CoinShares, and Boyaa Interactive\u2014each with eight or more quarters of runway\u2014and capital-dependent players like Marathon, Nakamoto, and DeFi Technologies, which could face dilution above three percent per quarter merely to stay solvent if premiums persist. Should those premiums compress, equity issuance \u201cbecomes purely dilutive,\u201d and treasury companies could be forced to sell Bitcoin, undermining the proxy thesis that justifies their existence. The Base Case Keyrock\u2019s base case, to which it assigns the highest probability, envisions Bitcoin finishing 2025 around $135,000, with NAV premiums cooling into a thirty-to-sixty-percent range. In that environment, well-managed treasuries still out-perform spot, but the leverage trade loses its shine. The bear scenario\u2014assigned the lowest but non-trivial odds\u2014combines a twenty-percent Bitcoin drawdown with a glut of new treasury listings that flood the market with supply. In that world, premiums vanish, refinancing windows slam shut, and \u201cthe entire investment case for BTC-TCs comes under pressure.\u201d Harvey and Clemente do not dismiss the BTC-TC model; rather, they frame it as a high-beta overlay that amplifies both the upside and the solvency risk inherent in Bitcoin itself. They credit Saylor\u2019s \u201cBitcoin yield\u201d thesis\u2014using premium-funded share issuance to compound coin holdings\u2014as a demonstrably effective strategy to date, but caution that it relies on a delicate equilibrium of bullish sentiment, cheap capital, and meticulous execution. \u201cThe premium to NAV is of the utmost importance here,\u201d the study concludes, \u201cassuming a BTC-TC doesn\u2019t have a core operating business that can cover debt payments, or is entirely free of debt payments altogether.\u201d Whether Bitcoin can sprint to $160,000 by 31 December hinges less on hash-rate projections or macro modeling than on the continued faith of equity investors willing to pay a dollar-fifty for a dollar of embedded BTC. If those investors blink\u2014if premiums fade or convertible maturities collide with a broad risk-off shift\u2014the leverage that has propelled treasury companies to date could flip, turning \u201cone of the best performing equities on the planet\u201d into the market\u2019s most crowded exit. For now, Keyrock\u2019s research leaves readers with a simple countdown: hold the line, and the path to price discovery remains intact; lose it, and the proxy trade could unwind long before the New Year\u2019s fireworks.

      "title": "Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here\u2019s What Happened Last Time",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-open-interest-climbs/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin open interest has risen rapidly once again, with the price pushing above previous peaks to new all-time highs. The BTC price has also stayed over the $100,000 mark for an extended period of time, triggering a new wave of confidence that the cryptocurrency has found its bottom. This has led to crypto traders making their bets and driving the open interest up, pushing it back above December 2024 levels and May 2025 peaks. Bitcoin Open Interest Crosses $70 Billion Again Back in December 2024, the Bitcoin open interest had recorded a new milestone after the volume rose to over $70 billion, marking a new all-time high at the time. The Bitcoin price had also risen sharply at this time and was able to hit $100,000 for the first time in history, triggering even more interest in the asset. Related Reading: Last Crash Before The Surge: Why Bitcoin Is Set To Drop Below $107,000 However, once both the price and the open interest hit these milestones, it wasn\u2019t long before the shorters began to take over the market. The Bitcoin price quickly plummeted back down below $100,000, and over the next few months, open interest would crash back down to the $40 billion territory, resulting in a 40% loss by May 2025. Now, once again, the Bitcoin open interest has crossed the $70 billion mark, sitting close to the $77 billion peak recorded back in May 2025, data from Coinglass shows. In the same vein, the BTC price has been able to maintain above $100,000 and has hit a new all-time high of $117,000. Going by historical performance, it is likely that the Bitcoin price will continue to rise from here, but this break to new all-time highs could carry bearish implications. This is because it is possible that the trend from December 2024 could play out once again. If this happens, then the Bitcoin price could retrace after hitting new highs, an expected correction as shorts pile up.
