      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-breaks-higher/",
      "summary": "Bankr, in a recent update, pointed out that Ethereum is maintaining its upward momentum, backed by solid volume and a more favorable news environment. Although brief spikes in volatility may arise from macroeconomic events, Bankr believes the broader trend remains intact, as long as $2,510 holds. Ethereum Three-Day Price Trend Action Analyzing price action over the last 72 hours, Bankr noted a gently rising three-day trend. ETH started near $2,535, spiked to $2,598, and is now holding around $2,571 \u2014 a gain of roughly +1.5% for the period. The strongest push came Sunday night when ETH jumped $50 in one hour on the heaviest volume of the week. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gathers Strength \u2014 Bulls Prepare for Upside Extension Since then, the price has been consolidating in a tight $2,565\u2013$2,585 range. On the candle side, higher lows are visible at $2,506, $2,512, $2,540, and $2,560, which shows buyers are stepping in a little earlier on each dip. Examining simple indicators, Bankr noted that the 20-hour moving average is approximately $2,565, with the price sitting just above it \u2014 a mildly positive sign. The 50-hour moving average is around $2,538 and still shows a sloping upward trend bias, while candles stay above $2,540. For momentum, a quick RSI-style check shows ETH touched overbought during the $2,598 spike, then cooled to neutral (50\u201355), which leaves room for another leg higher. As for key levels, Bankr outlined support at $2,550 (recent pivot), $2,510 (volume shelf), and $2,480 (weekly floor). On the resistance side, levels to watch include $2,590\u2013$2,600 (last high) and $2,625 (March swing high). News Impact And Game Plan While Ethereum surges, a stronger-than-expected US jobs report typically acts as a headwind, since it implies the Fed will likely stay on hold. However, Bankr noted that crypto appears to be shrugging it off, thanks to a solid risk appetite that&#8217;s keeping momentum intact despite the macro pressure. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup \u2013 Here\u2019s Why BTC Holds The Key On the political front, Bankr highlighted that next week\u2019s US \u201cCrypto Week\u201d in Congress, combined with the administration\u2019s pro-crypto stance, is lifting sentiment. Traders are now positioning ahead of potential developments, including clearer regulatory direction and ETH-related ETF chatter, both of which are helping boost confidence. In terms of sector dynamics, Bankr pointed to ongoing institutional accumulation from players like Metaplanet. Additionally, Bankr mentioned the recent USDC burn, which reflects responsible supply management and supports a more constructive backdrop for Ethereum. Outlining a flexible approach, Bankr points to the accumulation of dips, placing laddered limit buys at $2,555, $2,535, and $2,505 in case of a sharp shakeout. For a breakout trade, if ETH closes an hourly candle above $2,600, look to enter or add with a short-term target at $2,625\u2013$2,650, and place a stop just under $2,580. As a protective exit, if ETH drifts below $2,510 on rising volume, momentum likely shifts, cutting exposure or using a stop around $2,495 can help limit drawdowns. For profit-taking, Bankr suggests trimming partial positions at $2,590 and again near $2,625, while leaving a runner in case a summer rally extends toward $2,700.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/400m-crypto-seizure-by-secret-service-highlights-why-cold-storage-and-best-wallet-are-essential/",
      "summary": "The U.S. Secret Service has now seized over $400M in digital assets, all of which are stored in a single cold wallet, making it one of the largest cold wallet crypto stashes around. It\u2019s worth noting that these assets have been recovered over a period of 10 years by tracking and neutralizing online cryptocurrency scams. Global crypto scams totaled around $16.6B in 2024 alone, with Americans losing a chunky $9.3B. Out of this, older adults were hit the hardest, losing nearly $2.8B. Read on as we dig into how these scams are executed and how the Secret Service works to neutralize them. We\u2019ll also explain why using a secure, non-custodial crypto wallet like Best Wallet (powered by $BEST) is absolutely critical to keeping your crypto safe. How Are Cryptocurrency Scams Neutralized? Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the U.S. Secret Service, shed light on how these scams operate and how they neutralize them. In one instance, scammers used photos of attractive individuals to lure unsuspecting investors into seemingly legitimate cryptocurrency websites, often complete with sleek design and dedicated support teams to build trust. Initial deposits would yield small profits, which encouraged the victims to keep investing. Eventually, the platform would stop working, and the account balance would disappear into thin air. Jamie\u2019s team traced the fake investment site\u2019s domain using open source tools to uncover details like registration time and ownership. When they tracked the domain purchase, it led them to a crypto wallet, and a brief VPN failure finally helped expose the scammer\u2019s IP address. A large part of these takedowns also depends on cooperation from industry players like Tether and Coinbase. In fact, Tether helped the Secret Service recover $225M worth of $USDT in what was one of the largest crypto scam busts to date. All of this underscores the importance of using a secure crypto storage solution like Best Wallet. By giving you total control of your assets and keeping them safe from phishing and fraud, Best Wallet ensures you don\u2019t fall prey to a crypto hack. What is Best Wallet? As mentioned above, Best Wallet is a free crypto wallet that&#8217;s completely self-custodial. This simply means that you and only you will have access to your wallet\u2019s private keys, ensuring that no third party, not even Best Wallet&#8217;s employees, can access your wallet or the funds therein. Along with this, Best Wallet also comes with excellent 2FA/MFA options, allowing you to set up a second one-time password for access to your account. Here, you have the option to use biometric authentication, which is one of the safest and most sought-after 2FA measures. What&#8217;s more, Best Wallet leverages advanced cryptographic technology to protect you and your stored crypto against theft, hacks, and other malicious crypto attacks, including scams and phishing attempts. Even better, Best Wallet employees verify every token before making it available on their platform, safeguarding you from investing your hard-earned money into scam tokens. That&#8217;s not all, though, as Best Wallet has some exciting upgrades in store. It&#8217;ll soon roll out advanced anti-fraud protection and defenses against sophisticated MEV (Miner Extractable Value) attacks. More Than Just Security: Best Wallet Supercharges Meme Coin Access and Trading One of the most unique features of Best Wallet is that it allows you to buy new meme coins on presale directly from within the app. Usually, even the best crypto wallets will require you to connect to a presale&#8217;s website and complete your purchase from there. However, Best Wallet&#8217;s \u2018Upcoming\u2019 section redefines what simplicity means in the meme coin space by allowing users to buy new meme coins without ever having to leave the app. Furthermore, Best Wallet also plans on offering a full-fledged crypto trading terminal, with limit buy/sell orders, stop-losses, and even dollar cost averaging (DCA). Buy $BEST and Join Best Wallet&#8217;s Success Story With a streamlined approach to meme coin purchases, intuitive mobile-first design, and top-notch security, Best Wallet has everything it needs to achieve its goal of capturing over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027. You can ride this success story by buying Best Wallet Token ($BEST), the project&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. It&#8217;s currently in presale, with over $13.7M already raised, and each token available at a low price of $0.025295. According to our $BEST price prediction, the token can surge around 180% and reach $0.07 by 2030, offering early buyers a chunky return on their investment. Most importantly, $BEST holders get to unlock a slew of ecosystem benefits. These include reduced trading and gas fees, governance rights, staking rewards (currently yielding 100%), and early access to new meme coin launches. To learn more about Best Wallet, check out its official whitepaper. And for all of the latest updates, follow it on X and join its Telegram channel.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-could-hit-35-if-it-captures-a-quarter-of-remittance-market-by-2029/",
      "summary": "XRP slipped to around $2.22 on July 7, marking a quiet session for the token. That price sits well below what many crypto backers think it should be. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details They point to XRP\u2019s speed, its ability to handle thousands of transfers every second, and a growing list of real\u2011world partnerships as reasons it\u2019s undervalued. XRP Eyes A Slice Of Remittance Market According to recent projections, the global remittance industry will swell from $783 billion in 2024 to $833 billion in 2025, growing at about 6.4% a year. That same pace is expected to push the total to roughly $1.06 trillion by 2029. Based on reports, if XRP captures 25% of that market and investors value its network at twice its annual volume\u2014similar to big payments firms\u2014the token\u2019s market cap would hit $534 billion. With about 60 billion XRP in circulation, each coin would be worth $8.90. Source: The Business Research Ripple Expands Global Ties Ripple has been busy lining up deals in places that move lots of money overseas. Brazil, Mexico, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, and the Philippines are all on the list. In these markets, people sending cash home often face high fees and slow transfers. XRP\u2019s consensus system lets banks and money\u2011transfer firms settle payments in seconds, not days. That speed could help push adoption even higher. Legal Clarity Boosts Confidence Based on court rulings, the US now treats XRP sales to retail buyers as not being securities. That change opens the door for more banks and payment companies to jump in without fear of a legal sting. It also gives some larger investors more confidence to hold XRP long term. Purely on network\u2011value math, XRP at $8.89 would already be a four\u2011fold jump from $2.22. But crypto markets often bid up tokens beyond those simple models. If growing adoption brings a 4\u00d7 \u201cdemand premium,\u201d XRP could climb all the way to $35.56 by 2029. That scenario assumes Ripple\u2019s partnerships scale up, regulatory risks stay low, and investors see XRP as a must\u2011have tool for cross\u2011border payments. Related Reading: Brazil\u2019s Central Bank Hacked\u2014$40M In Crypto Washed In Aftermath Key Risks And Variables Nothing is guaranteed. Market sentiment can swing. Token emissions from escrow or new supply changes could hurt the price. And if banks take longer than expected to roll out XRP\u2011based services, demand could lag. On the flip side, more use cases\u2014like tokenized assets or on\u2011demand liquidity\u2014could boost real\u2011world volume and push the price even higher.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-will-reach-20-30/",
      "summary": "Crypto expert XForceGlobal has issued a new bullish forecast for the XRP price, predicting that the third-largest cryptocurrency is gearing up for its biggest rally yet. With the Elliott Wave Theory as the key indicator for this move, the analyst believes that XRP could soon see a potential surge between $20 and $30 this bull cycle. XRP Price Forecasted To Rise To $27 In his video analysis posted on X social media, XForceGlobal predicted that XRP is on the cusp of an explosive breakout to $27. The market expert began his analysis by highlighting that XRP\u2019s volatility has crashed to rock bottom, marking the first time in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history that it has reached such levels. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted 600% XRP Price Rally In 2024 Says Next Leg Up Will Be \u2018Parabolic\u2019 Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading close to all-time highs and has been moving within a tight range between $1.5 and $3.8 for six months. XForceGlobal calls this trade range an \u201cunprecedented price action,\u201d which XRP has never experienced on the macro level. XForceGlobal also noted that XRP\u2019s persistent range-bound trading is likely due to investors refusing to sell off their tokens. He revealed that nearly all momentum indicators are aligning in favor of a move toward new all-time highs. More importantly, signals from the Elliott Wave Theory support that XRP may be on the verge of a powerful breakout soon. Using this theory, XForceGlobal explains that XRP is currently entering Wave 3 after experiencing a five-wave move that triggered a surge from $0.37 to above $2.4, followed by a three-wave correction toward $1.5. The analyst explained that within the Elliott Wave Theory, Wave 3 is typically the strongest and longest wave. As a result, he predicts that the XRP price is likely going to hit an initial target around $16.3 soon, making it significantly more profitable than the historic December breakout, when the cryptocurrency surged from its long-held $0.5 range to above $2. Following the completion of Wave 3, XForceGlobal predicts that XRP will possibly experience a crash toward $6 in Wave 4. After this correction, the cryptocurrency is expected to begin forming Wave 5, which is where its price is projected to skyrocket toward $27. XRP Alternative Bullish Case During his video analysis, XForceGlobal suggested that while XRP could potentially surge to between $20 and $30 in Wave 5, this outcome isn\u2019t guaranteed. If it does not play out, the alternative scenario involves a much longer corrective phase within a flat structure. This is anticipated to be followed by a potential breakout above $4 in Wave 3 before a much powerful rally into the double-digit territory. Related Reading: XRP\u2019s 30% Jump To $2.8: Analyst Says This \u2018Classic Confirmation\u2019 Must Happen First He predicts that once XRP climbs above $4, it could undergo a sharp correction down to $1.56, representing wave c of the five-wave impulse move. Notably, XForceGlobal admitted that it is still challenging to determine which of the two bullish scenarios is more likely to unfold at this time. However, the analyst emphasizes that regardless of which scenario unfolds, XRP will still be aiming for the upside and retesting the $4 level.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xlm-traders-beware-stellars-funding-rate-is-plummeting/",
      "summary": "Stellar Lumens hit a critical support level this week at $0.20, putting the token in a precarious spot. At that price, XLM sits 30% below its peak in May and 60% under its 2024 high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details Based on reports, bears have been piling on, pushing the funding rate into negative territory since early June. If that support gives way, traders warn XLM could slide toward $0.15, a drop of about 35%. Network Activity Up According to Artemis, operations on the Stellar network surged to 197 million in June. Stablecoin supply also reached a record $667 million. Over the past five months, the total value locked in real\u2011world asset tokenization grew to $487 million, helped by new offerings such as the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Market Fund. Those figures suggest healthy demand for on\u2011chain services and asset tokenization inside Stellar\u2019s ecosystem. Funding Rates Down Funding rates in perpetual futures have been negative most days since May. That means more short positions than long ones, with short traders paying long traders to keep their bets in place. XLM\u2019s funding rate hit its lowest point since June 30, pointing to rising bearish sentiment. When funding rates stay deep in the red, it often adds selling pressure as traders brace for steeper losses. The image above shows that XLM funding rates are down on most major exchanges, particularly for stablecoin-margined pairs, data from Coinalyze shows. On\u2011Chain Growth Clashes With Market Mood Nansen data shows the number of transactions rose by 11% over the last seven days to 182 million. Active addresses climbed 10% to 146,700 in the same span. Even so, price action has ignored these gains. XLM fell beneath its 50\u2011day and 100\u2011day Exponential Moving Averages, and momentum appears to favor sellers. Some market watchers suggest that deep negative funding could trigger a short squeeze, turning sentiment around if shorts rush to cover. Chart Patterns Warn Of Drop The daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, with $0.21 forming the lower trendline. That level also marked April\u2019s lows when altcoins broadly sold off. XLM has slipped below the 60% Fibonacci Retracement zone, where many traders expect a bounce. A clean break under the triangle could unleash algorithm\u2011driven orders, sending price toward $0.15. Related Reading: Brazil\u2019s Central Bank Hacked\u2014$40M In Crypto Washed In Aftermath Meanwhile, Stellar\u2019s fundamentals look solid, but technical signals remain bearish. Traders and holders should watch that $0.21 line. A strong rebound there could restore confidence in on\u2011chain strength. On the flip side, a slide through support may spark faster losses. Either way, XLM\u2019s near\u2011term path hinges on that key level. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"
