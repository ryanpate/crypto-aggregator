But by Monday morning in Asia, the leading cryptocurrency topped $101,000 again. Traders are weighing whether this was just a hiccup or the start of a fresh trend. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Source: CoinMarketCap Arthur Hayes Sees Temporary Weakness According to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, the fall is only a short pause. On X, he wrote that \u201cweakness shall pass\u201d and predicted Bitcoin will \u201cleave no doubt as to its safe haven status.\u201d He said fresh money printing by central banks will be the main force driving prices back up. His view suggests that big dips can turn into buying chances when broader liquidity is rising. Do you hear that? \u2026 it\u2019s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status. pic.twitter.com/PTfZaAXFp7 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 22, 2025 Market Dips On Geopolitical News Based on reports, it was US strikes on Iran that triggered the initial slide. The price drop happened late Sunday, pushing Bitcoin below six figures for the first time since early May. Yet buyers stepped in quickly, snapping up coins and lifting the price back above $101,000 during the first hours of trading in Asia. That pattern shows how headline shocks can spark fast moves, but also how quickly sentiment can flip. Altcoins Take A Hit Meanwhile, over the past 12 hours, most altcoins fell about 1.4%, dragging total crypto market cap down by roughly $50 billion to $3.20 trillion, according to data. Experts expect that trend to reverse once major headlines calm down. Market analysts pointed out that altcoins might start to outperform if macro risks ease. They said smaller tokens are already showing signs of strength, even as Bitcoin stalls. Key Technical Levels Hold Traders are watching two key lines: the short-term realized price at $98,000 and the trend support at $102,000. The realized price reflects the average breakeven point for holders, so it often acts like a floor.

      "summary": "With Bitcoin precariously recovering above the $100,000 mark and altcoins bleeding momentum, traders are asking the obvious: Is the crypto bull run over? According to systematic trader Adam Bakay (@abetrade), the answer is not so clear-cut. In a detailed market breakdown posted June 22, Bakay offered a technically grounded, cautiously defensive assessment\u2014one that acknowledges geopolitical risks but stays rooted in positioning and price structure. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? \u201cLooking at the monthly and weekly timeframes, we are still technically in an uptrend,\u201d Bakay wrote, noting that \u201cno key swing low was broken, and the 365-day rolling VWAP has been respected during the pullback in April.\u201d Despite this, he admits that \u201cthe failure to make new all-time highs similar to the top in 2021\u201d is a concern\u2014especially given the accumulation by players like BlackRock, which now holds around 3.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply. It\u2019s that divergence\u2014between strong institutional interest and a market struggling to break higher\u2014that has made Bakay more cautious in recent weeks. \u201cThis is why I have been very defensive and kept most of my trades short-term,\u201d he said. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant His trading view focuses on two potential technical scenarios: either a reclaim of the $100,000 support area\u2014\u201clikely if the conflict in the Middle East does not further escalate\u201d\u2014or a dip into the $97,000\u2013$95,000 range, where strong technical support resides in the form of the 200-day moving average, local price structure, and the 90-day rolling VWAP. Still, Bakay made it clear he\u2019s not shorting the market. \u201cI am not currently considering any short trades due to my current positioning,\u201d he emphasized, adding that open interest is dropping and that we are starting to see the \u201cfirst signs of clear spot bid interest since the April lows.\u201d The options market, meanwhile, is flashing early caution: the 25-delta risk reversal skew sits around -5, not yet at panic levels, but trending more negative. Crypto Bull Run In Jeopardy On Ethereum, Bakay was notably blunt. \u201cETH almost had its moment, but of course had to become a disappointment,\u201d he said. He attributes the failed breakout in part to how quickly the \u201cDeFi Summer 2025\u201d narrative went viral. \u201cPeople are getting too horny, and market made sure to punish them,\u201d he noted, referencing his own tweet from a few days earlier. Related Reading: Crypto\u2019s Unlikely Ally: Top Analyst Reveals War As A Surprising Bullish Force The technical picture on ETH doesn\u2019t inspire confidence either. \u201cDuring significant market moves, like we had at the beginning of May, the last thing you want to see is price retracing throughout that area,\u201d he explained, saying the next meaningful support lies near $1,800. On the daily chart, Ethereum is sitting right at a confluence of support\u2014both the 90-day rolling VWAP and what he calls a \u201cpivotal level.\u201d Still, much like Bitcoin, Bakay sees Ethereum\u2019s short-term fate as largely dependent on developments in the Middle East. On positioning, ETH also shows signs of an oversold environment, though Bakay believes high volatility in ETH options has caused traders to use spreads instead of outright directional bets. \u201cPositioning is now very clearly pointing towards the possible upside reversal in both perpetual and spot,\u201d he said. Altcoins received no reprieve. \u201cAltcoins have not been having fun for quite a while,\u201d Bakay wrote, pointing out that \u201cevery time it starts to look better, it will almost immediately get worse.\u201d He notes that the expected rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins hasn\u2019t materialized, and the real rotation now seems to be into crypto-related equities, which better reflect the ETF-driven macro trade. Even strong names like Solana are fading. \u201cSOL has almost retraced the entire rally from April,\u201d he warned. The key level to watch is $100. \u201cThere is not much of a technical support sub-$100,\u201d and if \u201cshit hits the fan,\u201d Bakay would look to bid around that round number. Bakay also briefly touched on two newer altcoins\u2014Hype and Fartcoin\u2014saying one offers a solid product and the other draws interest through volatility and liquidity. \u201cFartcoin would become attractive if it could reclaim the $1 or $0.50 area. Hype could find a bounce sub-$30.\u201d His closing thoughts were pragmatic: \u201cWe are not in easy market conditions, with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and markets can be significantly affected by a single news release.\u201d While he believes the market may be \u201cgetting too short at the moment,\u201d he remains highly conscious of the possibility that a multi-month correction is already in play. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a need to be a hero and try to catch a falling knife,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI would much rather wait for some positive news and signs of lower timeframe reversals.\u201d In essence, Bakay doesn\u2019t call the top. But his post makes one thing clear: this is not a market for bravado. It\u2019s a time for restraint, tight risk management, and respect for volatility\u2014especially when the bullish case no longer has momentum on its side. At press time, BTC traded at $101,847.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-90000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price crash has been spurred on by looming war events as Iran and Israel continue to go head-to-head. Naturally, the financial markets have responded negatively to this news, and the crypto market has not been left out. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price had sat above the $100,000 psychological level for the longest. However, it was only a matter of time before it lost this support and crashed further, especially as the digital asset seems to only have major support in the 5-digit territory. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Master Ananda has revealed major bearish formations for the Bitcoin price. With the $100,000 support having held so far through the last week, it suggested there is still some buying going on for the cryptocurrency. However, the chart does not show enough strength to hold this level. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications Since the market has been rocked by over $1 billion in liquidations in the last week, it has transferred some weakness to the BTC price, putting the bears in charge once again. Pointing this out, Master Ananda explains that the weekly chart, in particular, is not showing any good signs. The current Bitcoin price action seems to only be a continuation of the bearish price action that began after it hit a peak of $111,900 back on May 19, 2025. Since then, the decline has been consistent, and the crypto analyst says the market looks \u201cterrible\u201d right now. Given the crash, the major support for Bitcoin is no longer above $100,000, but over 10% below it. As the price has previously broken below $100,000, the first support the market could see would be at $88,888. Failure to hold at this point would trigger another 5% decline toward $82,500 before bulls are able to put up any fight. What Happens If BTC Stays Above $100,000? While the bearish trend is the most dominant at this point, there is still the possibility that the Bitcoin price could stay back above $100,000 and hold the fort there. In this case, it is likely that the bullish trend would continue. The crypto analyst highlights this in another post, forecasting a very sharp upward move if this happens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again In the case of a recovery, then Bitcoin could retest the upper trendline that sits right above $108,000. And as for how long all of this could take to play out, the crypto analyst believes that the entire thing shouldn\u2019t take more than two weeks to actually unfold and pick a direction. \u201cDo not be afraid if the market shakes, Bitcoin is going up; Crypto will grow, regardless of the short-term,\u201d the analyst said in closing.
