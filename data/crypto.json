      "summary": "Solana has declined by around 13% in the past week, which has brought the asset back to a major on-chain support cluster. Could this be where the bleed ends? Solana Has Strong On-Chain Support Between $145 &#38; $147 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about where support and resistance levels lie for Solana based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend\u2014But Can They Keep It Up? The Cost Basis Distribution tells us about how much of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulating supply was last purchased or transferred at what spot price. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the data of the indicator for Solana over the past few months. As is visible, there are a few price zones near the current Solana spot price that stand out in terms of the amount of supply that they hold. The $155 to $157 range carries the cost basis of around 31 million tokens and the $164 to $166 range that of 29 million tokens. A third demand zone exists at $145 to $147, a region that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price is currently making a retest of. Here, the investors last purchased a total of 13 million SOL. To any investor, their cost basis is an important level, so they are more likely to show some kind of move when a retest of it occurs. Generally, this type of reaction isn&#8217;t anything relevant for the asset when just a few holders share their acquisition mark at the level, but when a large amount of them are involved, like in the case of the range that SOL is retesting right now, a sizeable reaction can sometimes appear. Generally, these moves tend toward buying when the retest occurs from above. That is, when the investors were in the green prior to the retest. This happens because these holders might believe the price decline to be just a dip opportunity or they may simply want to protect their cost basis. Similarly, holders might panic sell when the retest happens from below. This could happen because underwater sellers can be desperate to get back into the green and once they do, they might fear that the rise is only temporary so they could push for the exit. As Solana is retesting the $145 to $147 range from above, it&#8217;s possible that buyers from this region could provide support to the asset and help cushion its fall. In the event that a turnaround does happen, the $155 to $157 resistance range could be of focus next. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued? The analytics firm has also shared the CBD of another altcoin, Tron (TRX). As Glassnode explains, Cost Basis Distribution shows TRON found support in the $0.26\u2013$0.27 range, where over 14B $TRX is held -marking the strongest cluster on the chart. Above that, the supply is relatively thin and most investor positioning remains below current price. SOL Price Solana is currently hanging right at the lower end of the support range as its price is floating around $145.

      "summary": "Ethereum has struggled to maintain upward momentum following a brief rally that pushed its price above $2,800 last week. Currently, ETH is trading at $2,511, reflecting a 9.4% decline over the past week. This retreat comes amid a broader period of consolidation across the digital asset market, with Ethereum seeing both technical resistance levels and on-chain trends that could shape its price action in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching \u2013 Will History Repeat? Ethereum Faces Technical Resistance The latest analysis from \u0130brahim CO\u015eAR, a contributor to CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, highlights the significance of the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) as a resistance level for ETH. Historically, successful breakouts above this technical marker have been followed by substantial price gains. CO\u015eAR notes that in prior cycles, once ETH crossed above the 50-week EMA, price increases ranged from 25% to 135%. Averaging those moves suggests a breakout could see Ethereum targeting the $4,000 range. The EMA is a trend-following indicator that places more weight on recent price action, often used to identify potential breakout or breakdown zones in asset movements. Staking and Accumulation Metrics Show Investor Conviction In parallel to price action, Ethereum\u2019s staking metrics continue to show steady growth. On-chain analyst OnChainSchool reported that more than 500,000 ETH were staked in the first half of June, bringing the total staked to over 35 million ETH. This milestone represents the highest amount ever locked in Ethereum&#8217;s proof-of-stake contract and reflects a growing trend toward network participation and supply reduction. Staking, in ETH\u2019s case, involves locking ETH to help secure the network and validate transactions in return for staking rewards. As the amount of ETH staked rises, the liquid circulating supply shrinks, potentially tightening available supply on exchanges. Additionally, accumulation wallets, or addresses with no history of selling, have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH. Combined, these metrics point toward long-term holding behavior, rather than speculative trading. Ethereum Hits ATH in Staking: Over 35 Million ETH Locked \u201cAlongside this, Accumulation Addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH.\u201d \u2013 By @onchainschool Read more \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/WYoX9qpODZ pic.twitter.com/6MAlK0sCfJ \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 17, 2025 These on-chain developments coincide with ongoing interest in Ethereum-based financial products.

The stolen funds came from both the Tron network and various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. Massive Funds Drained From Hot Wallets According to ZachXBT\u2019s Telegram post, the first chunk\u2014$49 million\u2014went through a vanity address that read \u201cTKFuckiRGCTerrorists&#8230;mNX.\u201d A second custom address, \u201c0xffFFfFFffFF&#8230;Dead,\u201d was used to pull the rest. These special wallet names aren\u2019t random. They show how attackers slipped around Nobitex\u2019s checks and grabbed funds meant to stay locked down. Vanity Addresses Exploit Access Controls Experts say the use of these human\u2011readable addresses points to a flaw in the exchange\u2019s internal controls. \u201cAttackers managed to infiltrate systems that should have blocked unauthorized wallets,\u201d noted Hakan Unal of Cyvers security. The exchange confirmed that it spotted the breach quickly and suspended the affected hot wallets. Political Motive Behind The Breach A pro\u2011Israel hacker group calling itself \u201cGonjeshke Darande\u201d claimed responsibility in an X post.

This hack comes as tensions surged between Israel and Iran after Israel\u2019s largest strikes on Iran since the 1980s. Reports say at least 224 people died in Iran and 24 in Israel during the renewed conflict. Cold Storage And User Security Assurances Nobitex says users\u2019 main funds are safe in cold storage, and only a fraction of hot\u2011wallet assets were hit. The exchange promised to cover all losses with its insurance fund and internal resources. That promise should reassure customers, though the fear of leaked code or files could drive some to pull funds. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant Unmoved Funds Could Reveal Next Steps Interestingly, none of the stolen coins have moved since the hack was first spotted. That could mean the hackers are choosing their next move. Or it might be a warning shot meant to show they can strike again. Either way, this incident highlights how vital it is for exchanges to guard against insider\u2011level slip\u2011ups. Protocols alone aren\u2019t enough if people and processes leave doors open. As the crypto world watches, Nobitex users will be looking closely at how the platform rebuilds trust and keeps their money safe. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
