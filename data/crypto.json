      "summary": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the UK is all set to lift its ban on cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors. The FCA had banned ETNs in January 2021, citing their volatility and complexity for retail investors. However, because we\u2019re seeing increasing warmth towards cryptocurrency across the globe, the UK doesn\u2019t want to be left behind. Keep reading to find out more about the UK\u2019s decision regarding ETNs, how the US also has major pro-crypto legislation in the works, and what the best crypto to buy now is in light of these developments. UK &#38; UK Embrace Crypto For those unaware, an ETN is a debt security instrument offered by recognized entities. Its value is tied to an underlying asset, which, in the case of crypto, is a specific coin. As the price of the underlying asset goes up, the price of the ETN will also increase, and vice versa. It\u2019s worth noting that crypto ownership in the UK has increased from 18% in 2024 to 24% in 2025. This is more than that of the US. Naturally, a growth like this calls for a comprehensive regulatory design to regulate the ownership and use of digital assets in the country. Meanwhile, in the US, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is expected to go for a floor vote soon enough. The GENIUS Act aims to regulate various aspects of stablecoins, such as permitted issuers, transparency, consumer protection, federal and state-level oversight authority, and legal classification. All in all, a friendlier regulatory environment will lead to a more thriving crypto market. Bitcoin recently made an all-time high of $112K, and with positive and proactive legislative support, it might soon hit $150K, too. To hop on the crypto train and make the most of its momentum, consider investing in the following altcoins. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Best Crypto to Buy Now, the Fastest and Most Affordable Trading Bot Increased crypto adoption will directly impact the growth of meme coins, which is already among the most profitable niches of the crypto space. As a result, Snorter Token could see massive growth in the coming weeks. It&#8217;s a Telegram-native trading bot designed to snipe (buy) the best meme coins as soon as they&#8217;re launched using a contact address or pool ID. This way, it will help you outsmart the bots and whales circling like sharks in the crypto market. Snorter Bot is mighty secure, too. It&#8217;s got honeypot and rugpull detection, mint trap detection, real-time blacklist scans, and freeze alerts. Other useful features include copy-trading tools, portfolio tracking, and the lowest trading fees (just 0.85%) of all competitors if you hold $SNORT. You can become an early investor in this awesome meme coin with real utility by buying into its presale. The Snorter Token presale is fairly new but has still managed to raise over $575K. Each token is currently priced at just $0.0947. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will help you directly benefit from Bitcoin&#8217;s upcoming bull run, but at a fraction of the cost. It&#8217;ll do so in two ways: First, you&#8217;ll profit from a substantial increase in $BTCBULL&#8217;s price. According to our predictions, BTC Bull Token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 \u2013 a 3.7x jump from its current price of $0.00255. Second, you&#8217;ll benefit from BTC Bull Token&#8217;s free Bitcoin airdrops. A striking feature, the aforementioned $BTC airdrops will take place when Bitcoin reaches $150K and $200K for the very first time. However, only those who hold their $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events on social media will be eligible for free $BTC. Even better for $BTCBULL owners, the project will regularly shave off a part of the token supply. This will increase the crypto&#8217;s demand, which would then, in all likelihood, crank up its price. Buy BTC Bull Token now for just $0.00255 each. The project has emerged as one of the best crypto presales, with nearly $7M in early investor funding. 3. KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) \u2013 Viral New Meme Coin with Massive Potential KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) is a new meme coin that launched towards the end of May but has risen to become a force to reckon with in the entire crypto space. $KOKOK is up over 310% since its inception, including a chunky 28% gain over just the past seven days. This fascinating &#8216;disgusting&#8217; meme coin is proof that degens have enough love to share with other animals, too, besides cute dogs, cats, and frogs. &#8216;The King of the Drain Pipes&#8217; might be a fitting description for $KOKOK, but the fact remains that it could soon surge past its all-time high of around $0.20 and become one of the greatest meme coins of this year. It&#8217;s currently trading at $0.1724, with a market capitalization of $35M and a trading volume of $1.13M (up 110% over the past 24 hours). Increasing Crypto Adoption Notwithstanding, DYOR Is Necessary Despite the market&#8217;s increasing bullish outlook on the back of pro-crypto regulatory reforms, there&#8217;s no guaranteeing any returns on specific coins. The crypto market is highly unpredictable and volatile, so kindly do your own research before investing. Our articles are purely informational, not financial advice."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-consolidates-below-2800-bulls-need-this-level-to-trigger-next-leg-up/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is showing resilience amid the recent wave of market volatility and uncertainty. While the broader crypto market has pulled back over the past few weeks, ETH continues to hold firm above the $2,500 level \u2014 a key psychological and technical support zone. This strength has caught the attention of traders and analysts who see Ethereum\u2019s current price action as a potential launchpad for a move into higher territory. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart \u2013 Rally Ahead? Despite the retracement across major altcoins, Ethereum remains structurally intact, with bulls defending the lower boundary of its current range. The lack of panic-selling at these levels suggests growing confidence in ETH\u2019s long-term trajectory, even as macroeconomic pressures \u2014 including tighter liquidity and geopolitical uncertainty \u2014 continue to weigh on sentiment. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared a technical update highlighting that ETH is still trading within a well-defined range. According to his view, Ethereum\u2019s ability to consolidate without losing critical support is a sign of underlying strength. A breakout above the range high could trigger renewed momentum toward the $2,800\u2013$3,000 region, while a breakdown below $2,500 would invalidate the current setup. Ethereum Approaches Pivotal Zone Amid Uncertainty The crypto market has been navigating a volatile environment, and Ethereum is no exception. However, despite the turbulence, ETH has managed to maintain its footing above $2,500 \u2014 a key support level that continues to act as a buffer against deeper downside. With Bitcoin holding strong and altcoins preparing for potential breakout moves, the coming weeks could be decisive for Ethereum\u2019s next major trend. ETH currently trades 48% below its all-time high, but price action suggests that bulls are building momentum. Ethereum has absorbed recent volatility well, even as broader market sentiment remains shaken by rising geopolitical tensions, most notably, the growing conflict between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. While these headlines have added uncertainty, Ethereum\u2019s ability to stay range-bound reflects growing confidence among investors. Pillows notes that Ethereum is still trading within a well-defined range, and the structure remains intact. According to his analysis, reclaiming the $2,800 level would be a key breakout trigger, potentially opening the door for a fast rally to $4,000. Until then, ETH remains in consolidation mode \u2014 but with Bitcoin showing leadership and the market entering a pivotal phase, Ethereum could be on the verge of catching up. If bulls can maintain control and push through resistance, ETH could finally break out of its range and reenter a bullish price discovery phase. But if resistance holds, traders may see another leg of consolidation. Either way, Ethereum is entering a key window where market direction will likely be defined, and how ETH behaves around the $2,800 mark could determine the altcoin outlook for the rest of the summer. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop \u2013 Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Weekly Chart Shows Momentum Building Near Resistance Ethereum is holding steady near $2,500 as seen on the weekly chart, showing promising signs of strength despite recent market-wide volatility. After bouncing sharply from sub-$1,800 levels in May, ETH is now consolidating just below the $2,707 resistance \u2014 the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This level coincides with the upper boundary of the current range and remains the key line bulls need to reclaim to unlock further upside. ETH is currently trading above its 34-week EMA ($2,501) and the 200-week SMA ($2,450), both of which are acting as dynamic support. Holding these levels reinforces the idea that buyers are stepping in on dips, providing a strong base for potential continuation. However, the price is still capped by the 100-week SMA at $2,610, making the $2,700\u2013$2,800 region a critical resistance zone.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has faced renewed volatility since late May, with the market retracing from recent highs and injecting a fresh dose of uncertainty across the board. While price action has cooled, BTC continues to hold above key levels that bulls are watching closely. The broader sentiment remains fragile, and many investors are on edge, unsure if this is a healthy pause or a setup for deeper downside. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart \u2013 Rally Ahead? Analysts are calling for a decisive move above the all-time high to confirm trend continuation, but so far, momentum remains limited. The risk of a further decline still hangs over the market, especially with macro headwinds unresolved and liquidity tight. Top analyst Daan shared a timely technical update, highlighting that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have tested their respective 4-hour 200MA and EMA and bounced. These moving averages are closely watched for short-term trend shifts. The fact that both assets respected them as support could be a subtle but important signal. Still, this bounce needs follow-through. Without a strong push higher, traders may lose conviction, and the window for reclaiming bullish momentum could narrow quickly in the days ahead. Bitcoin Outperforms But Market Risks Loom Bitcoin continues to trade in a tight range just below its all-time high, struggling to break out with conviction but showing clear resilience. Despite repeated attempts from bears, BTC has held above the critical $100,000 psychological level \u2014 a key sign of strength as many altcoins lag behind or lose momentum. While some traders remain cautious, Bitcoin\u2019s relative outperformance is beginning to stand out, hinting at the possibility of a decisive move brewing beneath the surface. This strength, however, comes amid rising uncertainty in the broader macro environment. The US economy is entering a more fragile phase, with tightening credit conditions, stubborn inflation, and weakening labor data adding pressure. These developments raise the stakes for risk assets, including Bitcoin, which has historically thrived during expansionary periods but often struggles when liquidity tightens. Daan shared a critical technical update that could help map Bitcoin\u2019s short- and mid-term direction. According to his analysis, both BTC and ETH recently tested their respective 4-hour 200 moving averages (MA) and exponential moving averages (EMA), and successfully bounced from those levels. These indicators are often seen as key dynamic supports during trend formation. If price continues to hold above them, bulls remain in control. But if these levels give way, momentum could flip quickly, opening the door to deeper retracements. For now, the structure still favors the bulls, but the margin for error is shrinking. With Bitcoin holding steady while macro conditions wobble, the next move could set the tone for the rest of the summer. Traders and long-term holders alike should keep an eye on how BTC reacts to these key support zones in the coming days. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support After Pullback \u2013 Bulls Eye $3,000 Level Bulls Reclaim Key Levels Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after bouncing from the $103,600 support zone, as seen in the 4-hour chart. The recent drop to this level was met with strong buying interest, triggering a swift rebound. Price is now consolidating around $105,600, having reclaimed both the 200 EMA ($104,924) and the 200 SMA ($104,816), which had previously acted as dynamic resistance during the pullback. This reclaim is a notable technical development and suggests bulls are regaining short-term control. Volume spikes during the bounce add weight to the move, while shorter-term moving averages like the 34 EMA and 50 SMA are now sloping upward, further supporting the bullish case. Still, BTC must break decisively above $106,600 \u2014 a recent lower high \u2014 to confirm a shift in trend structure.

      "summary": "Bitcoin saw a sharp price dip on Thursday amidst a public fallout between US President Donald Trump and the world&#8217;s richest man Elon Musk. The premier cryptocurrency, which had traded steadily within the $104,000\u2013$106,000 range throughout the week, plunged to below $101,000 as tensions escalated between the two influential figures who attacked each other via their personally owned social media platforms i.e. X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social. Since then, Bitcoin has shown some market resilience climbing back to around $104,000. With another consolidation developing, market analyst Crypto Daan has highlighted the price levels that are critical to the next price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 \u2013 Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Beyond $106K Or Below $100K &#8211; What\u2019s Next For Bitcoin? The month of May proved largely bullish for Bitcoin as the digital asset surged from around $95,000 to establish a new all-time high near $112,000 marking the resumption of the larger crypto bull market. However, Bitcoin has noted a significant price correction since reaching this peak with market prices pegged around $104,000 on May 31. As seen in the first week of June, Bitcoin had hovered around $106,000 before its most recent price slump on Thursday. Due to this price action, Daan Crypto notes the digital asset is now trading within a price range of $100,000-$106,000, where it comfortably sits at the mid-range around $104,000. The analyst notes that if Bitcoin returns break below the lower range boundary at $100,000, the ongoing price correction could extend for 1-2 weeks. Going by BTC\u2019s stairwell ascent in the past month, potential market support in such a bearish case would lie around $95,000 and $85,000. On the other hand, if the market bulls can force a return above the monthly high of $106,000, Daan Crypto explains that such development would indicate the market correction is over, and Bitcoin may be headed for another price discovery with potential initial targets of around $120,000. Related Reading: XRP Wave Structure Predicts Wild Fluctuations On Its Way To $4 ATH BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,650 following a price gain of 2.98% in the past day. Using larger time frames , the premier cryptocurrency is up by 1.12% on its weekly chart and 7.49% on the monthly chart indicating a strong bullish control of the market. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart stands at 51.53 facing upward which supports the notion that Bitcoin\u2019s correction might be over with price eyeing a return to the overbought zone above 70. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency and fifth largest asset in the world. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview"

However, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin will ultimately dictate the move. Keeping a close eye on the intraday chart, the expert mentioned that an early pullback could present a scalp opportunity, as long as Bitcoin aligns with the bullish outlook. Breakout Likely With Strong Daily Candles Breaking down his latest analysis, the trader explained that LINK\u2019s daily candle officially closed bullish, marking a key technical point in the current trend. Meanwhile, LINKBTC ended the session on a positive note, which adds weight to the bullish outlook for LINK in the short term. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level \u2013 $10 Support Back In Focus However, the analyst emphasized that more bullish daily closes on LINKBTC are needed to confirm momentum. A continuation of strength could lead to an impulsive breakout above the daily candle\u2019s lower high trendline, igniting the next leg upward. A decisive move above the 0.000140 BTC resistance zone is expected to accelerate price action for LINK, giving bulls a clear signal to push higher. If momentum continues to build, LINK could rally toward the $16 resistance level, marking a major target for the current setup. For now, $12.50 remains a key support level on the daily timeframe and will act as a cushion if bearish pressure reemerges. Looking ahead, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Dominance will remain the primary market drivers for Chainlink heading into the weekend. While maintaining a rational outlook, CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor LINK\u2019s intraday chart closely for any developing setups. Awaiting Chainlink Next Trade Setup In conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD emphasized that LINK\u2019s intraday chart is showing signs of a bullish recovery, closely aligned with Bitcoin\u2019s recent rebound. He expressed optimism that further upside is likely if current conditions persist, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its strength. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support \u2013 Is A New Breakout Imminent? Despite the encouraging signs, CRYPTOWZRD noted that a temporary bearish pullback would be both natural and healthy within the current market context. Pullbacks often reset market conditions, providing better structure for stronger continuation patterns. He believes such a retracement could offer a favorable early entry point for long positions, especially for short-term or intraday traders looking to capitalize on the volatility. As the market continues to evolve, CRYPTOWZRD advises traders to wait for clear confirmation of the next trade setup before taking action. His statement emphasized that strategic patience will be key in identifying the most rewarding opportunities. For now, traders should track price behavior closely and prepare to act swiftly when the next valid entry signal presents itself. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"
