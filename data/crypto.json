      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-cbd-heatmap-marks-95500-97000-as-make-or-break-zone-details/",
      "summary": "Since hitting a new all-time high almost a month ago, Bitcoin has done little to assure investors of intent to explore new price territories. Amid announcement of new US trade tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, the premier cryptocurrency has come under bearish influences to trade as low as 101,000. At press time, Bitcoin is hovering near $104,000 following a 2.03% % decline in the past day. However, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted a crucial price range worth monitoring especially in the advent of a further price decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential $95,500\u2013$97,000: Bitcoin\u2019s Line In The Sand In a recent X post, Glassnode shares an insight into the Bitcoin market based on data from Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap. The CBD is a common on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last purchased or sold. When a substantial amount of coins are traded within a specific price range, it forms a supply cluster capable of acting as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode\u2019s report, the Bitcoin\u2019s CBD heatmap shows the first dense supply cluster below the current market price lies at $95,500 &#8211; $97,000 price zone. Interestingly, this range rests just below the short-term holders (STH) cost basis suggesting a confluence of technical and on-chain metric to present a high-stake battleground. Therefore, Glassnode analysts explain that holding the market price above this threshold reinforces bullish momentum and boosts Bitcoin chances of re-entering a price discovery mode. However, a breakdown below the $95,500 price level could trigger panic selling supporting bearish projections for the mid-term to short-term. Interestingly, prominent market analysts including anonymous X expert with username Mr. Wall Street has backed the latter scenario stating Bitcoin is due for a further price drops. Mr. Wall Street strictly warns Bitcoin would not hold above the $100,000 psychological support zone forecasting a price fall to around the $93,000 &#8211; $95,000 which Glassnode predicts should induce widescale market liquidations.

Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,753 with a cumulative 1.27% decline in the past week. During this period, the flagship cryptocurrency remained largely under $106,000 barring a weak price breakout between June 16 and June 17. On a monthly scale, Bitcoin has now recorded a 6.10% loss, signaling a gradual shift in momentum with bearish forces regaining control of the market. Meanwhile, with a market cap of $2.05 trillion, the &#8220;digital gold&#8221; continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency with a reported market dominance of 64.3%.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/chainlink-bears-push-to-12-50/",
      "summary": "According to an analysis posted on X by CRYPTOWZRD, Chainlink has closed the session with a bearish tone and is now testing the key $12.50 support level. With reduced weekend liquidity expected, price action is likely to remain choppy, making it essential to closely monitor intraday volatility. A clearer setup could take time to develop, but this zone may offer early clues about the token\u2019s next move. Oversold Pressure Builds: Is LINKBTC Ready To Rebound? In his expanded commentary, CRYPTOWZRD underscored that both the LINKUSDT and LINKBTC daily candles closed firmly bearish, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s broader pullback and highlighting the altcoin market\u2019s continued sensitivity to BTC\u2019s moves. He emphasized that this pattern underscores the need for healthier bullish candles to emerge before a sustainable recovery can take hold. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal Stands Firm, But Bitcoin Is Calling The Shots CRYPTOWZRD stated that LINKBTC sits in extremely oversold territory, suggesting that a positive reversal is statistically likely. Should a bounce materialize, he expects it to ignite a sharp upside spike in LINK, effectively flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish in short order. Turning to absolute price structure, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Chainlink is currently trading right at the $12.50 daily support target, a zone he considers pivotal. A decisive bullish reversal from this level, he argues, is essential to trigger an impulsive upside move and reestablish upward momentum. If buyers can reclaim control, CRYPTOWZRD identifies $16 as the next critical resistance, followed by a more substantial barrier at $19.50. Clearing these levels would signal that the tide has truly shifted, paving the way for a broader trend change rather than a short\u2011lived bounce. Despite this bullish roadmap, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin\u2019s weekend price action will remain a major influence on Chainlink, especially given the expected drop in liquidity. As a result, he plans to focus on lower\u2011time\u2011frame charts in the coming sessions, seeking quick scalp opportunities while waiting for clearer confirmation of direction. Chainlink Intraday Setup Builds Around $12.85 Decision Point Assessing the immediate outlook, the analyst notes that LINK\u2019s intraday chart remains bearish and noticeably volatile, underscoring the market\u2019s current uncertainty. Price action has been chopping around key levels, making any clear direction difficult to trust without firm confirmation. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support \u2013 Is A New Breakout Imminent? On the bullish side, the analyst points out that a decisive breakout and sustained hold above the $12.85 intraday resistance could flip sentiment. If buyers manage to establish support above this line, the setup would present a compelling long opportunity with an initial upside target near $14.40, where the next significant resistance resides. Conversely, the analyst warns that a failed attempt to hold $12.85\u2014marked by a retest and subsequent decline- would favor the bears. Such rejection would create potential short setups, as renewed selling pressure could drag the price lower, especially if broader market conditions stay cautious.

      "summary": "Crypto education and media platform Coin Bureau has shared some puzzling developments on the XRP market that may hint at a prolonged bearish future. Notably, the altcoin has been a major headliner amidst a general crypto market correction in the past one month. During this period, XRP prices have dipped by over 10% with current market prices around $2.13. While crypto enthusiasts remain hopeful of market resurgence, Coin Bureau\u2019s recent revelations shows that on-chain data suggests otherwise. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy XRP $3 Target Impossible Amid Declining Network Activity &#8211; Analyst According to an X post by Coin Bureau on June 20, XRP is facing an uphill task in regaining its bullish form due to network engagement crises. Notably, data from Glassnode shows that new wallets on the XRP Ledger have crashed from above 30,000 new addresses daily in January to presently below 5,000 new addresses daily. Interestingly, the chart by Glassnode presents a strong correlation between price action and network growth. The surge in wallet creation during late Q4 2024 was accompanied by a parabolic move in price that brought XRP to trade as high as $2.71. However, as the rate of new users entering the network began to decline, XRP\u2019s price action also entered a consolidation and gradual downward trend. &#160; Amidst other developments, Coin Bureau also highlights XRP&#8217;s daily active addresses has experienced a staggering drop from 557,000 to 34,000 to further suggest a lack of retail investor interest in the XRP ecosystem. According to the market analyst, the glaring fall in network engagement indicates XRP may lack sufficient market demand to support a bullish climb towards the $3 price region which is a crucial resistance zone. However, other analysts have presented an alternative theory. In particular, a market expert with X pseudonym MoonLambo explains the previous highs in network activity seen in Q4 2024 and January coincided with a period of widespread market greed following the US general elections. The analyst claims the decline is normal alongside social trends rather and is overemphasized by Coin Bureau.

Meanwhile, the asset\u2019s daily trading volume is up by 22.29% and valued at $2.25 billion. According to data from prediction site CoinCodex, XRP Investors still remain largely bearish but the Fear &#38; Greed Index stands neutral at 54. CoinCodex analysts are predicting XRP to remain in consolidation for the short term with predictions of $2.12 in one month. However, they forecast a steady long-term bullish revival with projections of $2.45 in three months and $3.03 in six months. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview"

      "summary": "Stablecoin backing is under fresh fire after outspoken economist and gold supporter Peter Schiff took aim at tokens tied to US dollar reserves. He argues that relying on a fiat currency he views as shaky makes little sense when a more stable asset exists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits\u2014Analyst Reveals Key Insight His comments have reignited a long\u2011running debate about what should sit behind digital coins that promise a steady peg. Schiff Questions Fiat Backing According to Schiff, it makes no sense to support a token pegged to a currency that can be inflated away. \u201cI get Bitcoin, but not US dollar stablecoins,\u201d he wrote in a social media post. He pointed out that fiat money can be printed in large amounts, while gold has a fixed supply and centuries of use as money. Schiff said gold cannot be easily devalued by inflation or reckless monetary policies. I get Bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins. If you&#8217;re going to introduce a third party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold? You get the same liquidity, but you also get a real store of value. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 19, 2025 Gold\u2011Backed Tokens On The Rise Based on reports, gold\u2011backed stablecoins are seeing more interest from investors worried about inflation and dollar weakness. Tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG) let users move digital claims on physical gold. These assets give the same quick transfers and high liquidity as dollar\u2011pegged coins but tie each token to real metal stored in vaults. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies Regulators across the globe are racing to establish precise regulations for stablecoin reserves. Congress members in the US are considering tighter reserve and audit requirements. Europe and Asia are creating their own regulations to achieve transparency and safeguard users. Schiff&#8217;s call for gold introduces additional context to these discussions. It could lead regulators to explore whether commodities can serve as backing for tokens under particular regimes. Market Reaction Mixed According to reports, Schiff&#8217;s tweet trended, garnering over 500,000 views within 24 hours. Crypto naysayers applauded his observation on fiat risk. Other investors cautioned that gold-backed tokens have higher fees and cumbersome custody expenses. They explained that transferring metal or establishing physical reserves introduces friction when compared with exchanging dollar-backed coins at a bank custodian. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free\u2014Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Investors also pointed out that stablecoins are widely used in lending, trading and payments within DeFi platforms. Dollar\u2011pegged tokens like USDC and USDT dominate these flows because they tie directly into existing banking rails. Gold\u2011backed coins, by contrast, tend to be held as digital bullion rather than spent on everyday transactions. Featured image Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-daily-rsi-trendline-breaks-down-what-it-means-for-price/",
      "summary": "After weeks of lower highs and higher lows, XRP\u2019s daily candlestick price chart is now giving a signal that could dictate the next major move. Although the token is still holding above key horizontal levels near $2.13, technical data suggests momentum is starting to slip. A technical analysis of XRP\u2019s daily RSI indicator offers a clue into what comes next, and it\u2019s not necessarily bullish in the short term. XRP RSI Breakdown: Loss Of Strength In Momentum According to an analysis posted by crypto chartist CasiTrades on the social media platform X, XRP\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just broken beneath a well-respected trendline that had been tracking higher lows since early April. The breakdown of this RSI structure, which is shown on the lower half of the chart below, is a strong shift in the short-term momentum dynamics for XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits\u2014Analyst Reveals Key Insight It shows that despite the XRP price holding relatively flat above the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $2.13, internal market strength has clearly weakened. The RSI had been forming a tightening wedge pattern for weeks, just like the price action\u2019s compression at the apex of a symmetrical triangle on the daily timeframe. This type of RSI trendline break typically signals a coming volatility expansion, and as the analyst warns, the release may come with a sharp sweep to major support before XRP reverses. It\u2019s a common occurrence for major price reversals to be preceded by a push into lower supports. In the case of XRP, crypto analyst CasiTrades highlighted some price targets to watch for reversals in case there&#8217;s a breakdown in XRP price. Support Levels At Risk: XRP Searching For Rebound Level XRP\u2019s price action is now entering an important test phase, one that could take its price lower before rebounding for the next major rally. Analysis from CasiTrades shows a few demand zones where buyers have stepped in. These demand zones are situated at $2.01, which aligns with the 1.236 Fibonacci extension, the $1.90 price level, and $1.55, which corresponds with the 0.618 retracement level from one of the recent rallies. These levels are filled with enough liquidity, and until XRP breaks and holds above $3, these supports will always be in play. If XRP hits one of these support levels cleanly and exhibits a sharp V-shaped recovery, that would signal the market found its pivot. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free\u2014Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says However, if XRP approaches these levels and stalls or bounces prematurely, that may lead to a final shakeout move, forming a deeper low before the real reversal begins. Either way, the RSI breakdown has now tilted short-term risk toward the downside, at least until price confirms a strong reclaim above $2.50 and $3. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.11, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Picjumbo, chart from TradingView"
