Crypto analyst Finsends has commented on this development and how it could affect the altcoin season moving forward. What\u2019s Next As Bitcoin Dominance Hits New High? In an X post, Finsends stated that the Bitcoin dominance has made a new high and that it feels like it can never go down again. However, he opined that there should be a bigger correction starting somewhere around the current levels. The analyst added that the potential target area for a top in this scenario goes up to 68.56%. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here\u2019s Why His accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin dominance could hit this projected top of 68.56% in July, after which a decline would begin. Based on the chart, the BTC.D could drop to as low as 48% on this decline, paving the way for a potential altcoin season. If so, then altcoins could witness significant gains in the second half of the year and outperform BTC in the process. In an X post, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe also commented on the rising Bitcoin dominance and a potential altcoin season. He noted that the altcoin season indicator has hit its lowest number in two years. The analyst added that the lows of this indicator over the last six years were in June or July. Based on this, he remarked that there seems to be a pattern since the indicator has hit a low again this June. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe didn\u2019t predict when exactly altcoin season could begin or if the Bitcoin dominance would top anytime soon. However, before now, he had expressed confidence that the alt season would still happen. The analyst noted that the last cycle was also called a Bitcoin cycle until altcoins started to run and heavily outperformed. What Needs To Happen For Altcoins To Take Off In another X post, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stated that altcoins are in need of an upward push from Ethereum, and that this needs to happen through a push of Bitcoin. He further remarked that once the BTC price bottoms out, that is a very likely moment for Ethereum to continue outperforming the flagship crypto, with the Bitcoin dominance declining. Related Reading: Analyst Calls Start Of Altcoin Season Amid Deviation Of Cyclical Lows \u2013 Details The analyst believes that altcoins would start \u201cshining\u201d when the next leg upwards for Ethereum takes place, possibly ushering in altcoin season.

However, for now, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes investors need to have some more patience.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Balance Sheet Swells to 11,111 BTC With the new purchase, Metaplanet\u2019s total stash now stands at 11,111 BTC, worth just over $1.07 billion. Its cost basis for those coins sits at about $95,869 each. Metaplanet\u2019s shares dipped 3.5% on the day of the announcement, a sign that investors may be worried about how the firm is funding its buy-ups. Source: Metaplanet Funding Through Bonds And Shares Based on reports, the company has raised cash via zero-coupon bonds and equity rights since January. It issued over 210 million shares under a program it calls the \u201c210 Million Plan.\u201d Evo Fund has snapped up many of those bonds and rights. Between May and June 2025, Metaplanet pulled in over $300 million, earmarking every dollar for more Bitcoin. Ambitious Target Of 210,000 BTC Metaplanet has set a goal to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That is 10 times its current pile. To reach that number, it will need to keep tapping the capital markets\u2014and it plans to. The firm even created a dedicated Bitcoin Treasury Operations arm in December 2024, moving away from its hotel management roots. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Dilution And Risk For Shareholders Metaplanet\u2019s fully diluted share count rose to close to 760 million as of June 23. That puts its Bitcoin per 1,000 shares at 0.0146 BTC. More bonds and shares mean more dilution for existing investors. If Bitcoin\u2019s price slips, the cost of raising money could climb, eating into any gains from the crypto itself. Metaplanet\u2019s approach mirrors what some other big holders have done. It\u2019s a bold stance. If Bitcoin holds up or heads higher, the firm could see big returns. But it will need to balance fresh capital raises against the risk of pushing down its own stock. For now, Metaplanet shows no sign of slowing down its Bitcoin buying. The only real question is how far this strategy can run before the bills come due.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-critical-support-2350-level-could-define-the-next-move/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has dropped 17% since Friday, breaking down from the long-standing range that held firm since early May. The sharp sell-off came after news broke of US airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, sending shockwaves across global markets and sparking panic selling in risk assets. ETH was no exception, plunging below multiple support zones before finding a temporary floor at $2,100. Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure \u2013 Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This level served as a critical demand area, and Ethereum has since managed to bounce, offering bulls a glimmer of hope in an otherwise uncertain market. However, the breakdown of the previous trading range indicates that momentum has clearly shifted in favor of the bears. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum must reclaim the top of the former range to signal that the downside move was a deviation rather than a full breakdown. As investors digest the growing geopolitical risk and continue to react to macroeconomic pressures such as persistent inflation and hawkish Federal Reserve policy, Ethereum\u2019s path forward remains uncertain. Still, the bounce from $2,100 provides a chance for bulls to reestablish control\u2014if they can push the price back above key resistance levels in the sessions ahead. Ethereum Holds Support But Bears Still in Control Recent price action has taken a heavy toll on altcoins, with Ethereum leading the downturn as most assets fall to lower demand levels. Since reaching its early June high, Ethereum has shed over 26% of its value, now trading under intense bearish pressure. Despite the decline, bulls have managed to defend the critical $2,100 support level, providing a temporary floor in an otherwise fragile environment. Geopolitical instability\u2014particularly the escalating conflict between the US, Israel, and Iran\u2014continues to add volatility and risk aversion to the market. Investors remain cautious, with the broader macroeconomic backdrop dominated by high US Treasury yields, stubborn inflation, and a hawkish Federal Reserve. These factors have put additional weight on the crypto sector, especially on Ethereum, which is widely seen as the main catalyst for a potential altseason that has yet to materialize. Ted Pillows notes that Ethereum recently tested the $2,100 support and successfully bounced. However, he emphasizes that the price must reclaim the top of its previous range to regain bullish momentum. If ETH fails to break and hold above the $2,350 range low, it risks a deeper move toward the start of the previous impulse leg\u2014or worse. The coming days will be critical for Ethereum. Reclaiming lost levels would indicate strength and possibly kick off the long-awaited altcoin rotation. But continued rejection could signal more downside ahead, with sentiment already fragile and demand still lacking. Until clarity returns, Ethereum remains in a decisive phase where every candle matters. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Chart Nears Tower Top Formation As US Launches Attack On Iran \u2013 Details ETH Price Analysis: Breakdown Below Key Structure Ethereum (ETH) has sharply declined, with the price now sitting around $2,248. This move marks a confirmed breakdown from the key range between $2,320 and $2,850, which had been holding since early May. The rejection from the upper resistance zone near $2,850, combined with high-volume selling, indicates clear bearish momentum. The current candle structure on the 3-day timeframe shows strong downward pressure, especially as ETH failed to hold above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (currently at $2,638 and $2,776, respectively). These levels now act as dynamic resistance, adding more weight against any short-term bullish reversal attempts. ETH is also trading well below the 50-day moving average at $2,265, a level that has historically acted as a short-term directional signal. Unless price reclaims and consolidates above that zone, the bearish trend could continue toward the $2,000\u2013$2,100 support cluster\u2014an area that previously sparked buying interest during March&#8217;s recovery. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates Volume has spiked significantly on this drop, suggesting panic selling rather than a controlled correction. For bulls to regain control, ETH must reclaim the range low at $2,320 quickly. Otherwise, downside pressure could continue to dominate in the near term.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-cycle-high-at-20-30/",
      "summary": "The XRP price could be preparing for a historical rally, as a prominent crypto analyst has boldly predicted that the cryptocurrency could reach a fresh cycle top between $20 and $30. The forecast, which presents a massive upside for the altcoin, is based on the Elliott Wave Theory\u2014a key technical analysis tool. XRP Wave Map Signals Cycle Top Ahead Crypto analyst, XForceGlobal on X (formerly Twitter) has presented a bold new forecast for XRP, projecting a cycle high between $20 and $30. The analyst shared a chart that dissects XRP\u2019s price action over the last several months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is currently in the final stages of a corrective wave before beginning a powerful multi-leg impulsive rally. If this wave count plays out as the market expert says, XRP could be on the verge of its most aggressive breakout to date. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $3.61 In Short Term As \u2018Cup\u2019 Turns Hot The analysis focuses on XRP\u2019s medium-term correction, which has taken the form of a complex WXY structure. According to the chart, XRP is nearing the completion of Wave 2, a corrective phase that began after the last upward impulse. XForceGlobal has pinpointed a key Fibonacci confluence zone between $1.60 and $1.90, where XRP\u2019s pullback is expected to find support. The chart clearly marks this area as a potential springboard for the next bullish phase, as long as the price does not fall below the $1.618 level, which serves as the invalidation point for the current setup. Despite XRP\u2019s historical track record of sluggish performance and ongoing skepticism within the crypto community about the bullish forecast, XForceGlobal maintains confidence that the cryptocurrency will reach the ambitious $20-$30 cycle top\u2014a move he believes could unfold well into 2026. Intermediate Targets First, Cycle High Later According to XForceGlobal\u2019s chart, once XRP completes its current corrective move, the analyst predicts that the first leg of this upcoming rally may take the cryptocurrency past the $5 mark in Wave 3, followed by a deeper Wave 4 pullback and a final thrust into Wave 5 toward $6 or more. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 While these targets represent an intermediate-term bullish setup, on a macro scale, the long-term wave map implies that the whole structure could later culminate in a parabolic cycle top rally that sends XRP between $20 and possibly even $30. This optimistic outlook gains further credibility, as the analyst notes that XRP\u2019s internal wave count for the flat scenario has taken longer to resolve than initially expected. Beyond technicals, XForceGlobal highlights that market psychology plays a central role in its bullish forecast. He notes that the XRP community has weathered regulatory battles, market crashes, and years of stagnation, most notably the US SEC lawsuit. This prolonged adversity has turned XRP holders into \u201cbattle-tested veterans\u201d who are largely immune to fear-driven selling. This resilience, according to the analyst, could be the key to the next bullish phase of XRP\u2019s price action. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Want to check on Bitcoin\u2019s latest price moves? Just pop over to CoinMarketCap and\u2026 enter your wallet info? On June 20, 2025, visitors to a number of major crypto sites, including CoinTelegraph and CoinMarketCap, were prompted to connect their crypto wallets before accessing the site. The pop-up was a hack, a wallet-stealer designed to siphon information away from users. CoinMarketCap users can create accounts and connect wallets to track their portfolios, so the pop-up itself might not have seemed entirely out-of-place. Users quickly uncovered the hack, and affected sites moved rapidly to limit the damage. The incident highlights a new potential vulnerability in the growing crypto ecosystem. With such attacks, phishing can occur even on trusted platforms. What Wallet? Hacks Exploited Common Wallet Connectivity Features The incident involved the injection of malicious JavaScript code into CoinMarketCap\u2019s homepage. When unsuspecting users visited the site, they were greeted with a realistic-looking \u2018Connect Wallet to Verify\u2019 popup, mimicking standard Web3 wallet connection prompts. Users who clicked the popup and approved the transaction gave attackers full access to their wallets. The CMC hack reportedly had 39 victims with over $18K in losses. The script was since removed, and CMC has patched the vulnerability. Cointelegraph Also Targeted Just days later, on June 23, Cointelegraph, another prominent crypto news outlet, faced a similar attack. In this case, attackers managed to compromise an ad-serving network, injecting code that produced a fake token airdrop popup promoting a nonexistent \u2018Cointelegraph token&#8217; or &#8216;CTG.&#8217; The popup redirected users to a phishing site designed to harvest wallet signatures. Once again, users who interacted and signed the transaction lost access to their funds. Cointelegraph quickly issued a warning across its social media channels and disabled the malicious script. Both the CMC and CT hacks are part of a growing category of crypto hacks focused on compromising wallets. Per CertiK\u2019s quarterly report, these attacks produce the largest losses (over $1.450M in Q1 2025 alone). Wallet compromises are not as successful as other attacks, ranking last by incident count. But when they work, hackers can make off with vast amounts quickly. Vigilance and Knowing the Warning Signs: Key to Avoid Losses Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) took to X and warned users to \u2018be careful when authorizing wallet connect.\u2019 Both the CMC and CT hacks used pop-ups, one for a simple wallet connect prompt, and one for a purported crypto airdrop. Cointelegraph&#8217;s official account also posted a warning, urging users to not click the pop-ups, connect wallets, or provide their personal information. Crypto airdrops and crypto presales are often used by legitimate projects to develop early interest and generate buzz about new projects, making such phishing attacks more convincing. Scammers create fakes in order to encourage investors to give away wallet information. The supposed project or token \u2013 in this case \u2018CTG\u2019 \u2013 never existed. How do investors stay safe? Avoiding any unexpected or unusual pop-ups, even from trust sources, is a first step. And when it comes to the crypto ICOs and presales, it&#8217;s important to get your info from trusted sources. This is where a new solution, Best Wallet, stands out. This new app is the only Web3 wallet with a presale directory where you can browse only audited, secure presale tokens. The wallet also employs Multi-Party Computation technology, protecting your key from phishing attacks and hacks. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 The World\u2019s First and Only Crypto Presale Wallet The evolution of crypto hacks is unfortunately part of crypto&#8217;s growing market and popularity. New Web3 solutions, like Best Wallet, are evolving to tackle these security challenges, becoming a critical part of the crypto economy. And the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is here to power-up the Best Wallet ecosystem and provide additional perks for holders. With $BEST, token holders can trade and swap tokens more easily, participate in community governance, and earn higher staking rewards. The token also allows early access to the best crypto presales, gathered and vetted by Best Wallet in their \u2018Upcoming Tokens\u2019 section. Here, investors can find upcoming crypto projects, as well as all the key information, such as whitepapers and tokenomics, needed to do research before investing.
