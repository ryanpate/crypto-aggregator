      "summary": "Dogecoin has observed a rebound from the support line of a Parallel Channel. Here&#8217;s where the next target could lie, according to an analyst. Dogecoin Found Support At Lower Level Of This Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the daily Dogecoin price is currently looking from the perspective of a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset&#8217;s price witnesses consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel tracks successive highs, and the lower one lows. Related Reading: This Altcoin Looks Like PEPE Before It Exploded, Analyst Says The cryptocurrency breaking out of either of these levels implies a continuation of the trend in that direction. A surge above the channel is a bullish signal, while a fall under it is a bearish one. There are three different types of Parallel Channels. The Ascending variation occurs when the trendlines are sloped upwards. That is, it represents a phase of consolidation to the upside. Similarly, the Descending type involves the asset going down with time. In the context of the current topic, the third and most common variant is of interest. This type signifies a phase of true sideways movement, with the channel being parallel to the time-axis. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-day price of Dogecoin has been moving inside for the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin daily price recently saw a brief retest of the lower level of the Parallel Channel. This line of the pattern is generally considered a level of support, and indeed, it played this role during the recent retest as well by helping the memecoin to turn around. DOGE has since been on the way up. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is now targeting the $0.19 level, situated at the midway point of the Parallel Channel. In the event that Dogecoin can clear this level, it&#8217;s possible that the coin may set its sights on the $0.26 mark next. This price corresponds to the upper level of the pattern, which provided resistance to the memecoin on a couple of occasions in May.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-liquid-staking-hits-new-ath-with-35-5-million-eth-locked-will-price-follow/",
      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) is up more than 8% over the past 48 hours, climbing from around $2,400 on July 1 to nearly $2,600 at the time of writing. The latest on-chain analysis reveals that both accumulation addresses and liquid staking volume are approaching all-time highs (ATH), fueling optimism that ETH\u2019s price may soon follow. Ethereum Liquid Staking, Accumulation Addresses Nearing Historic Highs According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Carmelo_Aleman, Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking activity has seen a notable increase since June 1. The total amount of ETH staked rose from 34.54 million to 35.52 million by June 30 &#8211; an increase of nearly one million ETH in just one month. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 \u2013 Here Are The Levels To Watch As of July 1, ETH set a new record in liquid staking, reaching 35.56 million ETH. A closer look suggests that most accumulation addresses are linked to institutional investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other large holders. Many of these investors choose to earn yield through liquid staking while waiting for substantial price appreciation. Among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend are decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like Lido and Binance Liquid Staking, known for their scale and investor-friendly features. In addition to the rise in liquid staking, ETH accumulation addresses are also nearing record highs. As shown in the following ETH Cohort Study chart, these addresses grew 35.97% &#8211; from 16.72 million on June 1 to 22.74 million by June 30. For the uninitiated, Ethereum accumulation addresses are wallets that acquire and hold ETH without significant outgoing transactions, often excluding known exchange, miner, or smart contract addresses. These addresses typically signal long-term investor confidence, as they represent entities accumulating ETH without actively selling. Also worth highlighting is that the Realized Price of these accumulation addresses &#8211; their average acquisition cost &#8211; stood at $2,114 on July 1. As ETH trades at $2,593 at the time of writing, these accumulation addresses are sitting on a healthy profit of approximately 22.65%. ETH Primed For A Breakout? Technical analysis suggests that ETH could be poised for a breakout in the near term. In a recent post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto pointed out that ETH appears ready to break out of a broadening wedge pattern on the weekly chart, with a potential upside target of $4,200. Related Reading: Ethereum In Demand: ETF Inflow Streak Extends To 7 Weeks Institutional interest in Ethereum also appears to be strengthening. Notably, ETH may have found its own \u201cMicroStrategy moment,\u201d with Tom Lee and Joe Lubin revealing plans to accumulate significant ETH positions. That said, ETH must maintain support above the $2,200 level. A breakdown below this threshold could open the door for a drop to as low as $1,160. At press time, ETH is trading at $2,593, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-surges-past-descending-resistance-bulls-target-97-10-level/",
      "summary": "Litecoin (LTC) is back in the spotlight as bullish momentum sweeps across the crypto market. After months of volatility and sideways action, Litecoin is showing signs of strength, pushing above key technical levels and attracting fresh investor interest. The broader market recovery, fueled by optimism in Bitcoin and Ethereum, has created favorable conditions for altcoins to regain traction, and Litecoin could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Related Reading: Tron DeFi Activity Expands: SunSwap Hits $3B+ Monthly Swaps In 2025 Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis highlighting a major development: Litecoin has broken above a key level on the daily chart. This breakout is a critical technical signal, suggesting a potential trend reversal after weeks of consolidation and indecision. While resistance remains overhead, analysts believe that a confirmed reclaim of this level as support could trigger an expansive phase for LTC, opening the door to strong upside moves. As institutional interest in crypto grows and macroeconomic conditions stabilize, assets like Litecoin\u2014known for speed, low fees, and high liquidity\u2014may attract attention from traders and investors seeking asymmetric returns. With momentum on its side and market sentiment shifting, the coming days will be crucial to determine whether Litecoin can turn this breakout into a full-scale rally. Litecoin Bullish Momentum And ETF Hopes Fuel Rally Litecoin (LTC) is gaining bullish traction as price action strengthens and investor sentiment improves across the crypto market. Currently trading above $90, Litecoin has broken out of its downward trend, signaling renewed buying interest and technical strength. This move is particularly significant, given months of sideways consolidation and the broader market\u2019s gradual recovery. According to Carl Runefelt, Litecoin has decisively broken above its descending resistance on the daily chart\u2014a bullish technical setup that could pave the way for further gains. Runefelt believes the next target is $97.10, a level that, if reached and held, could mark the start of a new upward leg for LTC. The recent breakout has reignited interest in Litecoin\u2019s medium-term prospects, especially as traders look for altcoins with momentum and untapped upside. Adding to the optimism is speculation surrounding a potential Litecoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). According to Bloomberg, the probability of approval for a Litecoin spot ETF by October 2 (local time) has risen to an impressive 95%. Such a product would offer institutional investors a new and regulated vehicle to gain exposure to LTC, potentially unlocking significant inflows. With favorable technicals and strong fundamentals aligning, Litecoin appears poised for a breakout. The coming days will be critical as bulls aim to confirm support above $90 and push toward the $97.10 resistance. If ETF approval expectations continue to build alongside broader market momentum, Litecoin could emerge as one of the top-performing altcoins of the current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounces Off Key Demand Level \u2013 Price Discovery On The Menu? LTC Price Action: Key Levels To Reclaim Litecoin (LTC) is showing strong bullish momentum after breaking above a key descending resistance level on the daily chart. As seen in the chart, LTC surged over 4% in the last session, closing at $91.23. This breakout follows weeks of tight consolidation near the $85 zone and signals growing interest as market sentiment improves across the board. Price has now moved decisively above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which have acted as resistance in recent weeks. The next challenge lies at the 200-day moving average, currently near $98.50, which aligns closely with the analyst-projected target of $97.10. Reclaiming that level would confirm a full trend reversal and open the door to testing the $100 psychological level. Related Reading: Tron Shows Adoption Strength As Volume Still Led By Big Transfers \u2013 Details Volume has also picked up, supporting the breakout and suggesting that buyers are stepping in. If bulls maintain momentum and consolidate above $90, Litecoin could confirm a shift in market structure and set the stage for a broader rally. On the downside, any rejection at the 200-day MA could trigger a retest of the $87\u2013$89 support area. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
