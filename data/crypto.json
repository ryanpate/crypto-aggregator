      "summary": "The Bitcoin price has recently climbed back above the $108,000 mark, yet it struggles to surpass its current record of $111,800, creating a sense of uncertainty in the market. This persistent inability to break through has characterized the cryptocurrency&#8217;s performance in recent weeks, leaving analysts to speculate on its next moves. Analyst Predicts Major Upswing Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the near term, offering insights into both immediate volatility and a long-term bullish outlook. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit emphasized the significance of the current market conditions, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 According to Doctor Profit, the market is poised for a breakout. He noted, \u201cWe\u2019re standing in front of a breakout, one that has the potential to send Bitcoin into the $120,000\u2013$150,000 zone over the next few months.\u201d This assertion is supported by data reflecting strong on-chain activity, favorable technical structures, liquidity flow, and macroeconomic factors. While the long-term outlook appears promising, he cautioned that short-term fluctuations will remain prevalent. Two Scenarios For The Bitcoin Price Doctor Profit outlined two primary outcomes that traders should consider. The first scenario involves a bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern, allowing Bitcoin to surge past the $113,000 resistance level and continue climbing without a pullback. However, the analyst views this scenario as overly simplistic, suggesting that market makers typically prefer not to allow such parabolic moves to occur without a preceding shakeout. The second scenario, which appears more likely, involves either a rejection at the bull flag breakout or a liquidity grab at the $113,000 mark. This would potentially lead Bitcoin to revisit the lower boundary of the current range, around $90,000 to $93,000. Doctor Profit noted that this region is attractive because it contains significant liquidity and a notable gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market. He views a dip to these levels not as a bearish signal, but rather as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. In his analysis, he stated, \u201c$93K is not bearish. It\u2019s clearly a gift!.\u201d Doctor Profit believes that this potential dip would not only reset market leverage but also shake out weaker hands, creating a more robust foundation for a subsequent rally. Macroeconomic Trends Favor BTC Looking at the long-term prospects, Doctor Profit highlighted that larger wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating that major investors are positioning themselves for a significant upward movement. He pointed to macroeconomic indicators, particularly the M2 money supply, which suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to broader economic trends. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Notably, the Bitcoin price has been trading within its current range for 226 days, which echoes patterns observed during previous accumulation phases before major price breakouts. As Doctor Profit concluded, the Bitcoin price trajectory remains optimistic, with expectations of reaching between $120,000 and $150,000 in the foreseeable future. He notes that while there are multiple paths to achieving this target, a dip into the $90,000 to $93,000 range would provide a crucial opportunity for accumulation and set the stage for a powerful upward move.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action has been relatively stable in recent days, currently trading just above $107,000 after briefly touching previous highs near $108,000. Amid this backdrop, technical analysis from a popular crypto analyst on the TradingView platform outlined a compelling structural setup forming on Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart. The analysis shows that Bitcoin&#8217;s action is in a compression phase that could precede a breakout to $115,000 very soon. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role Compression Structure Forming Below $108,000 Resistance Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is currently following movements in traditional risk assets like the S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq, both of which have recovered following the recent de-escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Against this backdrop, crypto analyst RLinda shared an outlook on TradingView that highlights a structural setup forming on the D1 chart and predicts a breakout to as high as $115,000 if some resistance levels are cleared. According to RLinda, Bitcoin is in the middle of a compression phase just below the $108,100 resistance level. This follows what the analyst describes as a false breakout above $100,000, which led to a brief distribution and now an active accumulation zone. The daily chart shows price action gradually tightening within the $106,500 to $108,100 range since June 25, the essence of which the analyst called a pause for a breather before a possible continuation of growth. The current setup has already established well-defined boundaries, with support at $106,500 and $108,100 as immediate resistance. A breakout above this immediate resistance would pave the way for the next resistance around $110,400 and bring Bitcoin within striking distance of its all-time high at $111,000. On the other hand, a short-term pullback toward $105,650 is still possible before a new move to the upside. Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is really pressing on this resistance level around $108,000 and is building momentum for a breakout once the price level gives way. The key resistance levels to monitor are stacked around $108,100, $108,900, and $110,400. As long as the structure between $106,500 and $108,100 holds, and Bitcoin&#8217;s price is sticky near the top of that zone, the breakout scenario becomes increasingly probable. Although there are currently no reasons for a decline on the daily and weekly candlestick charts, the analyst noted that a temporary pullback to $105,650 or even $104,650 cannot be ruled out. However, even such a pullback would likely only serve as a retest but still keep the broader setup intact.
