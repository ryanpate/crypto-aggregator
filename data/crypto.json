      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-set-for-liquidity-traps/",
      "summary": "A seasoned crypto analyst has warned that the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price action may be setting the stage for major liquidity traps, echoing patterns seen in past cycles. As the leading cryptocurrency aims for new all-time highs, the pundit suggests that market makers could be deliberately engineering conditions for bear traps before triggering a powerful breakout. Bitcoin Path To ATH Riddled With Liquidity Traps Crypto market expert Luca has shared intriguing insights into Bitcoin\u2019s latest price behavior, arguing that the market may be entering a classic liquidity trap phase allegedly orchestrated by market makers. The analyst stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin\u2019s price action since topping out in late May 2025 has followed a suspicious pattern. He noted that despite experiencing several price rallies, not a single local high has been swept in the past few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $110,000: Why BTC Must Break Out Of This Wedge Luca suggests that this rare price structure could be a deliberate setup, giving the illusion of stability and offering false conviction in bearish positions. The analyst warns that market makers have possibly influenced this market behavior by baiting shorts into entering or holding positions with the assumption that Bitcoin could continue to be capped below resistance. Ideally, this underpins the theory that bear traps are potentially being set as BTC gears up for its next bullish rally. Notably, multiple key resistance levels are now stacked tightly between $109,000 and $112,000, as highlighted on the analyst\u2019s 4-hour Bitcoin chart. While BTC has been consolidating just below these levels, forming what appears to be a potential base, Luca argues that this price behavior is not a coincidence. Rather than market weakness, he believes the subdued price action reflects a calculated effort by market makers to encourage bearish complacency. The pundit interprets the deliberate avoidance of liquidity above these resistance lines as a signal that deeper bear traps are possibly being laid. Luca has revealed that this setup could be laying the groundwork for a sudden short squeeze, potentially igniting a sharp move toward a new all-time high for Bitcoin. Analyst Says BTC 2024 Breakout Back In Play Adding historical context to his analysis, Luca compares the current market structure to a prolonged consolidation phase observed throughout 2024. On the second 8-hour chart, a clear trendline of resistance can be seen capping Bitcoin\u2019s upside for most of the previous year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Double Top Above $106,000: FVG Says A Large Crash Is Coming The chart shows that price action consistently failed to break above the descending barrier, with multiple attempts being rejected between March and October. Each rejection was marked by unswept highs\u2014similar to the current market setup and suggesting that shorts were systematically being protected. This compression finally resolved in November 2024, when Bitcoin erupted through the resistance and launched a parabolic move to new highs. That breakout was fueled by the exact mechanism Luca now believes is in motion. With historical patterns now resurfacing, the analyst maintains that Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing suppression and untouched highs are part of a blueprint that indicates a possible bullish move toward uncharted price territory.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/warning-signs-long-term-bitcoin-holders-take-profits-as-leverage-spikes/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin continues to maintain its upward trajectory following a minor correction, now trading at $107,251, reflecting a 2.3% increase over the past week. Although still trailing its May all-time high of $111,000 by around 4%, the asset\u2019s price action signals a notable return of momentum. The crypto market, led by Bitcoin, has seen renewed trading activity in recent weeks as investor sentiment oscillates between bullish optimism and profit-taking behavior. According to new on-chain data analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin may be approaching a critical phase that demands greater attention from market participants. Related Reading: $179,000 Or $79,000? Bitcoin Faces Critical Cycle Pivot, Says Analyst Open Interest Spikes Signal Potential Profit-Taking Zones In his analysis titled &#8220;Binance Open Interest Spikes and Long-Term Holder De-risking: Bitcoin is Approaching a Turning Point&#8221;, Taha highlights two developing trends: repeated spikes in open interest on Binance and a significant drawdown in long-term holders\u2019 exposure. Both indicators, he suggests, reflect changing market dynamics that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s short-term trajectory. One of the key observations from Taha\u2019s analysis is the behavior of Binance\u2019s 24-hour open interest (OI), which has exceeded 6% for the third time in two months. Historical patterns indicate that previous occurrences on May 26 and June 10 were followed by short-term price corrections or periods of consolidation. These spikes often indicate an increase in leveraged trading positions, which tend to precede short-term profit-taking as traders seek to lock in gains. This trend may suggest that Bitcoin is entering another phase of heightened volatility where rapid shifts in market sentiment could influence price direction. The presence of leveraged positions, particularly at elevated price levels, increases the likelihood of sudden liquidations or pullbacks. While this does not confirm an imminent reversal, it marks a zone where caution may be warranted, especially for short-term traders. Such spikes in open interest often act as precursors to more conservative positioning or brief market cooling periods. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Reduce Risk Exposure In addition to rising speculative activity, a separate trend tracked by Taha focuses on the behavior of long-term holders (LTHs). Data shows that the LTH Net Position Realized Cap, a measure of the realized value of Bitcoin held by these investors, has declined sharply, falling from over $57 billion to just $3.5 billion. This reduction points to active profit-taking among more strategic investors, possibly in response to macroeconomic developments or uncertainty surrounding the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align While this shift in behavior does not automatically imply a bearish outlook, it suggests that experienced investors are trimming exposure after a notable price rally. Historically, long-term holders have exhibited a higher degree of market foresight, making this activity worth noting. Combined with elevated open interest and a potential cooling-off period, these developments highlight the possibility of increased short-term volatility without fundamentally altering the long-term bullish structure of Bitcoin\u2019s market.

      "summary": "Bitcoin briefly pushed into the $108,800 level a few hours ago but was once again unable to reclaim higher prices, reinforcing the key resistance just below its all-time high. This rejection has left the market in a state of caution, with investors expecting increased volatility in the coming sessions. As BTC continues to hover below the $109,300 mark, traders are watching closely for signs of either a confirmed breakout or a potential pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles Below ATH After Weeks Of Failed Attempts \u2013 $109K Level In Focus Adding a new layer to the current setup, top analyst Ted Pillows shared a notable development in Bitcoin dominance. According to Pillows, the Bitcoin Dominance chart is now showing a daily bearish divergence\u2014a classic signal that often precedes a shift in momentum from Bitcoin to altcoins. This divergence occurs when BTC dominance trends higher while momentum indicators begin to weaken, suggesting that Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength may be peaking. For altcoin investors, this could be an early signal of a shift. Historically, bearish divergences in dominance have lead to strong altcoin rallies, as capital begins flowing from BTC into higher-beta assets. While Bitcoin consolidates near resistance, attention may soon shift toward altcoins, setting the stage for a possible altseason. Bitcoin Consolidates As Charts Signal Altcoin Rotation Following the resolution of global tensions between the US, Israel, and Iran, Bitcoin surged above the $105,000 level, signaling renewed confidence across global risk markets. The move marked a key recovery from previous uncertainty, with BTC taking back critical support and shifting focus back toward the $110,000 resistance zone. However, despite the initial breakout, Bitcoin has struggled to push into uncharted territory. Price action remains choppy and directionless, with the market hesitating ahead of what many believe could be a decisive move. Analysts continue to call for a breakout, citing strong accumulation trends, improving macroeconomic conditions, and a bullish long-term structure. Yet the inability to break above the $109,300\u2013$110,000 range raises concerns about weakening momentum. The longer Bitcoin remains capped below resistance, the more likely it is that capital may begin to rotate into other parts of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared key insights supporting that thesis. According to Pillows, Bitcoin dominance is showing a daily bearish divergence\u2014a classic sign of impending trend reversal. As BTC dominance climbs but momentum weakens, it suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s recent strength may be fading, and a shift toward altcoins could be underway. Historically, bearish divergences in BTC dominance have often preceded sharp corrections in Bitcoin and explosive rallies across the altcoin market. As Bitcoin consolidates and its dominance loses strength, conditions may be forming for the next big altseason. While nothing is guaranteed, the combination of geopolitical relief, market indecision, and technical signals suggests that a sharp rotation could be close. Traders are now watching both BTC price and dominance levels closely, knowing that once momentum shifts, the move could be swift and powerful. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $269M In Net Inflows In 24H \u2013 Bullish Momentum Accelerates ETH/BTC Chart Shows Signs Of Reversal The ETH/BTC weekly chart reveals a prolonged downtrend that has persisted since late 2022, with Ethereum consistently underperforming against Bitcoin. Since peaking above 0.085 BTC in late 2022, the pair has steadily declined, now trading around 0.0228 BTC\u2014a level not seen since 2020. This confirms that Bitcoin has been the clear market leader for nearly two years, adding most of the capital inflow during bullish phases while altcoins, including Ethereum, lagged behind. However, current price action shows early signs that this trend may be nearing its end. ETH/BTC appears to have found a local bottom, just above the 0.02 BTC zone, after a steep drop. Although the pair remains well below the 50 (weekly), 100, and 200 moving averages, the selling momentum has clearly slowed, and volume has begun to stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel \u2013 Next Move Could Be Parabolic This phase suggests that a swing could be forming. If Ethereum can reclaim higher support levels and Bitcoin dominance continues to show bearish divergence\u2014as noted in recent market analyses\u2014the ETH/BTC ratio could start trending higher once again. A rotation from Bitcoin into Ethereum and other altcoins may soon follow, potentially marking the beginning of a new phase in the crypto cycle where altcoins start to outperform.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards has provided an update on the current Bitcoin price action, predicting that the flagship crypto could reach as high $145,000 later this year. The analyst alluded to a doji pattern, which supports this bullish prediction. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally To $145,000 In an X post, Stockmoney Lizards stated that his mid-term target for the Bitcoin price is between $135,000 and $145,000. He expects BTC to reach these targets between September and October later this year. The analyst also touched on the current price action and why he believes the flagship crypto will reach such lofty heights. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place Stockmoney noted that the Bitcoin price is trading at the upper level of the corrective channel, forming some dojis at this level. He admitted that he doesn\u2019t know how many bounces market participants will see from BTC and what levels the crypto will test. He raised the possibility that the local bottom may be in and also that BTC could retest the $90,000 to $94,000 range. The analyst stated that if he had to bet, he would probably predict that the Bitcoin price taps the high of the $90,000 range again. BTC had dropped to as low as $98,000 last week amid the escalated tensions between Israel and Iran. Bitcoin has since recovered following the ceasefire between both countries. Stockmoney affirmed that the latest Bitcoin price action is a bullish formation as the flagship crypto has had an impulsive move up. He added that the current price action is not the usual money rotation with old traders selling and new traders loading up at range lows. The analyst also indicated that BTC\u2019s rally isn\u2019t driven by the derivatives market either. BTC To At Least Reach $135,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has echoed Stockmoney\u2019s prediction that the Bitcoin price could at least reach $135,000. In an X post, the analyst declared that BTC\u2019s path to this price target remains intact. He stated that Bitcoin is now challenging the first Fibonacci extension at $107,000 after breaking out and retesting key levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Once the Bitcoin price clears this Fibonacci extension, Titan of Crypto believes that the next stop is $135,000.

His accompanying chart showed that BTC could reach this Fibonacci extension at $135,000 by September, aligning with Stockmoney\u2019s prediction. The chart also suggested that BTC could still rally to as high as $150,000 at some point. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,200, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-after-2-07-fib-zone-test/",
      "summary": "XRP showed a powerful technical reaction after dipping precisely to the $2.07 Fib confluence zone, where multiple key levels aligned \u2014 including the golden .618 Fib retracement and wave-based extensions. The sharp bounce from this area signals a potential end to the recent correction and opens the door for further upside. The Perfect Bounce: XRP Finds Bottom At $2.07 Confluence CasiTrades, in a latest post on X, stated that on Friday, XRP dipped precisely to the $2.07 confluence zone, aligning with the golden .618 retracement, the 1:1 extension for wave C, and the .618 extension for subwave 5. She noted that a sharp reaction from that level would confirm the correction bottom, and the market did exactly that, snapping upward from the $2.07 mark. Related Reading: XRP Price Springs Higher \u2014 Rally Reignited with Bullish Momentum Since then, momentum has steadily increased, with bullish pressure building over time. Price action is now pressing into a critical resistance zone at $2.25, a level that represents the macro .382 Fibonacci retracement and has served as a significant technical barrier for months. Breaking and holding above this level could signal a shift from recovery to full-blown bullish continuation. Adding to the momentum, Ripple dropped its appeal, and the US SEC\u2019s withdrawal could be the next trigger to price spikes. According to CasiTrades, the legal finish line is finally in sight, just as the price completes its correction structure, a timing she believes is no coincidence. This, she emphasized, is why technical analysis matters: it allows traders to identify key setups before the news breaks, positioning ahead of market-moving headlines. Key Short-Term Scenarios To Watch The analyst further explained that from this point, she is closely watching two key short-term scenarios unfold. In the first scenario, XRP makes a move up to around $2.30, followed by a pullback to retest $2.25 \u2014 this time as support, which CasiTrades considers an ideal and healthy move. Related Reading: XRP Silent Accumulation: A Falling Wedge On The Verge Of Explosion The second scenario involves a stronger push straight through to the $2.45 zone, heading toward the larger resistance near $2.69. In this case, a minor pullback would likely occur just before the price interacts with the $2.69 resistance area. After that, the analyst anticipates a backtest of the $2.25 level. Either way, she emphasized that $2.25 remains the critical level to watch. Successfully flipping it sets the stage for a much larger breakout move. CasiTrades added that Friday\u2019s bounce wasn\u2019t just a random spike; it was a precise reaction to a completed structure. With wave 2 down, wave 3 is officially underway, and once these nearby resistance levels are cleared, it could all lead to a surge. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
