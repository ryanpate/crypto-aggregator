      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-4-years-rise-to-149000/",
      "summary": "According to a new analysis shared by crypto analyst Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d Severino, Bitcoin has just closed the quarterly chart with a perfected TD9 sell setup. This is actually interesting, because it adds a possibly long timeline before Bitcoin can reach any further significant price target. Most of Bitcoin&#8217;s daily candles in the past seven days have shown mild upward pressure supported by positive sentiment from various technical analyses. However, according to the TD9 setup, Bitcoin could take up to four years to reach $149,000. TD9 Setup Hints At Slow Climb To $149,000 The TD9 is a component of the TD Sequential indicator, which is often used to identify trend exhaustion, potential reversals, and possible trend changes. Interestingly, what makes this particular signal notable at this point is that it is now projecting a TD Risk level of $149,490, which is essentially a price target for Bitcoin. But if past patterns on the TD9 indicator are anything to go by, getting there might take much longer than bulls expect. Related Reading: Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement In 2017, a similar perfected TD9 appeared during Bitcoin\u2019s first rally to $20,000. At the time, the TD Risk was projected at $35,000. It wasn\u2019t until late 2020, roughly four years later, that Bitcoin finally reached and broke above that level. A prior occurrence in 2014 offered the same story. Back then in 2014, the TD9 setup projected a TD Risk of $2,400, but it took approximately 3.5 years to cross that threshold. Now, despite the bullish sentiment today, this historical precedent suggests it could take similar years before the $149,490 target being currently projected by the TD Risk is finally tested or breached. The 3-month candlestick price chart shown above provides a visual analysis of this projection. From the 2014 cycle low, it took 915 days across 10 quarterly candles for Bitcoin to reach its next high. After the 2017 signal, it took 1,096 days (or 12 quarterly candlesticks) for BTC to finally surpass the projected TD Risk level. Bitcoin Price Action On Gradual Climb Bitcoin has spent the past seven days in a steady but modest uptrend, rising approximately 1.5% from a weekly low around $105,430 to the current range between $109,240 and $109,600. During this move, Bitcoin&#8217;s price action tested and retested resistance in the $108,200 to $108,800 zone several times in the past 24 hours. However, it ultimately pushed higher, showing a slow but stable bullish undertone. Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 \u2014 Details At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,330, up by 2% in the past 24 hours. It is currently about a 36% move away from reaching the $149,490 price target. However, if Tony Severino&#8217;s timeline on the TD9 Risk setup does play out, it wouldn&#8217;t be until sometime around July 2029 before Bitcoin reaches the $149,490 price target.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-detonate-shorty-target/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin was changing hands near $0.174 in European trading on Thursday, extending a two-day rebound that began when buyers twice defended the mid-June floor around $0.16. The 11% recovery since the Tuesday low has put the largest memecoin back on traders\u2019 radars, but technical analyst More Crypto Online cautions that what looks like an impulsive burst is in fact \u201call corrective in nature,\u201d with the market still trapped inside a complex diagonal wave pattern that could just as easily fail. Dogecoin Is Quietly Coiling For A Potential Breakout In a video update recorded on 2 June, the analyst dissected the one-hour chart and concluded that the advance from the 22 June low is best counted as a three-wave move. \u201cBecause wave 1 \u2026 was only a three-wave move, the third wave should unfold as an ABC structure,\u201d he said, underscoring that the rally lacks the five-wave DNA of a trend reversal. Even so, as long as Dogecoin defends what he called a \u201cmicro-support area between $0.16 and $0.166,\u201d the diagonal remains valid and a measured target at $0.196\u2014the 138 percent Fibonacci extension of wave 1\u2014\u201cremains plausible.\u201d The roadmap is conditional. First, the current A-wave has to finish; then a corrective B-wave should follow, \u201cand in the C-wave we could then rally to round about $0.196.\u201d A probe toward $0.182 before that pullback cannot be ruled out, but the analyst warned viewers not to assume a straight shot higher. \u201cPlease be aware that we could be dealing with very choppy and messy structures,\u201d he said. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under $0.20 \u2018Is Free,\u2019 Says Analyst\u2014Predicts 2,000% Upside If bulls do force a full five-wave climb from the July swing low, that sequence would mark the first leg of a larger five-wave advance\u2014a textbook signal that the broader down-trend from Dogecoin\u2019s March peak may finally be exhausted. Failure to hold $0.16, however, would invalidate the diagonal count and expose the June lows near $0.151, where on-chain data show a thin layer of spot bids and little derivative support. Market context is mixed. CoinGecko data show Dogecoin\u2019s 24-hour turnover has topped $1.5 billion, roughly in line with last week\u2019s average, while the memecoin\u2019s correlation with Bitcoin has weakened to 0.62, its lowest reading since early May. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit In the short term, though, all eyes are on the $0.16 band. As More Crypto Online summed up, \u201cThe diagonal pattern basically remains plausible as long as we\u2019re holding that $0.16 level.\u201d Should that floor survive the inevitable B-wave turbulence, Dogecoin\u2019s \u201cquiet setup\u201d might indeed detonate shortly\u2014propelling the token toward $0.196 and potentially signalling a more durable trend change. Notably, the upper boundary of Dogecoin\u2019s long-running descending channel in the daily chart, now situated near $0.20, lines up almost exactly with More Crypto Online\u2019s bullish target. A decisive breakout through this confluence would not only pierce the ceiling that has capped prices since the December 8 high at $0.4843 but could also validate the analyst\u2019s call for a trend reversal. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.174. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Crypto Inside has provided a bullish outlook for the PEPE meme coin. The analyst predicted that it could witness a 150% surge as it looks to grab the liquidity above its current range. PEPE Eyes Rally To $0.000025 In Bid To Grab Liquidity Above In a TradingView post, Crypto Inside shared an accompanying chart in which he predicted that PEPE could jump to as high as $0.000025 following its reclaim of the $0.000010 support zone. He explained that this price surge could occur because there is currently more liquidity above than below. Related Reading: PEPE Eyes 500% Move In Pre-Breakout Retest, Can It Outperform Dogecoin? The chart showed that there is a total sell liquidity of 10,678.659 trillion around this $0.00025 range. Meanwhile, the total buy liquidity for PEPE below its current crucial support zone is 6,827.768 trillion. It is worth mentioning that a rally to $0.000025 will bring the meme coin close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00002825. Crypto Inside touched on the meme coin\u2019s liquidity depth. The analyst stated that the price moves from one liquidity to another and that this is the meme coin\u2019s fuel. He remarked that there is significantly more of this fuel accumulated at the top, alluding to the sell liquidity. The analyst added that PEPE has always been a highly speculative asset, and during prolonged one-sided movements, extremely high funding is formed in it. This, he noted, provokes sharp jumps in price. Crypto Inside also commented on the current PEPE price action. He noted that the meme coin has now reached the largest zone of interest at $00.0000817 and is trying to consolidate there. He remarked that this is a powerful level around which consolidation can be expected before further growth. However, he warned that if the PEPE price falls below it without the possibility of returning, it will be an extremely bearish signal. The Meme Coin\u2019s Narrative Is Still Strong As part of his analysis, Crypto Inside suggested that PEPE\u2019s narrative is still strong, which is why the meme coin still has a chance to reach new highs. He explained that the narrative itself is still important in meme coins and that PEPE is an \u201ceternal meme,\u201d which will live forever. He added that it is the embodiment of meme culture in the world. Related Reading: PEPE Price Confirms Phoenix Rising Pattern That Triggers 70% Surge The analyst assured market participants that there is no need to fear PEPE\u2019s oblivion. He declared that it will definitely not die as a narrative and that there is nothing to worry about. However, he admitted that new meme coins like Fartcoin have stretched liquidity across the market, and many have left PEPE for \u201cnew shiny things.\u201d At the time of writing, the PEPE price is trading at around $0.00001056, over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/the-silent-bitcoin-accumulation-public-companies-surprising-h1-2025-lead/",
      "summary": "According to recent data, public companies have raced ahead of Bitcoin spot ETF issuers by snapping up more than twice as much BTC in the first half of 2025. Public firms added 245,510 BTC to their balance sheets from January through June, a 375% jump over the 51,653 BTC they bought in the same stretch last year. At the same time, spot ETF issuers purchased 118,424 BTC, leaving them well behind their corporate counterparts. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Near Pain Point Last Seen In October 2024 Public Firm Purchases Smash ETF Buys According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, the 245,510 BTC bought by public companies during H1 2025 is more than four times the 118,424 BTC ETF issuers gathered. That ETF component is 56% lower than the 267,878 BTC they purchased in H1 2024, despite the funds experiencing more robust inflows than they experienced towards the end of 2024. The difference indicates increasingly companies are holding Bitcoin directly instead of relying on exchange\u2011traded products. More Companies Join Bitcoin Rush Data shows 254 entities now hold Bitcoin, and 141 of those are public companies. That marks big growth from the start of the year, when only 67 firms had BTC, and the end of March, when the number hit 79. Those counts translate to a 140% rise in six months and a nearly 80% gain in three months, underlining how many new players have jumped in. Strategy\u2019s Share Of Acquisition Dips Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) still leads corporate buyers, but its slice of the total has shrunk. In H1 2024, Strategy\u2019s purchase of 37,190 BTC made up 72% of all corporate buys. In the first half of 2025, the Michael Saylor\u2011led company purchased 135,600 BTC but now accounts for 55% of the total\u2014down from its previous dominance. Firms such as Metaplanet, GameStop and ProCap have stepped into the spotlight, each adding large sums to their Bitcoin holdings. Supply Shock Could Be Coming According to industry commentary, the increase in corporate purchasing in addition to continuing ETF demand could take a bite out of available supply. When the next halving event reduces new Bitcoin issuance, less will flow into the market. Analysts caution that increasing institutional interest and declining supply might produce a significant price response.

If that trend continues and reward for miners decreases following the halving, the battle for Bitcoin&#8217;s scarce supply could get fiercer.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/buy-bitcoin-before-jackson-hole-arthur-hayes/",
      "summary": "Arthur Hayes has published a new essay, \u201cQuid Pro Stablecoin,\u201d arguing that the United States\u2019 sudden political enthusiasm for bank-issued stablecoins is less about \u201cfinancial freedom\u201d and more about arming the Treasury with a multi-trillion-dollar \u201cliquidity bazooka.\u201d The former BitMEX chief\u2014writing in his personal newsletter\u2014contends that investors who postpone buying Bitcoin until the Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing will serve as \u201cexit liquidity\u201d for those who bought earlier. How The Money Printer Is Already Warming Up At the core of Hayes\u2019 thesis is the claim that eight \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d banks hold roughly $6.8 trillion in demand and time deposits that can be transformed into on-chain dollars. Once customers migrate from legacy accounts to bank stablecoins\u2014he cites JPMorgan\u2019s forthcoming \u201cJPMD\u201d token as the template\u2014those deposits become collateral that can be recycled into Treasury bills. \u201cAdoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power,\u201d he writes, adding that the product simultaneously slashes compliance overhead because \u201can AI agent trained on the corpus of relevant compliance regulations can perfectly ensure that certain transactions are never approved.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Hayes layers a second mechanism on top of the stablecoin flow. If Congress strips the Federal Reserve of its ability to pay interest on reserve balances\u2014a proposal floated by Senator Ted Cruz\u2014banks would have to replace that lost income by buying short-dated Treasuries. He estimates the policy could \u201cliberate another $3.3 trillion of inert reserves,\u201d bringing the prospective fire-power for government debt purchases to $10.1 trillion. \u201cThis $10.1 trillion liquidity injection will act upon risky assets in the same way Bad Gurl Yellen\u2019s $2.5 trillion injection did\u2026 PUMP UP THE JAM!\u201d Hayes asserts. The essay frames the bipartisan GENIUS Act as the legislative linchpin. By barring non-banks from issuing interest-bearing stablecoins, Washington \u201chands the stablecoin market to banks,\u201d ensuring that fintech issuers such as Circle cannot compete at scale and that deposit flight is funneled into the institutions most likely to bankroll the Treasury. Hayes calculates that the cost savings and enhanced net-interest margins could increase the combined market capitalisation of the big banks by more than 180 percent, a trade he describes as \u201cnon-consensus\u201d but executable \u201cin SIZE.\u201d Buy Bitcoin Before The Fed Blinks Despite his long-term enthusiasm, Hayes cautions that a temporary liquidity drain looms once Congress passes what he labels Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill.\u201d Refilling the Treasury General Account to its $850 billion target could contract dollar liquidity by nearly half a trillion dollars, an impulse he believes may knock Bitcoin back toward the mid-$90,000s and keep prices range-bound until the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole conference in late August. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases \u201cI believe that between now and the August Jackson Hole Fed speech to be given by beta cuck towel bitch boy Jerome Powell, the market will trade sideways to slightly lower. If the TGA refill proves to be dollar liquidity negative, then the downside is $90,000 to $95,000. If the refill proves to be a nothingburger, Bitcoin will chop in the $100,000s without a decisive break above the $112,000 all-time-high,\u201d Hayes writes. The punchline, however, is resolutely bullish. Hayes ridicules advisers steering clients into bonds on the premise that yields will fall: \u201cIf you\u2019re still waiting for Powell to whisper \u2018QE infinity\u2019 in your ear before you go risk-on, congrats \u2014 you\u2019re the exit liquidity. Instead go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.\u201d In his view, the political machinery that props up US deficits has already selected bank stablecoins as the next round of stealth quantitative easing, and Bitcoin\u2014alongside JPMorgan stock\u2014is positioned to absorb the spill-over.
