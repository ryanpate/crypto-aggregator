His outlook came as Congress moved to set new rules on how these tokens must be backed.

He called that view \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d It would mean backing up to $2 trillion in tokens with US Treasury Bills. Based on reports, Citigroup analysts think issuers might buy an extra $1 trillion in those bills by 2030.

The amendment won cloture yesterday. That clears the way for a final vote, likely early next week. Supporters say the change will boost confidence by ensuring every dollar-linked token has real backing. Market Size Today Right now, the total stablecoin market sits at about $255 billion. Dollar-pegged coins make up roughly $233 billion of that. That equals 90% of the whole market. The top nine dollar-pegged coins include USDT, USDC, USDe, DAI, USD1, FDUSD, PYUSD, TUSD, and USDD. They account for nearly all stablecoin activity. Challenges Ahead Regulators have work to do. If the GENIUS Act stalls or changes, issuers might head to friendlier markets. There\u2019s also a risk that a handful of big players could dominate. That could create new \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d worries if a major issuer faces trouble. Plus, tech glitches and smart-contract bugs could still trigger runs on tokens.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-price-crashes-below-103000/",
      "summary": "After hitting $110,450 on Monday, the Bitcoin price is writing its third consecutive red day as the benchmark cryptocurrency fell 5.3% from an intra-day top of $108,450 to a trough of $102,664 before clawing back to about $104,456 by press time. The sell-off coincided, almost minute-for-minute, with confirmation that Israel had conducted large-scale air-strikes on Iranian nuclear installations, sending ripples through every major asset class. Why Is Bitcoin Going Down Today? Israel\u2019s pre-dawn operation \u2014 its first overt attack on Iranian territory since the October-2024 raids \u2014 instantly repriced global risk. Oil futures jumped more than 10%, spot gold printed a fresh record high above $3,400 an ounce, and US equity futures slid roughly 1.5%. Bitcoin\u2019s draw-down resembled its initial reaction to Iran\u2019s failed missile barrage on Israel in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside \u201cOil up. Gold up. Bitcoin down,\u201d Anthony Pompliano wrote on X, noting that the pattern echoes April\u2019s missile incident, after which \u201cBitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours.\u201d Bitcoin educator Peter Duan argued in a separate post that \u201ca dip in Bitcoin happens every time there is serious geopolitical [turmoil] \u2026 In the long run, this will only push more people to Bitcoin,\u201d pointing to the 24/7 nature of crypto trading versus the still-closed equity cash markets. Macro strategist Joe Consorti drilled down on the mechanics: \u201cBitcoin, S&#38;P and NDX are all being panic-sold. Crude oil, natural gas, gold and US Treasuries are all spiking higher. The flight to safety trade is here.\u201d A fresh surge in crude is precisely what US policymakers did not need. West Texas Intermediate vaulted past $77 a barrel\u2014its first visit to that level in four months\u2014after Israel struck Iranian nuclear facilities, erasing much of the hard-won disinflation dividend and dragging energy back to centre stage. The contract is now more than $21 above its April trough, threatening to unwind the benign price trends that had been taking hold. This comes after US inflation data once again surprised to the upside this week. May\u2019s Consumer Price Index rose just 0.1% on the month and 2.4% year-over-year, while core CPI matched that modest 0.1% gain and held at 2.8% on an annual basis. Producer prices told a similar tale on Thursday, with the headline PPI up only 0.1% month-over-month and 2.6% on the year, both below consensus expectations.

If energy continues to climb, markets will anticipate a rebound in headline inflation and the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to postpone the rate-cut cycle traders had pencilled in for September. Bitcoin, which is acutely sensitive to fluctuations in global liquidity, often underperforms when the policy outlook tilts toward tighter financial conditions\u2014explaining its abrupt slide alongside the spike in crude. The newsflow triggered one of the heaviest forced-liquidation washes of 2025.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/coinbase-shopify-best-wallet-fiat-card-payments/",
      "summary": "Crypto exchange Coinbase announced that it will launch its Coinbase One Card later this fall. To be offered in partnership with American Express, the card will provide up to 4% Bitcoin cashback, and zero trading fees (with a spread for the first $500 traded per month), among other goodies. According to the Coinbase One Card website, you can sign up for early access, and you&#8217;ll be notified when they start receiving applications. There are also no foreign transaction fees, and you can repay your balance using your linked bank account or crypto on Coinbase. Given the current context of increased current adoption, payment solutions like these are becoming the norm. And This puts Best Wallet\u2019s planned Best Card in a great position to capitalize on the growing demand for crypto cards used in real-world transactions. Shopify to Start Accepting $USDC Payments Meanwhile, eCommerce platform Shopify teamed up with Coinbase and Stripe to allow shoppers to pay with the $USDC stablecoin. This option will become available in 34 countries in the coming weeks. This will be a boon to Shopify merchants as well, as they will be able to receive stablecoin payments in their preferred local currency directly in their bank accounts. Big Tech to Adopt Crypto Too Shopify isn\u2019t the only tech company eyeing greater crypto adoption. Big names in the industry like Google, Meta, and Apple are also in talks with crypto firms about stablecoin integration. When these discussions finally come to fruition, we expect more and more people to adopt crypto. Imagine average folk using digital currencies to pay for their next iPhone, buy an app in the Google Play Store, or purchase a Facebook ad\u2014that&#8217;s the kind of future we may have soon. And trailblazing that future is Best Wallet with its upcoming Best Card for crypto payments. With the Best Wallet Token presale supercharging the entire ecosystem with lower fees, this non-custodial wallet will more than likely become a central hub for new adopters. Best Card: Best Wallet\u2019s Answer to the Growing Crypto Payment Cards Market Aside from Coinbase and Shopify, Best Wallet is also determined to grab its slice of the crypto payment pizza pie by offering real-world convenience through its Best Card. With it, you can use crypto to pay for basic amenities like your morning coffee or your next shopping spree. While Best Card isn&#8217;t live yet, the Best Wallet ecosystem is already feature-rich. The non-custodial crypto wallet lets you buy buy, sell, and swap coins, and even access the best crypto presales via its Token Launchpad. And the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) takes that to an entirely new level. For one, you\u2019ll enjoy lower transaction fees across the ecosystem, get higher staking rewards, and vote on key decisions on Best Wallet. The $BEST token is available at the official Best Wallet presale page. It\u2019s currently priced at $0.025175, but with a price increase happening in less than two days, it\u2019s best that you act as quickly as possible. Our Best Wallet Token buying guide has all the details you need to grab the tokens. You can also stake your tokens for a 105% APY, giving you a source of passive income. The staking APY may still change as more investors lock in their tokens in the pool, though. HODLing $BEST tokens may also be a good idea if you\u2019re banking on the project&#8217;s appreciation in a few years. According to our Best Wallet Token price prediction, $BEST could grow to $0.07 in 2030, or a 211% increase from its initial presale price. Easy Crypto Payments are Coming to a Store Near You With the growing crypto adoption staring everyone in the face, the emergence of crypto payment solutions like Best Card or Coinbase&#8217;s One Card is expected. It\u2019s only a matter of time before regular folks start storing crypto and using these cards for everyday purchases. In this sense, Best Wallet\u2019s Best Card is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend, especially if you hold its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST). With lower fees and exclusive access to presales (alongside benefits for the coming Best Card), it&#8217;s the perfect starting point for any crypto newcomer. But if you\u2019re considering buying crypto, always ensure that you do your own research. Remember that the crypto market is highly volatile, so only invest money that you can afford to lose."

      "title": "Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bears-back-in-control/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price has suffered a violent rejection after hitting the $110,000 level, showing a clear intention of the bears to keep the digital asset from hitting new all-time highs. So far, the rejections from $110,000 have been swift and have put the bears back in control. This has given credence to calls that the Bitcoin price will fall back below the psychological level of $100,000, something that could trigger another wave of declines in the crypto market. Bitcoin Rejection At $110,000 Part Of The Plan? The Bitcoin price rejection has no doubt triggered a wave of panic among investors, many of whom believe that this is the end of the cycle. However, a crypto analyst has suggested that the pullback is part of the larger plan as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap moves on its way to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 In the analysis, they explain that the digital asset is currently at a point where it is undergoing significant distribution, and this will explain the decline in price. The pullback in and of itself is no cause for alarm, as minor corrections after major surges are normal. In addition to this, there is a lot of accumulation going on as Bitcoin moves from the hands of old investors into the hands of new investors at a higher cost basis. The accumulation is expected to move Bitcoin into the next bullish wave. This bullish wave is the next step in the trend as the BTC price moves into place for the next price surge. Once the volume moves upward as expected, then the asset\u2019s price is expected to follow in succession. BTC Price Could Hit $130,000 Target After Breakout Going by the analyst\u2019s chart shared on the TradingView website, the Bitcoin price correction is not expected to last for long. Mainly, holding the $107,000 support becomes paramount at this level as this could set the launchpad point for the next bullish impulse. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The completion of the accumulation phase puts the next breakout level as high as $130,000, which would be an over 20% increase from the current level. However, this may not be the end as the crypto analyst has set a swing target for as high as $150,000. As for the timeline for when this could happen, the crypto analyst places a long-term target for the end of the year 2025. But there is also the possibility that the trend would be completed sooner and the Bitcoin price could reach its target and new all-time highs before the year runs out.

      "summary": "Despite failing to break out of its downtrend, ONDO could be preparing for a surge above the $2 barrier. Some analysts suggest it could repeat its 2024 playbook if it continues to hold its current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim \u2013 \u2018Up Only\u2019 Ahead? ONDO Breakout Eyes $2 ONDO, the native token of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance, is attempting to reclaim a key area amid the market pullback. Notably, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold the $1 mark since losing the area as support over three months ago. In December, the RWA token hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.14 after US President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), purchased 134,216 ONDO tokens for 250,000 USDC. This propelled ONDO\u2019s price above the $2 barrier for the first time, but the late 2024 and Q1 2025 corrections halted its bullish momentum, sending its price to the $0.60-$0.70 range. Following the late April market recovery, ONDO\u2019s price reclaimed the $0.85 area and broke out of its multi-month downtrend. The cryptocurrency then hovered between the $0.85-$1.10 levels throughout May, hitting a three-month high of $1.13 nearly a month ago. Since then, the token has been in a one-month downtrend, dipping below its local range after the recent market pullback. However, the cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim this range for the past week, hitting a one-week high of $0.92 on Wednesday. Crypto analyst World of Charts highlighted the token\u2019s performance, affirming, \u201cafter a long correction, Finally Looking Good For Midterm.\u201d As ONDO attempts to reclaim the $0.90 area, the analyst anticipates that the cryptocurrency will soon break out of its current range and the downtrend line, forecasting a 130% rally toward the $2 barrier. 2024 ATH Repeat Coming? On Thursday, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted ONDO\u2019s performance over the past year, asserting, \u201cNot sure there are many other charts looking as good on high time frames like ONDO.\u201d He explained that \u201cThe King of RWA\u201d is \u201cbasically holding a bullish structure since its launch,\u201d making a series of higher lows for over a year while maintaining its ascending support trendline. Meanwhile, analyst Alex Clay suggested that ONDO could see a parabolic run based on its performance in 2024. The market watcher noted that the token is currently accumulating at the bottom of a 15-month ascending channel, which previously served as a crucial bounce point for its rally toward its ATH. As Clay explained, after reaching the channel\u2019s upper boundary last year, ONDO saw a multi-month downtrend toward the lower boundary, before printing a higher low. This was followed by a massive rally toward the channel\u2019s top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback This year, ONDO is \u201cfollowing the Bullish Fractal from the previous year\u201d after falling to the channel\u2019s lower boundary, breaking out of the downtrend line, and registering a higher low. \u201cThese 2 reasons are more than enough to pump straight up to the channel&#8217;s top,\u201d the analyst concluded. If history repeats, the cryptocurrency could surge toward the $2.8-$3 area. At the time of writing, ONDO trades at $0.84, a 5.2% decline in the daily timeframe.
