      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/shiba-inu-burn-explodes-3194-can-it-change-the-shib-price-trajectory/",
      "summary": "Shiba Inu has seen a surge in burn activity, with the burn rate climbing by 3,194% in the last 24 hours. According to data from burn tracker Shibburn, over 521.6 million SHIB tokens were permanently removed from circulation during this period. This sudden and sharp rise in burn rate has raised optimism within the SHIB community, although the token&#8217;s price action is struggling with bullish sentiment. Large Transactions Dominate SHIB Burn Activity As shown by data from Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn tracking website Shibburn.com, the latest burn wave was dominated by a few large transactions. A notable contributor was the wallet address beginning with &#8220;0xdb6,&#8221; which alone facilitated burns totaling over 500 million SHIB across multiple transactions to the BA-1 burn address. One of its largest single burns reached 310,744,788 SHIB, followed closely by another 107,333,061 SHIB, and then another 103,276,575 SHIB. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin \u2013 Details Other wallets also participated, including &#8220;0x28be&#8221; and &#8220;0x6176,&#8221; with each sending SHIB tokens into various burn addresses such as CA and BA-2. These contributions, although not on the same scale as the primary whale wallet, collectively helped elevate the day\u2019s total burn count to over 521 million SHIB. Together, these burn events reflect a push within the Shiba Inu community to increase SHIB burns, which had otherwise been short of noteworthy burns in recent weeks. Despite Burn Efforts, SHIB Supply Still Faces Uphill Battle Although 521 million SHIB tokens is a significant figure for a single day, it barely makes a dent in the meme token\u2019s vast circulating supply, which currently sits above 589 trillion SHIB tokens. This context relays the challenge faced by the current Shiba Inu tokenomics. Despite periods of aggressive burns like the one witnessed in the past 24 hours, the token\u2019s massive supply continues to weigh on its long-term price appreciation goals. However, the spike in burn rate is still a positive signal, particularly from a sentiment standpoint, especially now that the Shiba Inu price is struggling with sentiment. With SHIB currently trading within a tight range between $0.00001225 and $0.0000119, more Shib burns in the rest of the new week could bode well for its price action moving forward. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001192, down by 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Despite the massive uptick in burn activity, market response is somewhat muted. However, there may be more happening behind the scenes. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump\u2019s World Liberty Connection A Shiba Inu community member recently posted on the social media platform X, hinting that the project\u2019s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, still has \u201cseveral aces up his sleeve\u201d for the Shiba Inu community. Although no further details were shared, past developments like the launch of Shibarium have influenced price trends. Hopefully, any new announcements could reignite interest and drive the Shiba Inu price token to new highs. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
