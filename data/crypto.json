      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bears-washed-out-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s narrow price movement over the past week contradicts a much different development in the futures market. According to Axel Adler Jr., an analyst at on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, a sharp rise in the long liquidation dominance metric could set the stage for a significant shift in sentiment that may completely wash out bears from the market. Adler shared the data in a recent post on X, accompanied by a chart showing previous points that resemble the current setup. Long Liquidation Spike Without Price Crash The dominance of long liquidations has jumped from 0% to +10% over the past seven days, a move that typically shows distress among bullish traders. However, what makes the current development especially noteworthy is the absence of a steep crash in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Instead, in the just concluded week, Bitcoin held mostly within the $103,000 to $106,000 range until a recent drop, despite facing increasing pressure from long-side liquidations. Related Reading: XRP Daily RSI Trendline Breaks Down \u2013 What It Means For Price Axel Adler Jr. explained that this sustained liquidation of long positions without a full-blown price collapse indicates sustained buyer support. According to data from CryptoQuant, BTC\u2019s long liquidations hit 2,200 BTC, the highest in the past week. Usually, a surge in long liquidations suggests that traders who were anticipating a price rally are being pushed out of their positions under pressure. The CryptoQuant chart below shows how spikes in long liquidation dominance, especially in the 15% to 20% range, have always preceded bullish reversals. According to the analyst, if this metric rises by another 5\u20137%, it could cause a high-probability scenario where bearish positions are washed out and flip Bitcoin\u2019s price movements in favor of the bulls. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Large Wallets Accumulate As Retail Exits Data from Santiment, another on-chain analytics platform, shows an interesting dynamic playing out among Bitcoin holders. Over the past ten days, wallets holding over 10 BTC have increased by 231 addresses, which is a 0.15% rise. Meanwhile, smaller retail wallets containing between 0.001 and 10 BTC have dropped by 37,465 in the same timeframe. This trend highlights a divergence in sentiment between large and retail holders. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break? According to Santiment, the shift where whales and sharks accumulate while retail exits is a bullish combination for Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s market value is hovering just below $104,000 during this accumulation phase, and there could be an eventual upward breakout once retail holders begin to reenter. Image From X: Santiment Despite the underlying on-chain strength, Bitcoin\u2019s spot price has taken a short-term hit in the past 48 hours. During this timeframe, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has slipped below support levels between $106,000 and $103,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,670, down by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. The decline can be largely attributed to recent U.S. strikes on Iran. The U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (June 21-22) caused immediate risk aversion across markets. Bitcoin fell 3.2% after announcements of the strikes, much like its 6% drop during similar 2020 Iran tensions. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-hit-9-days-inflow-streak-despite-price/",
      "summary": "The spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been in good form over the past few weeks, receiving renewed interest from investors in the United States. This recent spurt of momentum has been a rare bright spark in the crypto market, which has been overwhelmed with investor uncertainty lately. Interestingly, the typically straight line between the spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 performance and the BTC price action has not been particularly straight in the past few weeks. While the crypto-linked financial products have shone in the past few days, the underlying premier cryptocurrency has seen better days. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $1 Billion In The Past Week According to the latest market data, the US-based spot Bitcoin ETF market recorded a total net inflow of $6.37 million on Friday, June 20. This performance marked the ninth successive day of positive capital influx for the crypto investment products, signaling increased investor interest and demand. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets SoSoValue data shows that BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) was the only BTC exchange-traded fund with net inflow on Friday. The trillion-dollar asset manager\u2019s fund added a remarkable $46.91 million in value to close the week, as it continues to lead the pack in net assets. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was the only other Bitcoin ETF that recorded any activity on Friday. According to market data, the second-largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund by net assets posted a daily net outflow of $40.55 million on the day. Nonetheless, the $6.37 million single-day performance pushed the US-based Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 weekly record above the $1 billion mark. While this figure falls short of the exchange-traded funds\u2019 performance ($1.39 billion) in the previous week, it still represents a trend in the right direction after enduring two weeks of nearly $300 million in outflows. Bitcoin Price Falls Below $101,000 Level Despite the positive performances of the US-based Bitcoin ETFs, BTC\u2019s price has continued to struggle to build any sustained bullish momentum over the past two weeks. The flagship cryptocurrency seemed set for another trip to a new all-time-high price earlier this week before succumbing to some bearish pressure mid-week. In the late hours of Saturday, the price of BTC fell to below the $101,500 level as another wave of downward pressure hit the crypto market. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $101,484, reflecting an almost 2% price decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin is down by nearly 4% in the past seven days.

      "summary": "Solana has broken down decisively, losing a critical support level following news that the United States launched an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. The unexpected geopolitical development triggered widespread panic across financial markets, with altcoins taking the hardest hit. Solana, in particular, has seen significant selling pressure, dropping 20% from its May high of approximately $185 and now trading near $148. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move This breakdown confirms investor concerns that SOL&#8217;s uptrend has weakened. Top analyst Carl Runefelt noted that Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern\u2014a bearish technical structure often signaling deeper downside. The price has broken below the neckline of this pattern, confirming the potential for continued declines in the short term. Adding to the bearish outlook is Solana&#8217;s inability to reclaim its prior support levels during brief bounces. With momentum indicators turning negative and broader market sentiment rattled, the likelihood of a swift recovery appears slim unless macro conditions stabilize. Solana Faces Deeper Correction As Bearish Pattern Unfolds Solana\u2019s bullish momentum from late 2024 has all but faded, replaced by stagnation and sharp corrections as market conditions worsen. Now trading more than 50% below its all-time high, SOL continues to struggle under the weight of global macroeconomic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions. The US military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities has only added to the volatility, sending shockwaves through both traditional and crypto markets. While Solana was one of the strongest performers during the previous cycle, its price action has turned decisively bearish in recent weeks. Bulls have failed to maintain critical support levels, and the asset has now broken below its short-term trend structures. According to Runefelt, Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern, a classic technical signal that often precedes a prolonged downtrend. The pattern\u2019s neckline has been breached, and the projected bearish target now stands around $106.30\u2014a level not seen since February. The breakdown also reflects broader weakness in the altcoin market. Despite earlier hopes for an altseason, capital has rotated out of risk assets, favoring Bitcoin and stablecoins amid uncertainty. Solana&#8217;s inability to reclaim prior highs or establish higher lows points to a market in retreat. Momentum indicators continue to flash red, and unless bulls reclaim lost ground quickly, SOL could be facing an extended period of consolidation or further losses. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates SOL Price Analysis: Breaking Below Key Support Solana is under pressure as it breaks below the critical 200-day simple moving average (SMA) around $149.54, a level that had previously acted as dynamic support. This breakdown signals growing bearish sentiment as price action confirms a loss of momentum following weeks of consolidation below the $155\u2013$160 resistance zone. As of now, SOL is trading at approximately $135.99, down nearly 3% on the day and over 20% from its May highs. The chart shows a rejection near the 100-day SMA (green line), and the sustained move below both the 200-day and 50-day SMAs (blue line) points to a shifting structure, leaning heavily toward the downside. Volume remains elevated on red candles, confirming that the breakdown is supported by increasing sell pressure rather than a low-liquidity move. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason If the current trend continues, Solana could revisit the $120\u2013$125 range, which previously served as strong support in early Q1 2025. The broader context of macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tension, particularly the recent U.S. attack on Iran, adds to investor unease across risk assets, including altcoins like Solana. A daily close back above $149 would be needed to neutralize the short-term bearish structure and shift sentiment. Until then, downside risks dominate.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-slips-beneath-102000-heres-the-next-support/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price had a tough start to the weekend, plummeting from its $106,000 high to just above $103,000 on Friday, June 20. The flagship cryptocurrency became somewhat stable above this price zone, hovering around the $104,000 mark for most of the past day. However, the Bitcoin price faced another wave of bearish pressure in the late hours of Saturday, June 21, falling to around $101,500 as a result. Below is an analysis of the BTC price and what lies ahead for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Next BTC Support Level Lies At $100,000: Analyst Popular crypto analyst with the pseudonym Titan of Crypto put forward an interesting analysis for the Bitcoin price as the market leader struggles to build any momentum. According to the online pundit, the price of BTC could be on its way to retest a crucial support area if it continues to lose its bullish impetus. Related Reading: Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Enters Deep Red On Binance \u2014 What\u2019s Next For BTC Price? Using the Bitcoin price chart on the weekly timeframe, the next significant support level lies around the $99,000 \u2013 $100,000 range. The confluence of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) and the rising Tenkan-sen (red line) around this price region makes the zone a significant area to watch if selling pressure persists. The Tenkan-sen, a key component of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, is often considered a significant line in analyzing short-term trends. The Tenkan-sen line is often seen as a key support and resistance level, as well as a signal line for potential trend reversals. The Fair Value Gap is a liquidity void often created by a sharp movement in price, indicating a lack of trading activity within a particular price range. FVGs are usually considered as potential regions of interest for future price corrections, as investors often look to fill the liquidity void. With the FVG and the Tenkan-sen set within this same region, Titan of Crypto noted that the Bitcoin price may find a support cushion around the $100,000. This level appears to be extremely crucial for the flagship cryptocurrency in the short term, especially as its bullish momentum wanes. Meanwhile, holding above this $100,000 support could be critical to Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trajectory. It is worth noting that the price of BTC has not traded beneath $100,000 since May 8, reaching the $110,000 mark twice within that span. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After falling to around $101,400 in the late hours of Saturday, the price of Bitcoin has now returned around $103,000. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $102,845, reflecting a 0.4% decline in the past 24 hours.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-weekly-chart-nears-tower-top-formation-as-us-launches-attack-on-iran-details/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has officially broken below the long-standing range it had maintained since early May, losing the critical $2,320 support level. This breakdown was triggered by escalating geopolitical tensions, as news broke that the United States had launched attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The announcement sent shockwaves through global markets, sparking widespread risk-off behavior and panic selling across crypto. Ethereum, already trading near the bottom of its six-week consolidation range, quickly reacted with a sharp drop, dragging the broader altcoin market with it. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels \u2013 Here\u2019s Why The move marks a critical shift in sentiment, as Ethereum now trades outside the range that had served as a battleground between bulls and bears for over a month. With volatility spiking and confidence shaken, traders are re-evaluating risk in light of escalating conflict in the Middle East and broader macroeconomic headwinds. According to top analyst Big Cheds, Ethereum&#8217;s weekly chart is now flirting with a potential tower top pattern completion \u2014 a bearish reversal structure that may signal further downside unless buyers reclaim key levels in the coming days. As the situation evolves, all eyes will remain on ETH\u2019s ability to hold new support levels or risk further decline in a fragile market environment. Ethereum Slides 22% From June Highs \u2013 All Eyes On Weekly Structure Ethereum has lost over 22% of its value since peaking in early June, as global instability and heightened selling pressure weigh heavily on market sentiment. The asset has now broken below its six-week range, triggering concern among investors and adding to uncertainty across the broader crypto space. With rising tensions in the Middle East\u2014particularly following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities\u2014the market has entered a risk-off environment, dragging altcoins like Ethereum into deeper retracements. Despite the volatility, Ethereum remains at the center of investor focus, as many still expect it to lead the next altseason. However, with bulls losing control of key support zones, confidence in a near-term rally continues to waver. Analysts are now split: while some predict a deeper retracement toward the $2,000 region, others argue that Ethereum is nearing exhaustion on the downside and may soon recover. Big Cheds points to Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart, where the price is currently flirting with a potential tower top pattern\u2014a bearish reversal structure. If this pattern confirms, ETH may face another wave of downside before finding demand at lower supply levels. If buyers step in during this pivotal moment, a recovery from this structure could quickly follow. The coming sessions will be critical in determining whether this breakdown extends or turns into a fakeout with bullish continuation. For now, traders should remain cautious, as Ethereum&#8217;s next move could define the tone of the altcoin market heading into July. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates Ethereum Breaks Down Below Support As Volatility Spikes Ethereum has officially broken below the $2,320 support level, signaling a shift in short-term market structure as shown in the 4-hour chart. After weeks of ranging between $2,320 and $2,650, ETH failed to reclaim its moving averages and lost bullish momentum. The price is now trading around $2,260, down sharply from its June highs near $2,900. This recent leg down follows a clean breakdown through the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs, confirming a strong bearish momentum. Volume spikes accompanied the drop, suggesting panic selling likely triggered by geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East. The price broke down aggressively with little resistance, meaning previous demand zones have now become weak. If buyers fail to step in quickly, Ethereum may revisit earlier May support levels around $2,100 or even $2,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move From a technical standpoint, the breakdown invalidates the previous consolidation range, opening the door for a possible extended correction. Until ETH reclaims $2,320 and stabilizes above its moving averages, the risk of continued downside remains high. Market participants should watch closely for volume shifts or bullish divergences, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure as uncertainty continues to dominate the macro environment. The next few sessions will be crucial for price discovery. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
