      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-risks-pullback-105000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has faced a lot of resistance above $110,000, suggesting the bears are trying to keep the digital asset from reclaiming its all-time high levels. This has been obvious with multiple rejections above $110,000 over the last few days, while the bulls have held support above $108,000. This trend plays into an analysis published by crypto analyst TehThomas, who had forecasted the rejection from $110,000. But what\u2019s more interesting is where Thomas sees the price going from here. Bitcoin Could Drop For Shallow Pullback In the analysis, Thomas explained what is happening with the Bitcoin price and why the pullback could happen. This begins with the breakout after falling toward $100,000 and then bouncing back again. The digital asset was able to quickly clear multiple fair value gaps on the 4-hour timeframes to claim its spot above $110,000. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises The crypto analyst explains that this move has triggered a shift in the sentiment toward the positive, and this has been followed by rising volumes, as well as impulsive candles. In all, this is quite bullish for the cryptocurrency. However, there is still a risk of a price decline from here. After filling multiple fair value gaps with strength, the crypto analyst believes this has set a precedent for the Bitcoin price. He expects the same pattern to play out for the cryptocurrency, which includes a rapid rise before a shallow pullback, and then a continuation from there. BTC Pullback Into $104,000 Territory The Bitcoin price recovery above $110,000 seems to have created a fair value gap below $107,000, which the crypto analyst believes will need to be filled. If this is the case, then it is possible that the price rally will not continue until this condition is fulfilled. Nevertheless, a pullback to the level would not be bearish, but rather provide a bounce-off point for the price recovery. Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash \u2013 Here Are The Targets Thomas referred to this trend as \u201ca classic breakout-fill-continue sequence\u201d, and the next thing in line is to fill the fair value gap. According to the shared chart, the crypto analyst sees the pullback taking the price back down below $105,000 and into the $104,000 territory before its next bounce. This would mean a 5% pullback, and going by the trends from this year so far, something that would be bad for altcoins. However, the conclusion remains that Bitcoin is still bullish from here. Once the fair value gap is filled, a strong push upward is expected, possibly toward new all-time highs. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a controlled retracement to fill the new 4H imbalance, after which price could continue pushing toward the major resistance area,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThe momentum is clean and structured\u2014until that changes, continuation remains the more likely path.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "The Bitcoin Options traders have been pricing in low implied volatility, but on-chain data shows a setup ripe for amplified price swings. Bitcoin Options ATM IV Has Been Trending Lower In its latest weekly report, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin looks from the perspective of on-chain analysis. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400? On-Chain Shows No Big Hurdles Ahead The indicator shared by Glassnode is the Realized Supply Density, which tells us about how concentrated the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply is around the current spot price. When the value of this metric is high, it means the investors have participated in a large amount of buying at or near the asset&#8217;s latest price. &#8220;In such environments, even modest price fluctuations can affect a broad swath of investors, often amplifying market sensitivity and, in turn, volatility potential,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by in the report. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Supply Density has gone through an uplift during the past few weeks, which suggests accumulation has taken place around the current spot price. &#8220;This concentration raises the probability of outsized reactions to price movements, increasing volatility risk in the near term,&#8221; notes Glassnode. While on-chain data may hint that volatility could go up in the future, it would appear the traders on the Options market don&#8217;t quite think the same, as the At-The-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IV) has been going down. The IV is a metric that represents the traders&#8217; expectations of how volatile Bitcoin will be over a given period, based on the pricing of Options contracts. The ATM version of the indicator specifically calculates this expectation based on Options closest to the latest spot price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back At $109,000, But HODLer Profit-Taking Down 89% Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Options ATM IV across different expiration timeframes: From the above graph, it&#8217;s apparent that the Bitcoin Options ATM IV has been going down for all major tenors, an indication that the traders don&#8217;t expect high volatility for the cryptocurrency in the near future. &#8220;Historically, such complacency in volatility pricing has often served as a counter-trend signal, preceding periods of heightened volatility,&#8221; says the analytics firm. With on-chain data suggesting increased volatility risk and this signal forming at the same time, it now remains to be seen how Bitcoin would develop in the coming days.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback Ethereum Breakout Eyes $3,100 Ethereum has reclaimed the key $2,800 barrier for the first time since February, nearing the $2,900 level on Wednesday morning. The King of Altcoins had been trading between the $2,475-$2,680 range since its May breakout, unable to turn the range\u2019s upper boundary into support. During last week\u2019s retracement, ETH dropped to the $2,400 support before bouncing over the weekend. The crypto market\u2019s recovery saw Ethereum surge toward the key resistance, finally breaking past it at the start of the week and hitting a three-month high of $2,879 today. Following this performance, Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show noted that the cryptocurrency had broken out of an ascending triangle formation and now targets the $3,100 resistance. The analyst previously highlighted ETH\u2019s triangle pattern, which began forming at the start of last month\u2019s recovery rally. During that period, the price compressed between the support and resistance lines, with the latter situated around the $2,700 mark. He forecasted a 15% surge toward the $3,100 level if the altcoin reclaimed the crucial resistance level. Based on this, Ethereum could climb another 10.7% if it holds its current range. Runefelt also pointed out another bullish formation in ETH\u2019s trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC). According to the ETH/BTC chart, Ethereum also formed a bullish pennant pattern during the May rally. Amid this week\u2019s recovery, the cryptocurrency has broken out of the formation\u2019s upper boundary, eyeing a 30% surge toward the 0.03300 mark. ETH To Repeat History? Market Watcher Kaleo highlighted the resemblance between ETH\u2019s performance between 2020 and 2025. According to the analyst, there are \u201ca lot of similarities on the chart to where we are now vs. where we were in 2020.\u201d As he explained, in the Spring of 2020, Ethereum experienced a major sell-off, fueled by the COVID-19 crash, which sent its price below a key higher timeframe (HFT) support. However, once the ascending trendline was reclaimed as support, ETH was \u201cup only for the next 20 months.\u201d Kaleo detailed the recent sell-off, caused by the Trump Tariffs scare, sent the altcoin below its multi-year ascending support trendline, adding that \u201cETH is currently on the verge of reclaiming that line.\u201d Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 \u2013 Is A Recovery Around The Corner?

To him, a new all-time high (ATH) is likely if the $3,800 resistance is reclaimed, while the rally\u2019s invalidation level is a close below the $2,200 mark.

At the time of writing, the crypto is trading at $109,693, reflecting a 0.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite this upward movement, the current price remains roughly 2% below its all-time high of over $111,000, recorded last month. This ongoing strength in price performance has been accompanied by notable on-chain signals, particularly from large holders.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers From $100K Dip While On-Chain Data Shows Rising Miner Activity Bitcoin Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside In his latest analysis, Dan observed that despite Bitcoin hovering near record levels, there is little evidence of the profit-taking behavior typically observed during previous market tops.

According to Darkfost, historical data shows that when Bitcoin approaches or breaches its all-time high, there is typically a sharp rise in exchange inflows, driven by whales seeking to take profits. This pattern was visible during earlier cycle peaks, where inflows reached $5.3 billion in early 2024, and even higher levels of $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion in previous cycles. A strong bullish signal from Binance whales! \u201cToday, however, inflows are just around $3 billion and are continuing to decline, suggesting that these whales prefer to keep holding.\u201d \u2013 By @Darkfost_Coc Full analysis \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/T1FlLnM4nK pic.twitter.com/O3XrqhAyEc \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 In contrast, recent inflows to Binance remain substantially lower. Darkfost reports current inflows hovering around $3 billion, and more importantly, on a declining trajectory. This divergence from historical patterns suggests that whales are refraining from selling at current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Their reduced activity implies an expectation that higher prices may lie ahead, and that they are positioning for potentially greater returns later in the cycle.

This link to big names has drawn fresh eyes to Tron\u2019s ecosystem. On-Chain Growth Signals According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked on Tron reached over $5 billion. On June 6, the network saw 4.50 million returning user addresses. Those stats suggest people keep coming back to DeFi apps on Tron, but it\u2019s worth watching whether those funds stay in place or chase higher yields on other chains. Bullish Bets in Derivatives Based on CoinGlass data, TRX derivatives open interest rose by 8.25% over the past 24 hours to $329 million. The weighted funding rate open interest rose to 0.0098%, indicative that bullish long positions are greater than shorts. Short liquidations in the past day were almost double that of longs, which settled a bearish bet wave. Technical analysis supports this positive perspective. The RSI on the daily chart is inching up to the overbought region, indicating heightened buying pressure. A recent MACD crossover drove histogram bars into positive territory, which means momentum has favored the buyers. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Meanwhile, traders will keep a close eye on Bitcoin\u2019s moves too.
