      "summary": "Ethereum has experienced significant volatility in recent days, driven largely by escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. After breaking down from the range that had held since early May, ETH fell sharply to $2,100, triggering widespread concern among investors. The breakdown was largely attributed to the market&#8217;s reaction to the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, which escalated the conflict between Israel and Iran. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction However, markets quickly responded to positive developments. Ethereum rebounded strongly above the $2,400 level following reports that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire, temporarily easing global risk sentiment. This relief rally brought new optimism to the Ethereum market, especially amid signs of institutional confidence. According to data shared by top analyst Ted Pillows, a major whale or institutional entity purchased another $8.91 million worth of ETH, continuing an aggressive accumulation streak. Over the past three weeks, this same entity has reportedly bought $422 million in Ethereum, signaling strong conviction despite recent market stress. This wave of accumulation suggests that long-term players may view the current price zone as a key opportunity, reinforcing the idea that Ethereum could be building a base for its next major move once broader conditions stabilize. Ethereum Surges As Ceasefire Ignites Market Optimism Ethereum surged over 14% following reports of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, providing a much-needed relief rally after weeks of geopolitical tension and uncertainty. The news sparked a wave of bullish momentum across the market, with ETH rebounding sharply from recent lows near $2,100 to trade firmly above the $2,400 mark. Bulls, who had lost control amid panic selling, are now showing signs of strength as the market prepares for its next decisive move. Despite this rebound, caution remains. The broader macroeconomic environment continues to tighten, with rising concerns over a potential US recession, high Treasury yields, and sustained hawkishness from the Federal Reserve. These factors could weigh on risk assets in the weeks ahead, putting Ethereum\u2019s rally to the test. Nonetheless, optimism is building, especially around the possibility of the long-awaited altseason\u2014one that many believe will be led by Ethereum. Adding fuel to this narrative is the growing trend of whale accumulation. According to insights shared by analyst Ted Pillows, a major whale or institutional entity has just acquired another $8.91 million worth of ETH. This purchase adds to a staggering $422 million in Ethereum accumulated over the past three weeks. Such aggressive buying suggests that large players are positioning themselves for a major move ahead, likely expecting Ethereum to be at the forefront of the next market cycle. As ETH consolidates above key levels, the accumulation trend could act as a foundational force supporting higher prices, especially if macro and geopolitical risks stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support \u2013 $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move ETH Reclaims $2,400 Following Sharp Rebound Ethereum has reclaimed the $2,400 level after a swift rebound from a breakdown near $2,100. The recent candle structure on the 3-day chart shows a strong wick to the downside, followed by a recovery, reflecting the impact of geopolitical developments, most notably the ceasefire between Iran and Israel. This bounce prevented a deeper selloff and has brought Ethereum back above a key psychological level. Looking at the chart, ETH remains under pressure from the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, currently acting as resistance around the $2,638 and $2,779 zones. Price also recently broke a short-term descending trendline and is now attempting to consolidate above it. This suggests the potential for a trend reversal if bulls can sustain momentum and push through the moving average cluster.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-next-crypto-to-explode-100x-as-circle-hit-60b-amidst-investor-frenzy/",
      "summary": "This may not always feel like a bull market, with geopolitical tensions boiling over in Iran and Ukraine. Bitcoin has traded largely sideways since its ATH over a month ago, and most of the top 10 cryptos by market cap have experienced declines over the same timeframe: $XRP: \u20134.5% $ETH: \u20133.5% $BNB: \u20133.3% $SOL: \u201316% $TRX: \u20130.4% $DOGE: \u201325% $ADA: \u201321% But while most blue-chip cryptos have slid to the netherworld, the companies behind some of them have taken off. Circle Takes Off, Coinbase Profits Over Past Month Take Circle (Circle Internet Group, $CRCL): the company behind the stablecoin $USDC is having a decent month after its IPO. $CRCL stock has risen a cool 750% in the past thirty days. That gives Circle a market cap of almost $64B, larger than the market cap of its top-10 stablecoin $USDC \u2013 market cap, $61B. Circle stock closed the last session at $263.45. Circle isn\u2019t the only crypto company seeing major gains. Coinbase didn\u2019t have an IPO, but it did post a solid 16% gain over the past month, closing at $307.59. Both companies, major players in the crypto economy, are prime examples of how crypto continues to attract TradFi investors despite temporary market decline. GENIUS Bill Fuels Circle Frenzy, Sets Stage for New Crypto Success IPO aside, the passing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act may have set the stage for Circle\u2019s success. The bill cleared the US Senate and is now bound for the House. Should it pass there, the largest economy in the world would have a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill did more than set up stablecoins; it provided a clear indication that sensible and workable regulation is coming, one way or another. That gives much-needed stability, setting up new crypto projects to launch in a favorable environment. Here are three such projects poised to achieve their own double, triple, or even 10x in the months to come. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Fastest Layer in Bitcoin History Ready to Take Off $2T market cap, $105K token price \u2013 Bitcoin has everything, right? Not quite. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to give Bitcoin the one thing it lacks \u2013 a fully functional, SVM-powered Layer 2. The Bitcoin Relay Program allows users to send and receive $BTC nearly instantly. By monitoring a designated address as a Canonical Bridge, Bitcoin Hyper unlocks the full power of everything from zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to staking and DeFi with the world\u2019s largest crypto. Staking $HYPER doesn\u2019t have to wait until the Layer 2 is fully launched, though; presale investors can stake now, earning 493% APY during the presale. $HYPER currently costs $0.012, but our price prediction shows the token could reach $0.08625 by the end of next year for 619% gains. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised $1.5M in a matter of weeks and looks set to ride the bullish momentum to new heights. You can learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper here. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Find and Trade the Best Solana Meme Coins on Telegram Meme coins are funny things. Sometimes they become big $DOGEs, mentioned glowingly by Elon Musk, and are part of common parlance. More commonly, they spend their entire life cycle out of the limelight, trading underground on platforms like Telegram. Average traders may never even hear about them, and by the time they do, the best trading opportunities are long gone. No more! With Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Snorter Bot, Solana\u2019s best-kept secret meme coins are brought to light, and fantastic trading opportunities uncovered. Snorter Bot offers: Fast, safe swaps Automated sniping tools Limit orders Honeypot detection Rugpull protection Copy trading What is Snorter? It&#8217;s the bot that gives any trader the tools they need to successfully trade low-cap Solana meme coins \u2013 and find those 100x opportunities before anyone else. $SNORT currently costs $0.0961 with $1.2M raised in the presale so far. 3. Memereum ($MEME) \u2013 DeFi, Memes, Insurance Combined $MEME tokens power an innovative DeFi platform that leverages comprehensive asset protection for your crypto investments. It\u2019s a unique approach, but gives both seasoned investors and crypto newbies a way to protect their investments. Despite the addition of insurance options, Memereum provides all the benefits of an advanced DeFi platform, including a DEX and crypto card. The presale is in its final stages, and has raised $2M so far. Money Flows In, Token Prices Go Up? As Circle and Coinbase see bright days ahead, will corporate earnings lead to token price increases? Bitcoin Hyper and Snorter Token offer key features in the growing crypto economy; as regulation improves, look for both new cryptos to explode. Do your own research before investing \u2013 this is not financial advice."

      "title": "Ethereum Bounces Hard After Support Bluff, A False Alarm Or Fresh Rally?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bounces-hard/",
      "summary": "Ethereum just pulled a surprise upward move after dipping below key support and its rising trendline. The sudden rebound caught bears off guard, fueling speculation about whether this was a mere fakeout or the start of a fresh rally. Fakeout Fools The Bears: Ethereum Reclaims Critical Support In a recent post on X, UniChartz drew attention to a classic fakeout move by ETH, where the price momentarily dipped below a significant support level and an ascending trendline, only to reclaim both shortly after. This sudden reversal disrupted bearish expectations, especially for those anticipating a deeper drop. Instead of confirming a breakdown, ETH snapped back above the key zone with notable strength, shaking up short-term sentiment. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Headed For Crash To $2,000 With Current Price Action According to UniChartz, this kind of false breakdown often traps bearish traders and can act as fuel for an upward move if momentum builds. The reclaim of the support zone is a strong technical signal, indicating that bulls are still in control for now. It not only invalidated the bearish thesis but also injected fresh optimism into the market, hinting at the possibility of a short-term rally. Still, UniChartz cautioned that follow-through is critical. If ETH can hold above this reclaimed area and form higher lows, it could set the stage for continued upside. However, any weakness or failure to maintain the level could lead to another shakeout. From Breakdown To Breakout? Key Levels In Focus After reclaiming the previously lost support level, Ethereum is showing signs of strength, but whether it can sustain this momentum remains the key question. The bounce has surprised many, especially after what looked like a clean break below a rising trendline and horizontal support. The current price action suggests bulls are regaining control, but the road ahead is lined with several resistance hurdles that could stall or reverse the advance. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of 2021? Here\u2019s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow The first level to watch lies around the $2,858 level, where Ethereum previously struggled to maintain traction. This area marks a confluence of short-term resistance from prior price rejections. A decisive close above this could open the door for a push toward $3,360, a level that has historically acted as a pivot zone and may attract both profit-taking and fresh short positions. Beyond that, the $3,659 level stands as a key psychological and technical barrier. This region is where bears have previously reasserted control, and reclaiming it would be a statement of intent from the bulls. Only a sustained break above this zone, ideally on strong volume, would signal a shift back toward a more dominant uptrend, potentially eyeing $4,100 and beyond. For now, the reclaimed support offers a solid base, but Ethereum\u2019s upward journey depends on the bulls defending it convincingly and clearing these major resistance zones with strength and consistency.

      "title": "Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-further-crash-to-94000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been facing significant volatility and downward pressure lately. However, analysts warn that the downtrend may not be over yet, as projections point to a deeper price crash toward $94,000 soon. According to Bitcoin\u2019s Elliott Wave count, the cryptocurrency is currently in a vulnerable phase that may trigger more losses, despite the market\u2019s efforts to rebound. Still, the analyst notes that the next move after this projected crash could see Bitcoin potentially reversing upward to new levels. Bitcoin Faces Epic Crash As Wave 2 Unfolds Luca, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has unveiled a foreboding forecast for the Bitcoin price, warning that the flagship cryptocurrency could still be headed for more pain in the short term. The analyst has outlined an Elliott Wave count for Bitcoin that suggests that the cryptocurrency has not bottomed yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again According to the 8-hour chart breakdown, Bitcoin is in the midst of completing a Wave 2 correction within a broader bullish trend. The chart shows a five-wave corrective structure unfolding, with the final leg potentially leading to a price crash toward the $94,000 support region. This level aligns with both the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement and a key support zone. While Luca reveals that some signs indicate that the correction might have bottomed already, the analyst maintains that one final push lower remains possible before Bitcoin\u2019s next bullish move. The projected dip toward $94,000 is framed as the concluding move of the internal Wave (v) of Wave 2, creating what could be a textbook completion of a corrective cycle. With the Bitcoin price currently sitting above the $100,000 psychological level at $105,574, a decline to $94,000 would represent a massive blow to its slowly recovering value. Despite the possibility of an upcoming bullish move, this 11.3% decline from current prices could significantly slow down BTC\u2019s momentum, putting more strain on the already volatile market. Nevertheless, Luca suggests that this decline could present a prime accumulation opportunity, indicating that now may be a favorable time to buy Bitcoin. Game-Changing Reversal With Wave 3 Push Despite the potential for a further pullback, Luca&#8217;s broader outlook for Bitcoin remains highly bullish. The Elliott Wave count on the chart signals that BTC is preparing to exit Wave 2 and initiate Wave 3\u2014one of the most powerful phases in the five-wave structure. Once the projected correction to the $94,000 level concludes, Luca expects a strong reversal that could catapult the cryptocurrency to new ATHs. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters \u2018New Era\u2019 A large purple upward arrow on the chart visualizes the anticipated Wave 3 surge, pointing toward a possible target zone above $122,000. This projection is rooted in the technical and historical tendency for Wave 3 to be the steepest and most aggressive wave in the Elliott Wave cycle. With Bitcoin still hovering near a high-confluence support zone, the stage appears set for a decisive rebound in the coming weeks, provided macro conditions don\u2019t shift dramatically.
