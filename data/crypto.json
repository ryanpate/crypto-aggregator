      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/179000-or-79000-bitcoin-critical-cycle-pivot/",
      "summary": "A popular crypto analyst has issued a stark cyclical warning that could define Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory for the rest of the summer. Dr. Cat, known for his integrated use of Ichimoku Cloud analysis, Elliott Wave Theory, and proprietary time-cycle forecasting, posted an intricate scenario on X suggesting Bitcoin now stands at a pivotal inflection point\u2014one that may ultimately determine whether the next major move is to $179,000 or back down to $79,000. Bitcoin Faces Make-or-Break Moment \u201cIf we set a daily high between the 25th and 27th of June,\u201d Dr. Cat began, referencing the window derived from his Time Theory model, \u201cand it turns out to be a lower high per the Wave Theory, then a lower low should follow.\u201d The implications, however, go far beyond near-term downside. \u201cIf a lower low comes, we invalidate the weekly cycle which implies no bottom before mid-July to mid-August.\u201d According to the forecast timeline, the earliest potential bottom would fall between July 14 and August 17, with a primary target range from July 28 to August 3, incorporating a \u00b12 week deviation. That timing model dovetails with the chart\u2019s behavior around critical Ichimoku levels. Dr. Cat emphasized that Bitcoin is currently \u201cmaking a bearish retest of the weekly Tenkan Sen,\u201d adding that yesterday&#8217;s attempt to reclaim that level failed: \u201cPrice touched Tenkan Sen yesterday but I saw that it would open below it today.\u201d Related Reading: Trump\u2019s Truth Social Officialy Files For Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs With NYSE The Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen\u2014two key lines in the Ichimoku system\u2014are not just flat; they are structurally unconvincing despite a nominal 10% price advance. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a real uptrend,\u201d noted one user, to which Dr. Cat replied: \u201cThis is simply a neutral chart trying to flip bullish.\u201d He elaborated that this neutrality means neither bullish nor bearish continuation is guaranteed, but warned that inaction or false optimism at this stage could expose traders to a cascading downside. One of the most significant technical levels lies just beneath current price. \u201cThe super key support of 93.2K (weekly Kijun Sen) is relatively close\u2014and too close to hold if the time cycles play out,\u201d Dr. Cat stated. A failure of that level would likely trigger a deeper reversion to the 3-week Kijun Sen, which remains unvisited and is currently positioned near $75K but rising. The entire bearish cascade remains \u201ccompletely valid and with a very real chance of playing out,\u201d unless Bitcoin manages to break above $110.6K after June 27. Such a move would invalidate both the time and wave-based lower-high structure and neutralize the scenario before it unfolds. But until then, Dr. Cat is urging traders to look beyond surface-level price movements. \u201cMost people look at whether price goes up or down but don\u2019t look at how it does it,\u201d he said. Recalling his accurate bullish stance in April and May\u2014when others were waiting for retracement\u2014and his caution in early June, he emphasized the importance of reading the structure, not just the candles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern\u2014Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead \u201cThe weekly chart was one candle away from a bullish TK cross, which would\u2019ve implied big bullish continuation. But I waited. Then the market dumped,\u201d he reminded followers. \u201cNow it is relatively similar\u2026 dramatic reversals happen as close to invalidation as possible so everyone is tested and trapped to the limit.\u201d In summary, Dr. Cat\u2019s outlook remains balanced\u2014but volatile. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you I can read the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that you need to distinguish neutral from bullish charts, which many people can\u2019t\u2014and suffer the consequences.\u201d With time cycles converging and Ichimoku structures flashing indecision, Bitcoin now stands at a binary junction. The next high or low could lock in a multi-week trend, with targets as distant as $179K\u2014or as painful as $79K\u2014hanging in the balance. \u201cThis is simply a neutral chart trying to flip bullish. Which can certainly flip bullish pretty soon but until that happens I discuss whether first comes 179K or 79K with pretty much equal probability and I&#8217;m warning about an absolutely valid scenario which is on the table unless the chart flips bullish,\u201d Dr. Cat concludes.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-etf-race-heats-up-more-solana-etfs-planned-as-snorter-bot-corners-market/",
      "summary": "The SEC\u2019s filing cabinet has to be pretty full these days, and their \u2018paperwork pending\u2019 stack is getting perilously high. Invesco Ltd and Galaxy Digital LP combined forces to offer another Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). They filed the appropriate paperwork with the SEC and joined at least 12 other potential spot and future ETFs on the SEC to rule on their status. The competition for the leading $SOL ETF takes place at the most visible end of the crypto ecosystem. Far lower down, there\u2019s a different race on, with Snorter poised to corner the market in the fast-paced world of Solana meme coins on Telegram. It\u2019s two ends of the same spectrum and speaks to the growing strength and versatility of the Solana ecosystem. Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF Ready to List Why the race for a Solana ETF? Partly because of the tremendous success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: $IBIT: iShares Bitcoin Trust, $70.6B Assets Under Management (AUM) $FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, $20.4B AUM $GBTC: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, $19.6B AUM $ETHA: iShares Ethereum Trust, $3.9B AUM $ETHE: Grayscale Ethereum Trust, $2.8B AUM It\u2019s no surprise that more players are ready to enter the game, particularly as the realms of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) move ever-closer together. Only $BTC and $ETH currently have single-asset crypto ETFs, but the pile of pending filings includes everything from $XRP to $SOL to the first-ever NFT ETF, with Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU). And with single-asset crypto ETFs rolling along, institutions aren\u2019t waiting around for the SEC. They\u2019ve already started to move towards multi-asset ETFs. Converting Existing Funds to Multi-Asset ETFs One of the holdups so far has been that the SEC lacks a clear set of rules around crypto ETFs, even after the $BTC and $ETH approvals went ahead. The question now is, will the SEC hold approvals until they draw up new rules? Or will they approve first and develop the rule set as they go? There is some time pressure at work here. Grayscale wants to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to an ETF, and the deadline for that is July 2. That fund already holds a number of crypto assets, including $XRP, $SOL, and $ADA. If the conversion is approved, look for others to follow. Investment managers from Bitwise to Hasdex have plans to convert other funds to multi-asset ETFs that include cryptos. The funds sit at the top of the financial and investment world, and every one that gets approved boosts Solana\u2019s long-term outlook just slightly. But much, much farther down, there\u2019s another reason to be excited for Solana. The frenetic, fast-paced world of Solana meme coin trading just got a tool that could bring much-needed clarity and make finding those 10x or 100x opportunities much easier. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 One Bot to Rule Them All for Meme Coin Trading on Telegram What do you need to find and trade memes on Telegram? You need: Lightning-fast transactions and swaps Automated sniping, to get in and out at the right time Protection from rug pulls, honeypots, and front-running trades Thankfully, traders now have Snorter Bot, the meme coin-styled trading bot designed specifically for trading low-cap Solana memes on Telegram. The $SNORT token powers the bot, providing for rapid trade execution and the lowest fees possible. The project\u2019s presale has already raised nearly $1.3M in a few weeks, indicating broad support. The roadmap includes launching the bot on Solana but expanding to EVM-compatible chains post-launch. In the meantime, the plans feature a token bridge and a built-in Telegram dashboard. No more avoiding Telegram tokens; traders can dive in with confidence with Snorter. Visit the Snorter website to learn more. Solana ETFs Mark the Next Stage of Crypto Adoption As plans proceed, even the rate of ETF filings indicates just how fast crypto adoption is moving. From Wall Street boardrooms to Telegram chats, Solana is becoming increasingly accessible to investors of every stripe. Keep an eye on Snorter, and another on the broader Solana ecosystem. But remember \u2013 always do your own research. This isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "summary": "XRP spent the past forty-eight hours coiling into a textbook inflection zone, and the 15-minute chart published by independent analyst Casi makes it hard to miss where the battle lines now stand. Price is hovering at $2.18, clinging to a steeply rising trendline that has underpinned every impulsive thrust since the local swing low near the 0.618 retracement at $1.9824 on 23 June. That trendline intersects a horizontal shelf of former resistance-turned-support at the 1.618 extension measured from the same base move, labelled on the chart at $2.186. The confluence forms the geometric \u201capex of consolidation\u201d Casi has been highlighting on X. XRP Price At Breaking Point \u201cThis trendline is everything right now,\u201d Casi wrote. \u201cWe just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation\u2026 that\u2019s the most critical level on the chart, short-term.\u201d The most recent corrective pullback already tagged the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the advance, exactly at $2.145, before bulls forced a reaction. As long as candles continue to close above that retracement\u2014effectively the floor of the micro-range\u2014Casi argues that the underlying market structure remains constructive. A decisive break beneath $2.145, by contrast, would represent both a loss of the diagonal trendline and a surrender of the consolidation base, signalling short-term weakness and, in his words, \u201copening the door to a deeper flush.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Pullback Nearly Complete\u2014Next Stop: $8 To $12, Says Analyst Overhead, XRP must still reckon with layered resistance. The first ceiling sits at $2.20, but the level called out as \u201cthe next big test\u201d is the thicker pink band at $2.25. That mark capped price repeatedly during yesterday\u2019s U.S. session and coincides with a prior 1.272 extension of the late-May corrective leg. \u201cIf we can flip that level, we\u2019ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test,\u201d Casi noted, \u201cand from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically!\u201d If price can reclaim $2.25 on expanding volume and then retest it as support, the chart leaves an unobstructed lane toward the 2.618 extension at $2.296\u2014effectively $2.30\u2014and, by projection, the $2.69 Fibonacci target that would complete the measured-move roadmap Casi is tracking. Related Reading: XRP To $30 Beyond 2026? Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch Momentum, however, is not yet offering a clean green light. The lower pane shows a 14-period RSI capped by its own descending trendline that has compressed every rally since 24 June. With the oscillator printing 46.24 (signal) versus 43.59 (base line) at the time of the screenshot, the gauge is climbing but still mid-range. A marginal higher high in price paired with a lower high in RSI would etch a textbook bearish divergence\u2014an outcome Casi told one follower he is \u201cexpecting to set up\u201d if XRP pierces $2.25 before consolidating anew. \u201cI think this next high will form a bearish div,\u201d he added. \u201cThe RSI is telling me it\u2019s about to set that up.\u201d In short, the token is balanced on a knife-edge: the bull case hinges on the integrity of the $2.145\u2013$2.186 support complex and a breakout through $2.25, while the bear case rests on trendline failure and an RSI divergence confirming upside exhaustion. With liquidity thinning into the weekend, the resolution of this narrow consolidation could shape the next wave\u2014whether that proves to be the ignition of a larger third impulse or the start of a deeper corrective detour. As Casi put it, \u201cThis is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.19.

      "summary": "After suffering a major price crash back during the weekend, the Ethereum price has enjoyed an over 10% bounce that has put it back above major support levels. However, even with the recovery, the altcoin sits on shaky ground with geopolitical and macroeconomic factors still unstable. On the charts, there is also uncertainty as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has failed to make any definitive moves from here, showing inconsistencies in movement. Ethereum Price Struggling At EMA Crypto analyst Swallow Academy noted that the Ethereum price has returned to trading at its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) earlier in the week after bouncing from its weekend lows. This has been referred to as the level of interest and sits around the $2,400 level, which has served as major support in the past. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Is Moving According To Plan, Here\u2019s Why $1.90 Is Important The harsh drop from the weekend that pushed ETH from $2,500 to $2,150 has no doubt dented sentiment and sparked caution among investors. But the retest of the EMA at $2,400 suggests that buyers are still exerting their force and have been pushing up the price. Given these recent developments, the crypto analyst explains that it is currently a waiting game for the Ethereum price. From here, it could go either way, as confirmation is needed for which direction it is headed next. A breakout from here could move it back above the $2,800 resistance. However, a crash could be confirmation of rejection, sending Ethereum spiraling back toward lows at $2,000. Mapping Out Next Steps As the Ethereum price continues to show signs of continuation, crypto analysts have begun to map out where the altcoin might be headed next. Mister Spread pointed to the fact that Ethereum had actually shown a bullish Power of 3 (PO3), consisting of accumulation, deviation, and expansion. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000? The accumulation phase has been completed, and is now in the phase of deviation, explaining the price crash. Now, the price seems to already be breaking out of the deviation box, suggesting that the expansion phase will be coming sooner than expected. Once the expansion phase is in motion, the crypto analyst expects the Ethereum price to move back into the supply area of $2,800-$3,000. However, if the price fails to climb and falls back below $2,100, then this bullish thesis would be invalidated. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

Nonetheless, some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency could be gearing up for a massive breakout beyond the local highs. Related Reading: Injective Prepares For Bullish Reversal Amid 25% Recovery \u2013 Analyst Forecasts Massive Breakout Solana Sits At Decisive Level On Wednesday, Solana fell to the $143 mark after failing to reclaim a crucial area lost over a week ago. Following the May breakout, the cryptocurrency hovered between the $148-$184 price range, hitting a four-month high of $187 at the end of last month. However, the June market pullback saw SOL lose its range and move toward the $144-$148 levels. This area was briefly lost during the weekend retrace, with Solana falling to the $125 support level before recovering. Over the past three days, the altcoin has surged nearly 15%, touching the $148 barrier on Wednesday morning, which has been one of the key levels since May. After recovering from the recent drop, SOL has attempted to reclaim this level, but was rejected once again. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted that Solana \u201cjust completed a very nice V-shaped recovery from the low,\u201d but noted that the cryptocurrency is at a \u201cvery delicate level\u201d as it trades within the $144-$148 zone. He suggested that investors should pay attention to this area, as a reclaim of the $148 resistance could propel the price to a \u201cquick move to the upside.\u201d On the contrary, rejection from this level and losing the $144 range low could signal that the recent price action was a bearish retest.
