      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-mirrors-bitcoin-2020-breakout-setup-historic-run-incoming/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading at critical levels after breaking past the $2,500 mark earlier this quarter, now attempting to reclaim momentum and push into higher resistance. Despite global macroeconomic pressures\u2014including rising US Treasury yields and persistent trade tensions between the US and China\u2014ETH continues to show resilience. Market analysts believe that Ethereum could be leading the charge into a long-anticipated altseason, provided it holds key levels and breaks above current supply. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target \u2013 Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? Top analyst Ted Pillows recently pointed to a compelling technical pattern: Ethereum has now posted four consecutive two-week green candles, a formation that mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s price structure in early 2020 following the March crash. That period marked the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s legendary bull run to $69,000. According to Pillows, the similarities between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025 are \u201cjust mind blowing,\u201d sparking renewed interest from traders who see Ethereum\u2019s current consolidation as a bullish continuation. With investor sentiment slowly recovering and technicals turning favorable, the market is watching ETH closely. If history is any guide, this consolidation could mark the calm before Ethereum\u2019s next major leg higher. However, macro risks still linger, and timing will be critical. Ethereum Resilience Sparks Hopes Of 2020-Like Rally Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,600 level, showing resilience amid global macro uncertainty and volatile market conditions. This consolidation around key support has many investors and analysts anticipating a breakout that could lead Ethereum into a new rally phase, potentially triggering a broader altseason. Despite growing concerns around systemic risk in the bond market and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, Ethereum continues to attract buyers, signaling confidence in its long-term strength. Analysts are watching this range closely. Many believe that if Ethereum can maintain support and break above near-term resistance, it could gain serious momentum. One of the more compelling arguments for a bullish outlook comes from Ted Pillows, who highlights a striking similarity between Ethereum\u2019s current structure and Bitcoin\u2019s behavior in 2020. According to Pillows, Ethereum has now printed four consecutive two-week green candles since bottoming, just as Bitcoin did after the March 2020 crash. That pattern marked the start of BTC\u2019s legendary run to $69,000. The comparison has sparked optimism that ETH may be preparing for a similar breakout, especially if it clears resistance near $2,700\u2013$2,800. While the macro environment remains tense, this technical structure\u2014paired with rising confidence in ETH\u2019s strength\u2014keeps bulls hopeful that a major move is on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC \u2013 Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Consolidation Above Support Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,607, consolidating just above the 34-period EMA on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near $2,594. After the strong surge in early May that saw ETH rally from under $2,000 to highs near $2,850, the price has moved into a tight consolidation range. This sideways action reflects market indecision as buyers and sellers battle for control. Despite the recent volatility, ETH has continued to post higher lows, indicating ongoing bullish pressure. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are aligned below the current price, all trending upward, signaling that the broader trend remains intact. The price is finding consistent support from the 50-period SMA around the $2,590\u2013$2,600 zone, which is a key level to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty \u2013 Analyst A decisive break above the short-term resistance near $2,680 would be needed to confirm continuation toward $2,800 and potentially retest previous highs. On the downside, a break below $2,590 could trigger a pullback toward $2,500 or lower, especially if BTC shows weakness. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-needs-0-40-breakout-salvage-bull-case/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s six-month slide may be about to reach its moment of truth, according to independent market commentator VisionPulsed, who told followers on June 4 that the memecoin must vault the long-standing ceiling at roughly $0.40 \u201ceither this week or next\u201d if the broader bullish structure is to survive the summer. In a video analysis, the analyst pointed to a second consecutive \u201cblue bar\u201d flashing on Ethereum\u2019s momentum oscillator, a signal he treats as a reliable harbinger of imminent, high-magnitude moves across the digital-asset complex. \u201cThe last time we had two blue bars on Ethereum was way back when we were still young and optimistic,\u201d he said, invoking memories of August 2023. \u201cWe printed five that time and the market moved sixteen percent. We\u2019re at two now; by Sunday we\u2019ll probably have four, which tells me the move should come next week.\u201d Dogecoin Needs June Rally To Avert Summer Slump Although the blue-bar framework is native to Ethereum, VisionPulsed argued that its read-through for Bitcoin and, by correlation, Dogecoin is more important than ever. He noted that Bitcoin\u2019s own hash-ribbon metric\u2014formed when the network\u2019s 30-day and 60-day hash-rate moving averages compress\u2014has followed a strictly \u201csell for two weeks, then rally\u201d pattern through the current cycle. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been selling off for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically in this bull market, that\u2019s when Bitcoin resets and moves higher. If that plays out again, Dogecoin should finally get the lift it\u2019s been denied since February.\u201d Related Reading: June Or Doom: Dogecoin Faces 6 Red Months If It Fails To Surge, Predicts Analyst The crux of his thesis sits on a 70-day timing model derived from Dogecoin\u2019s prior impulse lows. Measuring from the most recent trough, the 70-day mark falls on 14 June. \u201cEvery major upswing in Dogecoin during this cycle has come 60 to 80 days after a bottom,\u201d he explained, scrolling through historical candles on screen. \u201cWe\u2019re right on that window\u2014if we\u2019re going to break higher, it almost has to be now.\u201d VisionPulsed acknowledged his own track record of slipping deadlines\u2014\u201cone for five hundred,\u201d he joked\u2014but insisted the structure remains statistically sound. \u201cIf we don\u2019t rally next week, I\u2019m never putting dates on anything again,\u201d he told viewers, before adding a caveat that has become the headline takeaway. \u201cDogecoin has to clear $0.40. If we can\u2019t do that, the bear case strengthens dramatically: June down, July probably down, September seasonally weak, and suddenly you\u2019re talking eight red months out of nine.\u201d Pressed by commenters about the depth of a potential downside scenario, the analyst pointed to Ethereum for context. A bullish resolution, he said, could lift ETH to roughly $3,200 before a summer consolidation and possibly $4,200 by early autumn, a path that in his view would drag Dogecoin well north of the $0.40 trigger. Failure, however, \u201csets up a very large move down, maybe sub-$2,000 on ETH,\u201d a slide that would likely leave Dogecoin retesting multi-month lows. \u201cWhichever way we go,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis going to determine the rest of the summer.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The urgency is aggravated by Dogecoin\u2019s mounting sequence of monthly losses: five red candles since January, with only a brief reprieve in April. \u201cSix red months out of seven is staring us in the face,\u201d VisionPulsed said. \u201cJune doesn\u2019t have to be a vertical move, but it does have to be green\u2014or at least show a decisive breakout\u2014because otherwise, where is the bull run?\u201d Market structure rather than sentiment, he stressed, underpins the call. Bitcoin already sits near cycle highs while Dogecoin still trades markedly below its own year-to-date peak, a divergence he interprets as latent leverage. \u201cIf Bitcoin punches through its local top, it typically drags Doge,\u201d he said, referencing earlier intervals in 2024 when BTC strength eventually translated into delayed but exaggerated moves in the memecoin. Whether that historical choreography can repeat depends, in his framework, on the next few daily closes. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely getting more energy built up,\u201d he said, pointing to narrowing Bollinger Bands and declining on-chain activity. \u201cI don\u2019t think the large move is here yet, but by late this week\u2014or early next week at the latest\u2014you should get your answer.\u201d For traders who still believe the four-year cycle remains intact, the analyst\u2019s $0.40 line in the sand arrives almost exactly one calendar year before the next projected Bitcoin top in October 2026. \u201cIf Doge can\u2019t start moving now, the entire timing model gets pushed off course,\u201d he warned. \u201cI genuinely think June is a make-or-break month.\u201d At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s available coins for trading have dropped sharply. That change could push prices higher if demand holds up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge According to Sygnum Bank\u2019s June 2025 Monthly Investment Outlook, the liquid supply of Bitcoin fell by about 30% over the last 18 months. In that time, nearly 1 million BTC left exchanges. That means fewer coins are ready to move at a moment\u2019s notice. Liquid Supply Tightens Based on reports from Sygnum Bank, exchange balances dropped by around 1 million BTC since late 2023. That amount equals roughly 5% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply. When coins leave exchanges, they often go into cold storage or long-term funds. Some of these funds include new exchange-traded funds and corporate buyers issuing equity or debt to buy Bitcoin. If coins are locked away, traders have to compete for a smaller pool of available coins. That gap between supply and demand can cause bigger price swings on the upside. Institutions And State Moves Three US states have now passed laws to hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves. New Hampshire already signed its bill into law. Texas is expected to follow soon. A third state is also moving forward, though details are still pending. In addition, governments abroad are paying attention. Pakistan\u2019s government has said it will look into Bitcoin reserves. In the UK, the Reform Party\u2014currently leading in election polls\u2014plans to study something similar. When a state or country actually buys Bitcoin for its coffers, it can spark more buying. That act has a double effect: it creates immediate demand and it signals that public institutions see Bitcoin as a store of value. Safe-Haven Status Strengthens Rising uncertainty over the US dollar and US debt worries have driven some investors toward Bitcoin. In May, as US Treasury prices slid on concerns about rising debt levels, digital gold and physical gold saw higher interest. Bitcoin is being viewed more like a hedge against dollar weakness. On days when Treasuries wobble, some cash moves into crypto markets. Larger swings on the upside than on the downside also hint that institutions may be soaking up dips more quickly. Sygnum\u2019s data shows that since June 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s upward moves have been larger than its downward moves. That may be a sign that big players have become more confident in holding through small sell-offs.

When more institutions issue tokenized assets, the whole crypto space could benefit. Renewed activity on Ethereum often spills back into Bitcoin. That could add to overall demand for top coins.

      "summary": "Bitcoin is drifting just above $105,000 on June 5, its lowest realized volatility in almost two years, yet Swan, the Los-Angeles-based \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d financial services firm, contends the market is on the verge of its most radical re-pricing ever. The Last Chance To Buy? In a X thread on Wednesday night, the company argued that the familiar four-year boom-and-bust cadence is giving way to \u201cthe last rotation\u201d\u2014a silent transfer of coins from retail speculators to institutions whose investment horizons stretch decades. \u201cPeople less committed to the long term are exiting [\u2026] and a whole new class of investors is entering,\u201d Swan is quoting Michael Saylor, framing the hand-off from retail traders to corporate treasuries, ETFs and multinationals such as BlackRock and Fidelity. So far, 2025 has defied the script. The third calendar year of every prior cycle\u20142013, 2017 and 2021\u2014delivered the vertical moves that defined those eras. This year has offered \u201cbig moves, but also shallower corrections and longer periods of sideways chop,\u201d Swan writes, conceding that the price action \u201cis boring people.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Strength As Long-Term Holder Realized Cap Surges Past $20 Billion \u2013 Details The firm\u2019s thesis is that boredom masks an invisible supply squeeze: long-time holders taking profits above $100,000 while \u201clong-only buyers,\u201d in Swan\u2019s words, methodically absorb the float. \u201cThese corporations, they\u2019re long-only buyers. Not traders of Bitcoin,\u201d Swan argues, underscoring the firm\u2019s view that coins migrating into corporate vaults are effectively removed from circulation. The thread portrays three intertwined rotations: Between entities \u2013 Trustees, lawyers and early adopters are exiting; ETFs, corporations and \u201csovereign-grade balance sheets\u201d are stepping in. Between intentions \u2013 Speculation gives way to allocation. \u201cThis new wave of buyers isn\u2019t speculating,\u201d Swan writes. \u201cThey\u2019re allocating.\u201d Between generations. The Silent Generation hoarded gold; Boomers compounded in equities; Gen X surfed tech; now Millennials, \u201centering their peak accumulation years,\u201d are \u201cinheriting trillions\u2014and they\u2019re choosing Bitcoin.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Pauses Below $106K as Analyst Reveals Key Support Level To Watch Supply dynamics, Swan contends, make those rotations irreversible. \u201cWhen long-term capital meets inelastic supply, the float starts vanishing,\u201d the firm warns. \u201cThat\u2019s when things get explosive.\u201d The macro backdrop adds pressure: Swan points to a \u201crare and dangerous split\u201d in which the US dollar is weakening even as bond yields surge\u2014an environment, it says, that could funnel excess capital toward a neutral store of value. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just the next cycle. It\u2019s the end of an era,\u201d Swan concludes. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling now, understand you\u2019re likely handing your Bitcoin to an institution that plans to hold it indefinitely. Once it\u2019s gone, you\u2019re probably never getting it back.\u201d For Swan, the implication is stark. The apparent tranquility near $105,000 is less a sign of exhaustion than the quiet before a permanent liquidity event\u2014one in which the marginal seller disappears, the marginal buyer never sells, and price must eventually mark higher to find equilibrium. \u201cThink twice,\u201d Swan advises would-be profit-takers. \u201cThe float is drying up. The buyers are built different. This is the last Bitcoin rotation.\u201d If the firm is right, history is not repeating so much as culminating, and the market\u2019s current stillness may soon be remembered as the eye of a generational storm.

Upexi purchased 77,879 $SOL, giving it a total of 679,677 $SOL valued at $121M. The company has gained roughly $24.5M from token appreciation so far, aided by a good month, performance-wise, from $SOL itself. &#160; Upexi isn\u2019t the only company looking to capitalize on Solana\u2019s success: SkyBridge Capital, led by Anthony Scaramucci, poured $50M into a Solana Staking ETF in Canada Apollo and Securitize partnered to launch tokenized credit funds on Solana and other blockchains SOL Strategies announced a $500M investment to facilitate SOL token acquisitions and partnerships Classover, an education company, will issue up to $500M in convertible notes to build a SOL treasury That\u2019s a lot of money starting to pour into Solana&#8217;s potential as a financial tool, instead of a simple platform for spamming new meme coins. Of course, degens being what they are, meme coins are still being spammed. A lot of them. A million of them, actually, just in May alone on Solana. Most of those launches fail almost immediately. But the sheer volume of new tokens launched demonstrates continued interest in Solana\u2019s speed and low fees, ideal factors for meme coin success. With a pump.fun token launch likely incoming, it\u2019s not like Solana\u2019s abandoning the meme coin world altogether. Instead, some of the most promising new crypto projects bring both sectors together. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Find 100x Opportunities On Telegram with Snorter Bot With so many tokens launching all the time, the question isn\u2019t \u2018will there be a 100x token.\u2019 The real question is \u2013 how do you find it? That\u2019s where the Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Snorter Bot come in. Tons of Solana meme coins never make it to big CEX listings or major news coverage. Instead, they\u2019re traded on Telegram groups. If they do make it big, the best opportunities for buying low and selling high are long gone. Finding these underground opportunities takes a lot of effort, but thankfully, the Snorter Bot simplifies it all. Safety features like honeypot detection and rugpull alerts help minimize losses, while automated sniping and copy trading let you sniff out and snag the best opportunities. It\u2019s all powered by the $SNORT token, the native utility token for the Snorter Bot. This isn\u2019t a meme coin; it\u2019s a sophisticated trading bot designed to sort through the millions of Solana memes and find the real winners. That utility is driving a wave of interest in $SNORT, with well over $400K raised so far. The presale is in the early days, which makes it the perfect time to buy and stake your $SNORT tokens for an estimated 735% dynamic APY. Buy and stake now, claim your rewards at the token launch, and they\u2019ll be disbursed block-by-block over the next year. A full quarter of the token supply is reserved for product development, powering $SNORT into the future of Solana\u2019s meme coin development. Will the Snorter Bot Bridge the Gap Between Memes and Finance? With millions of dollars flowing into Solana and the $SOL token as a strategic reserve, there\u2019s room for a token that stays true to Solana\u2019s meme coin roots while also looking to the finance future. Do your own research \u2013 you\u2019ll need to decide for yourself. But given Solana\u2019s trajectory, $SNORT could be positioned perfectly. Don\u2019t miss out."
