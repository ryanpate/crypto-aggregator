      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-on-track-for-1-5t-mcap/",
      "summary": "The XRP price is back in the spotlight as fresh projections place the digital asset on a steady path toward a $1.5 trillion Market Capitalization and a 27% crypto market dominance. Notably, analysts remain broadly optimistic about XRP\u2019s long-term outlook, pointing to historical trends, current price movements, and key resistance levels as strong indicators backing this bold prediction. XRP Price Eyes $1.5 Trillion Market Cap And 27% Dominance Despite still experiencing strong consolidation, the XRP price is reportedly on track to capture 27% of the total crypto market dominance and reach a $1.5 trillion market cap. This projection by a prominent market analyst, Egrag Crypto on X (formerly Twitter), has sparked discussions within the XRP community, drawing mixed reactions over the possibility of this ambitious forecast. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target At the heart of this analysis is the notion that the total crypto market cap could eventually expand to a $5.5 trillion valuation, possibly driven by skyrocketing institutional adoption, broader retail participation, regularity clarity, and more. Under such a scenario where XRP is also forecasted to command a 27% market share, its total market cap would equate to roughly $1.485, bringing its projected price close to a historical all-time high of $27. Supporting Egrag Crypto\u2019s optimistic outlook is a historical analysis of XRP dominance levels, particularly focusing on the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement level around the 5.75% mark. The analyst shared a detailed price chart, identifying this key level as a long-standing resistance zone where XRP dominance has been consistently rejected, first in October 2019, then in November 2020, and again in January and March 2025. According to the analyst, repeated testing of this key resistance is likely to trigger a breakout reaction once it is breached. He offered a unique analogy, describing the resistance testing as \u201cknocking on the door\u2014the more you knock, the higher the chances it opens.\u201d Having already knocked on this resistance level four times in the past, XRP is now approaching its fifth attempt. The analyst believes that this could be the moment the \u201cdoor\u201d opens, signaling a potential breakout that could lead to a rise to the projected $1.5 trillion market cap and 27% dominance. Notably, the XRP market cap currently stands at $2.77 billion, meaning it would need to surge by over 54,000% to reach the ambitious $1.5 trillion valuation. In addition, XRP\u2019s present market dominance is around 3.93%\u2014a far cry from the projected 27% market share. This highlights the scale of the growth required, both in value and influence, for XRP to meet the analyst\u2019s forecasted milestones. Bull Flag Set-Up Support Analyst\u2019s Bold Predictions Adding strength to Egrag Crypto\u2019s optimistic market cap and dominance forecast is the emergence of a Bull Flag formation on the macro XRP chart, which historically signals continuation to the upside following a consolidation period.

A successful breakout here could lead the price into a low resistance area marked as the \u201cVOID,\u201d potentially paving the way for rapid gains and a rise to the 27% market dominance.

      "summary": "Over the past few weeks, the Bitcoin price has maintained a somewhat healthy momentum, forging minor swing highs and lows in its bull run revival. Interestingly, this early-week upward movement has been corrected following the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. All in all, the overall positive outlook for the premier cryptocurrency has remained, even though it has been observed to be against historical perspective. An on-chain analyst on social media platform X has delved into this strange phenomenon in the BTC market and the possible reasons behind it. Bitcoin\u2019s Historical Correlations With Macro Instruments In a recent post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost broke down what, until recently, used to be conventional expectations in the Bitcoin market relative to broader macroeconomics. The crypto pundit mentioned that investors consider key indicators when trying to decipher what institutional sentiments and the broader state of global liquidity may be like. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts \u2013 Can Demand Hold? The key indicators investors highlighted in this analysis include the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of major foreign currencies, and the US Treasury Yields, which basically represent the return investors earn on United States government bonds. According to Darkfost, the above chart illustrates a well-known macro principle: when both the DXY and bond yields are on the rise, capital tends to flee risk assets (one of which is Bitcoin). As a result, the premier cryptocurrency becomes susceptible to corrective movements. According to the on-chain analyst, this principle is backed by historical trends, as bear markets in crypto have coincided with strong uptrends in both yields and the DXY. On the other hand, when there is a loss of momentum in DXY and yields, investor appetite tends to shift towards risk. The reason for this, Darkfost explained, could be expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which fuel bullish sentiment across crypto markets. BTC Breaks Conventional Macro Logic In"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-mimic-trumps-57-4m-crypto-income-price-jumps-staking-and-other-rewards/",
      "summary": "Donald Trump has disclosed an income of $57.3M from World Liberty Financial tokens. The president filed his public financial disclosure to the US Office of Government Ethics, declaring that he holds 15.75B $WLFI tokens, the native cryptocurrency of WLF. Interestingly, though, no details were provided as to how this income was generated. Was it through sale or staking, or any other mechanism? We don&#8217;t know. Read to know more about WLF and Trump\u2019s pro-crypto approach. We\u2019ll also suggest the best altcoins you can buy now to rake in a handsome income yourself. Price jumps, staking, we&#8217;ve covered it all. Trump\u2019s Crypto Empire: From Stablecoins to Meme Tokens World Liberty Financial is a decentralized project focusing on open and on-chain infrastructure with special attention to dollar-pegged stablecoins. It has also issued $USD1, a new stablecoin similar to $USDT and $USDC. The project has raised around $550M in token sales so far. It&#8217;s worth noting that the Trump family has a 75% share in the net revenues of this project, with 60% ownership in WLF Holdco LLC through DT Marks DEFI LLC. Overall, the Trump family owns 22.5B out of the total 100B $WLFI token supply. Besides WLFI, Trump had also launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, just before his appointment as the president. It was under him that the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in the US. He also announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve. In addition to being a boon for the crypto industry, Trump has made a decent return from crypto himself. If you want to become an ace crypto player just like him, here are some cryptos worth investing in right now. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) \u2013 Best Altcoin to Buy If You\u2019re Looking for Explode-Worthy Tokens Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best cryptos to buy now, seeing as it&#8217;s leading the DeFi revolution by being the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana. Solana&#8217;s troubles with scalability began soon after the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, two hyper-successful meme coins that flooded the blockchain with new investors. This resulted in periods of sudden spikes in transaction requests, which Solana couldn&#8217;t handle, serving up one failed transaction after another. Solaxy&#8217;s brand-new L2 for Solana will address this by offloading a chunk of the network&#8217;s transactions onto a sidechain. This will reduce the burden on Solana, allowing it to function like the good old days. Additionally, Solaxy has also designed its L2 to process multiple transactions simultaneously. This will reduce the per-transaction cost, further driving up Solana&#8217;s cost-efficiency. Now, here&#8217;s the real kicker: Solaxy is predicted to explode over 11,300% and reach $0.20 by 2030. If you wish to ride Solana&#8217;s newfound vigor and Solaxy&#8217;s promise, buy $SOLX now for just $0.001758. Oh, and the project has in total raised nearly $50M, so you&#8217;ll be buying into the best crypto presale of 2025. But hurry up because the presale ends in less than 2 days. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Revolutionizing Bitcoin with a Layer 2 Solution, Highest Staking Rewards If you&#8217;re looking for a new crypto that can earn you a significant amount of passive income via staking, look no further than Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Currently in presale, $HYPER is offering early investors 613% p.a. as staking rewards. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that this rate is dynamic and will keep decreasing as the presale progresses. So, buy Bitcoin Hyper as early as possible. One token is currently selling for just $0.011875, and besides staking rewards, you&#8217;ll also stand a chance to make around 2,100% in gains. That&#8217;s because $HYPER is predicted to shoot up to $0.253 by 2030. Powered by a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER connects with Bitcoin Layer 1 through a Canonical Bridge. It works by converting L1 $BTC into L2 &#8216;wrapped&#8217; $BTC, which can be used to access decentralized applications, Web3, and gaming dApps, as well as speed up transactions on them. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper wants to breathe new life into the aging Bitcoin blockchain by speeding up transactions, lowering fees, and offering improved DeFi access. 3. Jelly-My-Jelly ($JELLYJELLY) \u2013 Viral Meme Coin Starting Fresh Rally Jelly-My-Jelly is the brainchild of Venmo&#8217;s co-founder, Iqram Magdon-Ismail, and a crypto investor, Sam Lessin. It&#8217;s worth noting that the &#8216;utility&#8217; behind $JELLYJELLY is that it offers token holders early-bird access to an upcoming video-sharing app that will supposedly be the fastest way to post clips from a video chat. However, it has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos, mainly due to hype and backing from the degen community. $JELLYJELLY is up more than 17% over the past seven days \u2013 and a chunky 57% over the past year \u2013 with each token currently available for a low price of $0.02902. Wrapping Up Donald Trump\u2019s massive $57.3M income from World Liberty Financial tokens is undoubtedly a strong signal of crypto&#8217;s bold embrace at the highest level. If you wish to replicate Trump&#8217;s crypto success, look at high-potential tokens like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are subject to market risks. None of the above is financial advice, and you should only invest after doing your own research."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/whales-dump-over-270-million-cardano-in-one-week-bearish-signal-or-shakeout/",
      "summary": "Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating near a critical support zone that could shape the direction of its price action in the coming weeks. After a sharp 15% drop since Wednesday, ADA is showing signs of weakness as broader market sentiment sours amid rising geopolitical tensions. The conflict between Israel and Iran has injected significant volatility and uncertainty into global markets, spilling over into the crypto space. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts \u2013 Can Demand Hold? ADA&#8217;s recent losses reflect this risk-off environment, as investors become more cautious and liquidity thins. The failure to hold above key resistance earlier in the month has turned previous support levels into pressure points for bulls. If ADA fails to defend the current range, further downside into lower support zones could follow quickly. According to on-chain data from Santiment, Cardano whales have offloaded more than 270 million ADA over the past week. This significant distribution adds to the selling pressure and suggests large holders may be anticipating more downside, or at the very least, reducing exposure amid macroeconomic instability. Whale Activity And Macro Risks Weigh On Price Cardano remains one of the most underperforming large-cap altcoins in 2025, currently trading 85% below its yearly highs and 107% off its peak from last year. Despite a few short-lived rallies, ADA has struggled to maintain momentum and attract sustained demand. The broader altcoin market has shown signs of weakness, with capital continuing to concentrate around Bitcoin and Ethereum, leaving ADA vulnerable at key support levels. Analysts are calling for a decisive move as ADA consolidates at a critical price zone that could define the coming weeks of action. If bulls fail to step in, Cardano could see further downside toward historical support levels. The situation is further complicated by global tensions and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Geopolitical instability\u2014most notably the Israel-Iran conflict\u2014has triggered risk-off sentiment across global markets, driving volatility in crypto. Adding to the bearish pressure, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have sold over 270 million ADA in the past week alone. This large-scale distribution from deep-pocketed holders highlights a loss of confidence or, at minimum, a defensive repositioning amid the current uncertainty. For ADA to regain bullish momentum, it must defend current levels and break through resistance with strong volume support. A sustained recovery in broader altcoin sentiment could provide the tailwind ADA needs. However, with external macro risks looming and whale activity suggesting caution, investors should remain vigilant. Unless Cardano can show strength at these key levels, the road to recovery may be longer and more volatile than expected. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Stress As Israel-Iran Conflict Shakes Sentiment \u2013 ETH/BTC Support In Focus Cardano Struggles At Support Amid Broader Market Weakness The daily chart for Cardano shows a concerning technical picture as the token trades at approximately $0.6368, nearing its critical support range. After briefly attempting to break above $0.75 in late May, ADA has since reversed course, printing a series of lower highs and failing to reclaim its key moving averages. Currently, it trades below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages, indicating a bearish structure across multiple timeframes. The $0.63\u2013$0.64 level now stands as a crucial zone. A breakdown below this level could open the door to further downside, potentially revisiting March lows near $0.58 or even the psychological $0.50 level if broader market sentiment continues to deteriorate. The declining volume and failure to hold above key averages signal waning bullish momentum. Adding to the weakness, recent whale activity has raised red flags. On-chain data from Santiment revealed that whales have sold over 270 million ADA in the past week, fueling speculation about a lack of confidence among large holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support \u2013 Can Bulls Defend This Level? To regain strength, ADA must hold current support and break back above the 100-day SMA around $0.70. Until then, Cardano remains vulnerable to further declines as investors grow more risk-averse amid macro uncertainty. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/ripple-to-take-14-of-swift-volume/",
      "summary": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicted that XRP could soon take a chunk of SWIFT\u2019s trading volume. Meanwhile, Circle\u2019s USDC recently launched on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Both developments could provide a huge boost for the XRP price, given the altcoin\u2019s role in the XRPL ecosystem. XRP Price Gets A Boost With Ripple CEO Garlinghouse\u2019s Prediction At the XRPL Apex Conference, Brad Garlinghouse predicted that the XRP could capture 14% of the volume that SWIFT processes by 2030. He noted that SWIFT has two key components: messaging and liquidity. The Ripple CEO added that liquidity is where the power lies and that if XRP drives the liquidity layer, it would gain significantly. This could also spark a surge in the XRP price in the process. Related Reading: Ripple Issues Stern Warning To Investors As CEO Celebrates New XRP Milestone Ripple uses XRP for its payment services, which it runs on the XRPL. In this case, Ripple is betting on taking 14% of SWIFT\u2019s trading volume because of how fast and easy it is to process these cross-border transactions using blockchain technology. This isn\u2019t the case for SWIFT, as the platform focuses more on interbank messaging for these cross-border transfers. In a now-deleted X post, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton commented on this prediction and what it could mean for the XRP price. He stated that SWIFT processes approximately $5 trillion in transactions daily. This means that 14% of SWIFT\u2019s daily market volume equates to $700 billion daily or approximately $175 trillion annually. Deaton failed to give a particular price prediction based on these numbers. However, Fruition, another XRP community member, provided a calculation that could put the XRP price in triple digits. In an X post, they noted that SWIFT moves 150 trillion per year and that 14% of that is 21 trillion. Fruition added that 21 trillion through the XRPL means 58 billion tokens, which equates to $357 for the XRP price. Circle\u2019s USDC Launches On XRPL In an X post, Circle announced that its USDC stablecoin is now available on the XRP Ledger, another development that is bullish for the XRP price. The stablecoin firm noted that XRPL users will now be able to use USDC for DeFi liquidity provisioning, payments, and it could also serve as a settlement option for infrastructure apps. Related Reading: Daily Timeframe Says XRP Price Is On The Verge Of Breakout Crypto analyst Moon Lambo broke down why the USDC launch on XRPL is bullish for the XRP price. He stated that this development will substantially increase the total value locked on the network, which is a major predictor of whether the XRP price will appreciate. The crypto analyst added how this provides additional utility for XRP. He noted that the altcoin will be used to pay gas fees on every USDC transaction on the network. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.15, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
