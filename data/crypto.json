      "summary": "Solana (SOL) has registered a 0.58% loss in the past day, representing a slight price retracement from its strong weekly performance. Notably, the altcoin gained by nearly 10% in the last seven days as general crypto prices surged, pushing its unit price into the $160 price region. Amidst the present market cool-off, Ali Martinez has tipped Solana to embark on a parabolic rally subject to a particular market condition. Related Reading: Why The Solana Price Could Crash To $95 Before Reaching $200 Solana Bulls Eye Breakout As $170 Emerges As Critical Resistance In an X post on July 12, Martinez outlines a bullish technical analysis on the Solana market, stating the altcoin is at a key price juncture. Using the weekly chart, the analyst has been able to identify a mega cup-and-handle pattern, which usually precedes a major price rally. However, the altcoin faces a critical price resistance at the $170 region. For context, the cup-and-handle pattern is a popular bullish chart formation that indicates potential for significant price upswings. As seen in the chart below, it resembles the shape of a teacup, commencing with a bearish market, followed by a price recovery of equal magnitude as seen between the start of 2022 and the start of 2025. During this period, investors saw Solana prices crash from around $250 to a cycle low of $9.88 before experiencing a gradual return to a similar peak, thereby forming the cup pattern. Thereafter, SOL has experienced significant price corrections and rebounds, eventually creating a descending price pattern that represents the handle of this formation. Notably, the cup-and-handle pattern only translates into a price surge following a decisive price breakout above the formation&#8217;s neckline. Following recent gains, Solana finds itself within touching distance of this neckline at the $170 price mark. Martinez explains that a successful weekly close above this major resistance will validate the bullish intentions on Solana, inducing a heavy market demand and paving the path for higher price territories. Based on the Fibonacci retracement and extension levels on the chart, the initial price target in the event of this breakout is set at $295, instantly matching the current all-time high. However, the historical magnitude of breakouts from cup-and-handle pattern points to lofty price targets, such as $ $787, $1,314, and a max target of $2,744. However, a rejection at $170 may force Solana to visit lower support levels near $135 or even $100, which has served as a major demand zone in the past.

      "summary": "Over the last month, Bitcoin ranged within the $100,000 \u2014 $110,000 price region until its recent breakout to reach a new all-time high. On-chain data show that a shift in BTC holder behavior may have played a significant role in the flagship cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent price action. LTHs Begin Distributing, But STHs Accumulate In a July 12 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Boris explained how a shift in Bitcoin holder activity has affected the market over the past months. This explanation was based on indicators measuring the Accumulation Vs Distribution of Long-Term Holders (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH). For these two holder categories, the metric tracks and analyzes wallet behavior to determine whether they are increasing or decreasing their Bitcoin holdings over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes For the long-term holders, the chart above shows how accumulation grew from the later days of May to the end of June. This is represented by the growing green graphs over the red. Within the same timeframe, the chart below shows short-term holders were represented more by the red graphs than the green, indicating more distribution than accumulation in the past month. Boris credited the LTHs for Bitcoin&#8217;s survival above the $100,000 support zone. \u201cDespite heavy STH distribution and retail selling pressure, BTC defended the 100K support \u2014 a clear sign of structural accumulation led by LTH wallets,&#8221; the on-chain analyst said. According to Boris, the short-term holders were observed to have sold more than 563,000 BTC as Bitcoin continued to range. As this happened, the Long-Term holders steadily accumulated Bitcoin, and this absorbed most of the selling pressure from STHs. However, this dynamic seems to have reversed very recently. The online pundit reported that the Long-Term Holders started distributing their Bitcoin holdings. This sell-off from the LTHs may be a result of profit-taking, as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s upward drift would necessitate. On the other hand, the short-term holders have started to accumulate Bitcoin. This trend seen with this reactive group of investors indicates renewed retail interest or speculative entry amidst the current bullish rally. Boris further inferred that this handover from LTH support to STH support must have fuelled Bitcoin&#8217;s latest breakout, as short-term momentum is injected into the market. What&#8217;s Next For Bitcoin? While this rotation of supply between holder classes may not be strange in crypto market cycles, the scale and timing of this switch suggest that Bitcoin&#8217;s price action holds more interesting rallies in the near future. However, if the short-term buying pressure should taper, the absence of long-term support may cause a lower support to be retested. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $117,300, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800\u2014Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap?

Pushing past $4 would mean a 50% jump from current levels and clear the old all\u2011time high of $3.85 set in January 2018. Such a move could come in a fast burst rather than a slow grind, driven by sudden FOMO among buyers chasing new peaks. Ripple Partnerships And ETF Push Ripple has been busy on the partnership front. In early July, the company teamed up with BNY Mellon to custody its RLUSD stablecoin, the 8th\u2011largest stablecoin by market cap, aiming to draw in big institutions. Meanwhile, futures\u2011based XRP ETFs from ProShares and others launched in July, and more than 10 spot\u2011XRP ETF applications are now under SEC review. Any green light on a spot ETF could send demand\u2014and price\u2014higher. XRP Price Prediction According to the latest price prediction, XRP is expected to slip by 0.62% and reach $2.75 by August 12, 2025. Technical indicators still lean bullish, and the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 74 (Greed). Over the last 30 days, XRP posted 18/30 green days with 6.88% price swings, data from CoinCodex shows.

      "summary": "After going on an impressive run to close the week, the Bitcoin price has become relatively steady over this weekend. The premier cryptocurrency has shown some signs of indecision and continued to move sideways within the $117,000 and $118,000 range. According to a prominent online pundit, the Bitcoin price might be at a critical juncture that could decide its future over the next few weeks. Insights from a technical analysis model suggest that the price of BTC might run up to an unprecedented high of $143,000 once it overcomes the next resistance level. BTC Needs To Break This Resistance Level To Continue Rally In a July 12 post on social media platform X, Alphractal founder &#38; CEO Joao Wedson revealed that the Bitcoin price faces significant resistance between $118,900 and $120,000. This price evaluation is based on the Bitcoin Power Law model, which provides a mathematical description of BTC\u2019s historical price trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin SOPR Signals More Gains Ahead Despite New ATH \u2013 Analyst The Bitcoin Power Law model estimates the network effect and adoption curve without speculation. Using this framework, the pricing model provides long-term support and resistance levels or \u201cbands\u201d on the Bitcoin price chart. Wedson revealed that the Power Law model indicates that the Bitcoin price faces significant resistance between the $118,900 and $120,000 region. According to the on-chain analyst, the market needs to breach the Alpha Price \u2014 which lies somewhere around $119,300. For context, the Alpha Price refers to a major inflection point in the Power Law model and a level that the Bitcoin price needs to break and stay above to enter the next significant phase of the bull cycle. In essence, the BTC price must witness a sustained break above $119,300 to continue its rally. Wedson mentioned that the price of BTC will need to show resilience in order to breach the psychological $120,000 level. However, it might need to consolidate first and perhaps take some long traders out of the market before overcoming the $120,000 level, the on-chain analyst noted. According to Wedson, a sustained breach of the $120,000 level will signal the beginning of an even much bigger rally for the market leader. The on-chain analyst put the target for this rally at between $143,000 and $146,000, marking the Bitcoin price top in this cycle. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,530, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by nearly 9% on the weekly timeframe.

      "summary": "Bitcoin is testing uncharted territory after breaking past its previous all-time high of $112,000 last Thursday, igniting a powerful new phase in the bull market. With the price currently hovering above $117,000, bulls are firmly in control as optimism spreads across the crypto market. The breakout comes after weeks of tight consolidation, signaling renewed confidence among investors and traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb \u2013 Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds further support to the bullish narrative. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric\u2014used to assess whether long-term holders are selling\u2014has returned to a relatively low average despite the rise in price. This suggests that experienced holders are not offloading their positions, but instead continuing to hold through the rally. With long-term holders largely inactive and momentum accelerating, Bitcoin appears to be entering a decisive phase. As macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for risk assets, and with institutional demand rising, all eyes are now on how BTC behaves at these new highs\u2014and whether the rest of the crypto market will follow its lead. Bitcoin Prepares For A Massive Surge Bitcoin continues to trade above key psychological and technical levels, signaling that the market is entering an expansion phase with the potential for a massive surge. After clearing its previous all-time high and consolidating around $117,000, Bitcoin&#8217;s structure looks increasingly bullish. Analysts and traders are closely watching on-chain indicators to confirm whether long-term holders are beginning to exit, but so far, the data suggests they are not. Top analyst Darkfost shared relevant insights regarding the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, a key tool used to assess long-term holder activity. CDD calculates how long a Bitcoin stays unmoved before a transfer, revealing long-term participants&#8217; behavior. Recently, the metric saw a sharp spike, raising initial concerns about possible distribution. However, it was later confirmed that the move involved 80,000 BTC in an internal transfer \u2014 no actual selling occurred. Since that event, the CDD has returned to its previous low range, especially when compared to Bitcoin\u2019s soaring price. This signals that long-term holders are still sitting tight, showing no urgency to sell into strength. Their conviction reflects growing expectations of higher prices ahead, supported by macro conditions, increasing adoption, and rising institutional interest. With strong hands holding firm and momentum building, Bitcoin appears poised for continuation. As long as key support levels are maintained and long-term holders remain inactive, the setup favors an explosive move that could redefine price discovery in this cycle.

Thursday\u2019s candle closed firmly above the former record cluster at $109,300, opening the door for a vertical push that carried price to $118,800 on the very next print. The candle body towers well above the 50\u2011period SMA, while the 100\u2011 and 200\u2011period averages slope higher beneath, confirming a bullish long\u2011term structure. The old resistance band between $105,000 and $109,300 now flips into first demand; any orderly retest that wicks into that zone would likely attract sidelined buyers. Below it, $103,600\u2014the mid\u2011range support that capped drawdowns all spring\u2014remains the line in the sand for the current trend.
