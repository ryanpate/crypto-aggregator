      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s daily time-frame has reached a critical point that leaves virtually no margin for error. Price settled last night at $0.17551, clinging to a slender cushion just above the confluence of two of the chart\u2019s most important guide rails: the former down-trend resistance that runs from late February and the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2024\u2019s late advance to $0.48440. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone The structural landscape is defined by a six-month descending channel that has corralled every impulse since Dogecoin topped at $0.48440 on 8 December. The median of that channel\u2014slicing through the field at roughly $0.1800\u2014functioned as durable support until Thursday, when an 11% slide in sympathy with Bitcoin split it cleanly. A failure-retest of a channel mid-line is seldom trivial; until DOGE can reclaim $0.1800 on a closing basis, the chart message remains one of trend continuity. Beneath the market, the black trendline that first rejected rallies on 26 March, 26 April and 2 May reclaimed centre-stage after price vaulted it on 8 May, ran to the channel ceiling at $0.2540, and was twice rebuffed\u2014the first rejection on 11 May, the second on 23 May. The trendline is now retested as support where it intersects the 0.786 Fib at $0.16700, producing a high-stakes cross-point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst If that level fractures, the only historical scaffolding is the multi-year ascending trendline (drawn from May 2021\u2019s all-time high) that merges with a proven demand band spanning $0.14500 to $0.13500. That rectangle arrested the early-April shake-out and would represent the bulls\u2019 final trench; surrendering it would invalidate the long-term series of higher lows and almost certainly inaugurate a broader bear phase with potential gravitational pull back to the January pivot at $0.12990. Oscillators and overlays do little to contradict the bearish drift. The fourteen-day Relative Strength Index sits at 34.70, hovering just above oversold territory but still tracking below its own moving average at 45.22, underscoring persistent negative momentum. Price Targets Overhead, resistance layers are stacked like dominoes. Immediate priority for the bulls is a daily close back above the channel midline at $0.1800; failing that, any attempt at recovery is suspect. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The next ceiling is the compressing exponential moving average cluster: the 20-day EMA at $0.20120, the 50-day at $0.20091, the 100-day at $0.20677 and the 200-day at $0.21550. With all four averages declining and bunched inside a three-cent band, they act as a single reinforced lid near the psychological $0.20 handle. Clearing that barricade would deliver price to the channel\u2019s upper rail, now descending through $0.22. A weekly close outside that boundary would finally neutralise the half-year downtrend and force shorts to cover into the next Fibonacci checkpoints derived from the November high: the 61.8 percent retracement at $0.23484, the 50 percent at $0.28249, the 38.2 percent at $0.33014 and the 23.6 percent at $0.38910. Until then, however, the blunt arithmetic favours the bears. A floor at $0.16700 backed by a multi-touch trendline is slim protection when sentiment is fragile and macro flows are unhelpful. If that shelf cracks, the market\u2019s inertia points toward $0.14500\u2013$0.13500, Dogecoin\u2019s last defensible plateau. Should that red demand zone capitulate, the technical map turns blank down to the January base at $0.12990 and, beyond that into deep bearish territory, especially the August 2024 low at $0.08.

Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a bullish pattern on ETH\u2019s chart, which provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin. Ethereum Eyes $3,300 As Morningstar Candle Pattern Forms In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that Ethereum could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern forms for the largest altcoin by market cap. This came as he highlighted the bullish monthly close for ETH and alluded to the monthly chart printing this bullish pattern. With this, the analyst expects a significant rally from Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH Crypto Bullet noted that Ethereum is now facing tough resistance, but he believes that the $2,500 resistance will be broken. The analyst added that his next target is $3,300. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ash Crypto also provided a bullish analysis for ETH, in which he declared that the Wyckoff accumulation was still in play. He remarked that the first major level to reclaim is $3,100, which will be followed by a small correction. Following that, Ash Crypto is confident that ETH will then surge to $4,000, which will initiate an explosive rally. The analyst affirmed that $10,000 is programmed for ETH in this cycle. As reported, crypto analyst Crypto GEM recently predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,000 by next year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also highlighted $5,000, $7,000, and $8,500 as the targets for ETH\u2019s market structure. Meanwhile, just like Ash Crypto, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is also confident that the altcoin can reach as high as $10,000 in this market cycle. He highlighted a similarity between Ethereum\u2019s current price action and that of the 2017 market cycle. Ongoing V-Shape Recovery For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted an ongoing V-shape recovery for Ethereum. He noted that ETH has kicked off a sharp reversal, forming a classic V-shape structure on the weekly chart. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $7,600 on this run-up.

He shared this on X, renewing a prediction he first made in 2018 when he set his sights on reaching that mark by 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Back then, the crypto market took a sharp downturn in 2022\u2014thanks in part to FTX\u2019s collapse\u2014and the timeline slipped. Still, Draper believes today\u2019s drivers are strong enough to push prices higher. He even suggested that the US dollar might vanish in a decade as Bitcoin takes its place. Tim Draper\u2019s Bold Timeline According to Draper, the $250,000 target isn\u2019t just wishful thinking. In 2018, he said Bitcoin would reach that level by 2022. It didn\u2019t happen\u20142022 saw many digital assets tumble in value. This year, though, he repeated his forecast after seeing a \u201crecent surge\u201d in the crypto. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I\u2019m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: \u2192 General optimism\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy \u2014 Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 He also claimed Bitcoin could become \u201cinfinite against the dollar,\u201d arguing that in 10 years the US dollar wouldn\u2019t exist. His confident tone suggests he\u2019s sticking with the same numbers\u2014$250,000 by December 31, 2025. Political And Regulatory Drivers Based on reports, Draper points to politics as a big catalyst. He highlighted moves by US President Donald Trump, who is working on new trade deals. One sign of this push is the Media &#38; Technology Group\u2019s filing on June 5, 2025, for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. That application is headed to the NYSE Arca, with Crypto.com lined up as custodian, and it aims to bring more mainstream money into Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, the US Senate voted 66\u201332 on May 19 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would set rules for stablecoins. Plus, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 is under debate. It has bipartisan support and is meant to spell out clear rules for crypto. Financial Institutions And Adoption Draper also sees banks and big companies stepping in. He mentioned that JP Morgan plans to let its clients buy Bitcoin and use spot-BTC ETFs\u2014like BlackRock\u2019s IBIT\u2014as collateral. That shift could open doors to a flood of institutional cash. Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy leads the pack, holding over 580,000 BTC. At current prices, that stash is worth about $61 billion. These moves, Draper argues, point to people treating Bitcoin more like gold than a risky token.

      "summary": "The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a significant decline on Thursday, falling over 7% and approaching the $2,400 mark. However, expert analysis suggests that a new bullish trend may soon emerge for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Key Metrics Indicate Accumulation By Larger Investors Market analyst Lark Davis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum&#8217;s potential. He noted that various on-chain metrics and market behaviors indicate an impending breakout for the ETH price. Notably, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter of the year, suggesting growing investor confidence. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved Ethereum\u2019s scalability and reduced its inflation rate, making it more attractive to investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over Additionally, the expert highlights that with exchange balances hitting seven-year lows and substantial inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it appears that larger investors are accumulating ETH for the long term. Despite these bullish indicators, Davis cautioned that not all market participants share this optimistic outlook. Betting markets on Polymarket currently assign only a 27% chance that Ethereum will reach a new all-time high by 2025. Critical Support For Ethereum Amid Political Disputes The broader cryptocurrency market also faced challenges on Thursday, with total market capitalization dropping from $3.30 trillion to approximately $3.12 trillion. Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana (SOL) were among the notable cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, retracing by 3%, 5%, and 6%, respectively. In a separate but related development, tensions between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk have surfaced, adding to the day\u2019s market volatility. Trump expressed disappointment over Musk&#8217;s criticism of a key tax and spending bill from his administration, suggesting that their &#8220;great relationship&#8221; may be nearing its end. Musk retaliated by accusing Trump of ingratitude, claiming his support was instrumental in Trump\u2019s election victory. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 This public dispute has drawn attention to the intersection of US politics and cryptocurrency, a dynamic that market analyst Income Sharks noted in a recent post on Elon Musk\u2019s social media site, X. The analyst remarked on the swift impact of political conflicts on crypto markets, emphasizing that the Ethereum price has not yet lost critical support levels. Income Sharks, in his analysis, identified the $2,390 mark as a crucial support point for the altcoin in the immediate term, which could determine the next upward targets of $3,000 and $4,000. While trading at $2,406 when writing, Ethereum finds itself well below its all-time high reached during the market\u2019s last bullish cycle in 2021. As of now, the altcoin stands 50% below its record of $4,878, according to CoinGecko data. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-cycle-top-in-270000-delayed-until-2026/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s majestic 2024-25 ascent may have stalled at the very moment many traders expected an early-summer melt-up, according to crypto analyst Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX). In an extended thread published today, the Ichimoku-focused technician argues that the market printed a \u201cvalid cycle high\u201d on the weekly chart and has now slipped into neutral territory\u2014potentially postponing the next decisive breakout until mid-July or, failing that, as late as the first quarter of 2026. Bitcoin Bottom Not In? \u201cI warned multiple times that we can\u2019t be bullish on the weekly before the 9th of June,\u201d Dr Cat reminded followers. The Chiko Span (CS) \u201centered the candles\u201d last week, he noted, stripping the weekly timeframe of its bullish bias even though the long-term monthly structure remains intact. \u201cBecause the monthly chart is bullish, things are still long-term bullish,\u201d he conceded, yet the immediate path higher has narrowed to two clear windows. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History\u2019s Turning The first window opens in the week beginning 16 June. If Bitcoin starts that week above $99,881 and closes with CS breaking cleanly above the candle range, Dr Cat believes \u201cthe moonshot, potentially to $270,000,\u201d could ignite. Should price open below that threshold, a textbook CS tracing pattern would already be underway, pushing the next breakout target to the week commencing 14 July (or the one immediately after). \u201cSimply because these are the places where CS can make a clear breakout above the candles terminating a CS tracing,\u201d he explained. Below $93,200\u2014the current position of the weekly Kijun Sen\u2014the bullish countdown is voided. \u201cIf the Kijun Sen at 93.2K is lost, we consider much later breakout,\u201d Dr Cat warned, pointing traders to a broad monthly window between November 2025 and April 2026 when the Kijun Sen itself is expected to slope upward again. Until then, he is \u201cnot confident that the bottom is in,\u201d flagging $97\u201398 K as a short-term confluence zone in which the daily Kumo cloud, the weekly Tenkan Sen and the two-day Kijun Sen intersect. The analysis comes at a delicate moment for sentiment. Bitcoin\u2019s April all-time high above $111,999 has so far resisted several retests, and funding rates on major derivatives venues have eased from euphoric to merely positive. For Dr Cat, such moderation is consistent with Ichimoku\u2019s Kihon Suchi 17-period rhythm: \u201cTime cycles \u2026 give a valid cycle high on the weekly. I think at this point it obviously printed,\u201d he wrote, implying that a fresh consolidation phase is statistically favored. Altcoin Season Even Further Delayed Altcoins face an even steeper uphill battle. In a companion post dissecting the TOTAL3 index (the market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum), Dr Cat argued that \u201caltcoins are not ready to pump on the weekly and need minimum 1-2 months for that in the most bullish scenario.\u201d Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 He cited four overlapping bearish ingredients: price below the weekly Kijun Sen, a negative Tenkan\u2013Kijun cross, a Chiko Span trapped beneath the candle \u201cforest,\u201d and a Kijun Sen poised to turn down next week. \u201cThe chance for a bullish altcoins explosion in June is around 5 %,\u201d he concluded, assigning a roughly equal probability that Bitcoin alone could rally while \u201cdominance destroys alts.\u201d That dour appraisal extends to Ethereum and other large caps. In Dr Cat\u2019s view, \u201cblindness \u2026 applies to anyone expecting a parabolic bull run above ATH in June for TOTAL3.\u201d The first legitimate \u201cwindow of opportunity for altcoin bulls,\u201d he adds, does not open until August, when the weekly CS will encounter a thinner overhang of historic candles. Market implications hinge on whether Bitcoin can defend its higher-timeframe pivots long enough to align with those temporal windows. So far, the $93.200 Kijun Sen serves as the demarcation line between an orderly pause and a deeper retracement. A weekly close beneath it would \u201cactivate\u201d the November-to-April contingency track\u2014effectively pushing any move toward Dr Cat\u2019s headline $270,000 projection into the next halving cycle.
