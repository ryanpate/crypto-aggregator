      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/impending-altcoin-season/",
      "summary": "As Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) rises in the crypto market, analysts are closely watching for signs of the long-awaited altcoin season. In a recent analysis, a crypto market expert shared key insights on the best time to buy altcoins, offering strategic guidance for traders looking to position themselves ahead of the next potential market rally. When To Position For The Altcoin Season As the Bitcoin price continues its upward trajectory, the speculation about an impending altcoin season remains a recurring theme across crypto communities. However, a Bitcoin Dominance chart shared by \u2018Stockmoney Lizards,\u2019 a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), challenges the narrative that an altcoin season is imminent. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Drawing on personal experience and market cycles, Stockmoney Lizards explains that the repeated cries of \u201caltcoin season is here\u201d are often premature and misleading. The analyst revealed that the true altcoin season, the period where even the lowest-quality coins tend to skyrocket, is often the final phase of the crypto bull run. It begins when Bitcoin Dominance breaks below the 60% support level, signaling a market-wide shift into altcoins. Notably, the analyst has shed light on how and when to position ahead of the altcoin season. Instead of buying altcoins based on hype or assumptions of immediate gains, Stockmoney Lizards suggests a more disciplined strategy: accumulate only at extreme oversold levels. This is typically when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour or daily time frame drops below 25-30, reflecting capitulation. According to the market expert, these moments offer the best entry points for short-term rebounds, where altcoins deliver explosive moves of about 50% to 200%. The analyst further highlights that the primary objective is to take profits and rotate them back into Bitcoin. This approach not only maximizes gains but also minimizes exposure to prolonged drawdowns that usually follow the euphoric phase of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Influence On AltSeason According to Stockmoney Lizards, the current behaviour of BTC.D, trading firmly between a well-defined channel, indicates that the market is still in the early to mid-phase of a bull run. Typically, this phase is dominated by Bitcoin, not altcoins, and history shows that institutional capital prefers to build positions in the flagship cryptocurrency before moving to riskier lower-cap assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $200,000 And Ethereum At $10,000? Analyst Says Altcoin Season Is Coming Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s rising dominance in the market is not seen by the analyst as a bearish signal for altcoins in the long term. Instead, it is perceived as a healthy sign of a maturing bull market. He disclosed that the real altcoin season doesn\u2019t begin until BTC.D decisively breaks down from its channel and drops to historical lows. Until then, Bitcoin\u2019s strength reflects institutional accumulation and market confidence. Stockmoney Lizards reveals that retail investors often misinterpret this as a signal to chase altcoins, only to be caught holding bags as BTC continues to outperform. The analyst concludes that the altcoin season breakout will eventually come, but only those who position smartly by letting Bitcoin lead and waiting for alts to reach oversold extremes will be best prepared to capitalize on the market rally.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-still-rangebound-below-2735-level-no-clear-breakout-yet/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is making waves in the crypto market, pushing into key resistance levels following an impressive 14% surge over the past few days. This upward momentum has put bulls firmly in control, igniting optimism among investors as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tests critical thresholds. The recent rally has brought Ethereum close to a pivotal juncture, where breaking through higher levels could confirm sustained bullish momentum and potentially signal the start of a broader uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens \u2013 Tower Top Pattern In Play? Top analyst Daan recently shared an insightful analysis, highlighting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. This consolidation zone has proven to be a battleground, with the price repeatedly testing its boundaries. Notably, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has acted as both support and resistance in recent weeks. The price has also swept both the highs and lows within this range, suggesting a period of indecision that could precede a significant move. For bulls to maintain their dominance, clearing this resistance will be crucial. Failure to do so might invite renewed selling pressure, keeping the market on edge as traders watch for the next catalyst. Ethereum Clears Range Highs But Needs Confirmation Ethereum stands at a decisive level following a robust push into resistance, marking a critical moment for the cryptocurrency\u2019s trajectory. After a notable surge, the price has tested key thresholds, drawing sharp attention from market participants. Sentiment remains deeply divided, with some analysts anticipating a breakout to higher prices, fueled by the recent momentum, while others predict an imminent correction as overextension risks loom. This uncertainty is compounded by global tensions and macroeconomic instability, which continue to drive volatility across financial markets, keeping traders on edge. Daan\u2019s recent analysis provides a detailed perspective, noting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. Within this zone, the price has swept both the highs and lows, reflecting a period of consolidation. Significantly, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has repeatedly served as a psychological and technical barrier. According to Daan, this prolonged range play suggests that a breakout\u2014either upward or downward\u2014is on the horizon, likely triggering a substantial move. However, he cautions that until such a breakout occurs, it\u2019s prudent to avoid overcommitting to either bullish or bearish positions. The analyst points out that over the past few weeks, traders have repeatedly bet on breakouts in both directions, only to face choppy conditions that often result in losses. This pattern of indecision has left many investors \u201cchopped up,\u201d as premature bets fail to materialize. With global economic uncertainties adding pressure, Ethereum\u2019s next move hinges on whether bulls can decisively clear the $2,735 resistance or if bears will capitalize on a potential reversal. Until clarity emerges, the market remains a battleground of competing forces. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds \u2013 Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Price Action Details: Key Levels To Clear Ethereum is trading at $2,690.46 on the 1-day chart, following a period of consolidation after a sharp decline. After finding support near $1,750 in April, ETH formed a tentative ascending triangle pattern, with recent price action testing key moving averages. The 50-day SMA ($2,310.51) and 100-day SMA ($2,077.91) have been breached upward, while the 200-day SMA ($2,657.01) remains a critical resistance, aligning with the current price zone. This move suggests short-term resilience, setting the stage for a potential test of the $2,750 resistance, a level retested four times since early 2025. A decisive daily close above $2,750, supported by rising volume, could pave the way for a push toward $3,000. The chart reveals rising lows since April, indicating accumulation and renewed buyer interest, particularly around the $2,500-$2,600 range. Increasing volume during recent upticks adds credibility to the breakout attempt, reducing the likelihood of a false move. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages \u2013 Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? If ETH holds above $2,500, the trend leans bullish. However, a rejection at $2,750 might drive the price back to the $2,250-$2,400 support zone. The market remains rangebound between $2,475 and $2,735, per analyst Daan\u2019s insights, with a breakout likely to trigger a significant move. All eyes are on whether ETH can clear $2,750 to confirm upward momentum. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "title": "Solana Bounces Back: Bullish Wave Builds Above $155 After Sharp Dip",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-bullish-wave-builds/",
      "summary": "In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Grayhoood observed that Solana (SOL) is currently showing signs of a bullish trend. Over the past 24 hours, the price has climbed by 2.8%, with candlestick charts revealing a noticeable upward trajectory. Solana Stochastics And CCI Signal Short-Term Strength Earlier in the day, SOL briefly dipped to around $151 but managed to recover steadily, reaching a current price of $155.35. Grayhoood pointed out that this short-term strength is consistent with Solana\u2019s 7-day performance, which shows a modest 1.4% increase. However, the longer-term outlook remains volatile, with SOL still down by 3.9% over the past year. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs Grayhoood revealed that technical indicators are suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook for SOL. As price action continues to show signs of recovery, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is likely positioned in a neutral zone, indicating the recent uptick. This positioning allows space for further gains, but also signals a potential shift into overbought territory if SOL\u2019s price surges too rapidly. The Stochastic Oscillator and Commodity Channel Index (CCI) also point to short-term bullish momentum, especially with SOL breaking through the $154 resistance level. These indicators suggest that buyers are regaining control. However, Grayhoood cautioned that while momentum appears to be building, the recent price dip observed earlier in the day reveals that sellers are not entirely out of the picture. Recovery Gains Traction, But Yearly Losses Still Weigh In To further reinforce his claim, the analyst pointed to Solana\u2019s moving averages, which currently present a mixed but insightful technical outlook. In the short term, the 7-day and 14-day moving averages hint at a hold or mild buying pressure. This aligns with SOL\u2019s recent bounce from $151 to $155.35, signaling that momentum may be shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Solana\u2019s Old Hands Are Moving\u2014Is Trouble Brewing? However, when viewed from a broader lens, long-term averages continue to reflect lingering weakness. The 30-day and yearly trends, which show declines of 9.3% and 3.9% respectively, suggest that the larger market remains cautious. These figures reveal that while the recent gains are encouraging, they have not fully reversed the bearish structure seen over the past months. Overall, the analyst believes that despite the volatility seen over the past few weeks, market sentiment is beginning to lean bullish in the short term. Solana\u2019s recent performance, supported by its ability to reclaim key levels and maintain upward momentum, offers a more favorable outlook heading into the near future. If current trends persist and key resistances are successfully challenged, the path may open for a broader shift in sentiment. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-biblical-move-before-crash/",
      "summary": "XRP might be gearing up for a bullish run of epic proportions, accompanied by a similar crash of epic proportions. Particularly, a new technical analysis suggests that the XRP price may be preparing for one of its most explosive moves yet, followed by what the analyst calls a historic crash. This analysis comes amidst a backdrop of XRP reclaiming $2.2 in the past 24 hours, with the next outlook on reclaiming $2.3. Echoes of 2017: Hidden Bullish Divergence Reappears In a detailed breakdown shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst JD (@jaydee_757) drew parallels between the current setup of XRP&#8217;s price action and its 2017\u20132018 market cycle. Back then, XRP printed a hidden bullish divergence (HBD) on the Stochastic RSI indicator, which acted as a powerful signal for an eventual 20x surge. According to the analyst, XRP appears to be repeating the same structural formation, with a new hidden bullish divergence now confirmed once again on the two-week timeframe. Related Reading: Analysts Are Predicting XRP Price To Climb Above $20 In Unexpected Rally As shown in the two-week candlestick timeframe chart below, XRP has already broken out from a multi-year symmetrical triangle dating back to its peak in 2018. This breakout, paired with the hidden bullish divergence, sets the stage for a biblical price move. JD projects an immediate upside continuation once the current smaller triangle consolidation pattern resolves to the upside. This parabolic upside continuation is likely to push XRP toward levels last seen during its all-time high. In this case, the analyst projected a price move above the double-digit threshold, with a target around $17. Post-Rally Warning: 90% Crash Projection Follows However, JD&#8217;s analysis is not without caution. Just as the 2017 rally ended in a dramatic 94% crash from $3.4 to the $0.2 range, the analyst warned that the anticipated surge could lead to a similar fate. This trajectory is illustrated clearly in the chart above. Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Crash Below $2 As Correction Takes Hold, Here\u2019s Why After the anticipated euphoric move upward is complete, JD projects a sharp reversal toward a designated pink box area on the chart. This region, although not labeled with a specific price, lies well below current levels and may cause XRP to crash from double digits to below $1. Unfortunately, the majority of traders and investors could get rekt if they chase XRP near the peak. This follows similar behavior in 2018, where the parabolic rally was followed by an equally violent sell-off that trapped many traders at the top. As of now, XRP continues to coil within its consolidation triangle, and the breakout direction will likely determine the short-term fate of the cryptocurrency. XRP is currently trading at $2.28, up by 2.4% in the past 24 hours. A convincing break above the $3 mark would be necessary to invalidate the resistance of the current smaller triangle consolidation pattern and confirm the start of a parabolic move. Until then, there&#8217;s still a possibility that XRP will be rejected again at the triangle&#8217;s upper trendline. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Chainlink is set to play a major role as Hong Kong\u2019s central bank takes a big step in its digital currency tests. Phase two of the e-HKD pilot will try moving tokenized Hong Kong dollars across borders. The plan is to swap e-HKD for A$DC, an Australian dollar stablecoin. This could cut settlement times from days to seconds. It may also show how central banks can work together with blockchain technology. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Hong Kong And Australia Test Digital Cash According to reports, the project will use Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, or CCIP, to handle transfers. The goal is simple. Move money in real time and make sure both sides get what they expect. Phase two kicks off with Hong Kong authorities and their counterparts in Australia. They will swap e-HKD for A$DC and aim for instant settlement. Based on reports, this setup could serve as a model for other central banks. We\u2019re excited to share that Chainlink is facilitating the secure exchange of a Hong Kong CBDC and an Australian dollar stablecoin as part of an ongoing use case in Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program. Congratulations to participants @Visa, ANZ, China AMC, and Fidelity\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ts2C6Vt4Ul \u2014 Chainlink (@chainlink) June 9, 2025 Chainlink Tools In Use Chainlink is not just a name in the mix. It brings two big pieces of tech to the table. CCIP handles the cross-chain messages, acting like a bridge between different blockchains. The Digital Transfer Agent, or DTA, deals with compliance. It keeps track of who owns what token and makes sure rules in different countries are met. In May, World Liberty Financial tapped Chainlink for cross-chain stablecoin transfers covering USD1. That earlier deal hinted at what\u2019s possible this time around. Big Names Join The Pilot Visa and ANZ are helping with payment processing for e-HKD and A$DC. Asset managers Fidelity International and ChinaAMC will also take part. Their job is to manage the tokenized funds on both sides. This mix of banks, asset managers and tech firms shows the project is more than a small test. It has real money and real risks involved. Reports disclosed that those risks are managed by a Payment-versus-Payment model. This means funds are only released when both sides confirm they have received the other asset. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Market Moves And Reactions LINK, the token for Chainlink, jumped by 6% after news of the pilot broke. It now trades at $14.70. That rise follows a wider market rally driven by hopes that Bitcoin may hit $110,000 before the week\u2019s end. According to market data, crypto traders often chase big targets. Short-term gains can be tempting. But they can also lead to quick sell-offs if the main story fades. Despite the rally, Bitcoin still tracks the equity swings rather closely. There is a mix of bulls and bears in futures data that suggests some people are not yet convinced this run will last. High volatility can shake out weaker hands at the first sign of trouble. A sudden change in risk sentiment or a fresh macro shock can quickly reverse gains.
