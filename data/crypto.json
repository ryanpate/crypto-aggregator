      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-could-hit-73-research-firm-bullish-outlook/",
      "summary": "An extended technical review aired Tuesday on Sistine Research\u2019s YouTube channel has placed XRP at the top of the current market hierarchy and mapped a price trajectory that\u2014if historical analogues and present chart structure hold\u2014could lift the token as high as $73 in a late-cycle blow-off. Speaking during the firm\u2019s regular live-stream, analyst Forrest began by ranking assets that have rallied since the US election on 5 November 2024. \u201cXRP is the number-one performing coin since the election, the strongest coin on my watch-list,\u201d he said, displaying a four-hour relative-performance chart that compared crypto majors, select altcoins, metals and equities. The next-best performers\u2014HBAR and XLM\u2014were described as \u201cbeta\u201d plays that historically accelerate only after XRP begins to trend. Can XRP Reach $73 This Cycle? Forrest\u2019s thesis hinges on what he called a \u201cseven-year flag and breakout\u201d visible on XRP\u2019s monthly time frame. The pattern comprises the long consolidation that followed the 2017 bull market and a second, five-month bull flag carved out this year. \u201cWhy would I not own a chart that looks like this?\u201d he asked, noting the rarity of multi-cycle structures that break decisively to the upside without retracing the move. In his view, the next critical trigger sits above $3.00\u20133.30, where XRP\u2019s prior all-time high was set in January 2018. Once breached, the analyst argues, momentum traders who \u201cfeel like they\u2019ve missed it\u201d will encounter a higher-time-frame market that is in fact just warming up: \u201cAbove three dollars I get even more bullish. The higher this goes, the more bullish it becomes\u2014up to a point, of course.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Eyes $2.50 Decision Zone As Macro Wave Structure Takes Shape Forrest offered a ladder of profit-taking zones: $7\u201310 \u2014 initial resistance where early longs may start trimming. $17\u201337 \u2014 an intermediate band calibrated from Fibonacci extensions and prior percentage moves. $73 \u2014 the \u201cabsolute\u201d target, projected by measuring the full height of the 2017 breakout and extending it from the current flag\u2019s pivot. He acknowledged that the $73 figure \u201csounds crazy\u201d with XRP trading near $2.28 at the time of the stream but argued that similarly outsized moves materialised in past crypto supercycles. During the 2017 run, XRP advanced roughly 1,400% from its breakout flag; applying a comparable ratio to today\u2019s structure yields Forrest\u2019s upper bound. While the tone remained unambiguously bullish, the analyst did outline scenarios that would invalidate the thesis. A decisive breakdown below the present trading range\u2014he cited the $1.80\u20131.90 area\u2014could force a \u201cround-trip\u201d to the mid-$1 zone and delay the upward resolution. For now, however, he sees range-bound price action as constructive: \u201cAs long as we\u2019re holding range, I\u2019m not entertaining the deep retrace.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash \u2013 Here Are The Targets Forrest also distinguished between holding spot XRP\u2014\u201ca no-brainer\u201d\u2014and employing leverage, reminding viewers that structural targets are measured in months and that leveraged positions may not survive interim volatility. Sistine Research\u2019s macro overlay remains resolutely pro-risk through the summer. The firm\u2019s proprietary \u201cBitcoin Blueprint\u201d identified the 7 June\u201321 June window as a historically bullish pocket. That seasonal tailwind, combined with the technical setup, underpins Forrest\u2019s conviction that XRP will continue to outperform not only rival tokens but also traditional safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, which the firm nonetheless holds as portfolio hedges. Whether XRP can emulate its 2017 trajectory will depend on broader liquidity conditions, regulatory milestones in the ongoing SEC litigation, and the extent to which institutional flows diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yet the Sistine Research desk is positioned as though the heavy lifting is already under way: \u201cIt\u2019s slowed down a little recently, but I expect this overall trend to continue.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.32.

      "summary": "Solana (SOL) has surged 6.6% over the past week, raising hopes among holders that the digital asset may be on the cusp of a significant rally &#8211; one that could potentially propel it to new all-time highs (ATH). A combination of strengthening fundamentals and bullish technical signals supports this optimistic outlook. Solana Primed For A Spectacular Summer? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, SOL is currently undergoing a cooling phase on both the spot and futures Bubble Maps. The analyst shared the following chart to highlight this cooling period. For the uninitiated, a bubble map visualizes volume data across exchanges, with each bubble representing trading activity for a specific pair or platform. The size of the bubble indicates the total volume, while the color shows the intensity or change in that volume &#8211; such as cooling (green), neutral (gray), or overheating (red). Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart \u2013 Rally Ahead? At first glance, lower trading volume might seem like fading momentum. However, the CryptoQuant analyst suggests this deceleration could be a strategic accumulation phase, particularly as a potential catalyst looms on the horizon. Many in the crypto community are expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the first Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the coming weeks. In an X post published today, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, said Solana could lead a \u201cpotential altcoin ETF summer.\u201d Meanwhile, predictions platform Polymarket currently places a 91% probability on a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 &#8211; the highest odds recorded since January of this year. Most speculators expect a SOL ETF to go live by July 2025. From a technical standpoint, things are also looking encouraging. In a recent X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that if SOL breaks above the $200 mark, it could kickstart a 5x to 10x bull run. Martinez shared the following SOL weekly chart, which shows the digital asset forming a bullish Cup and Handle pattern. While the \u201ccup\u201d portion has already been completed, the emerging \u201chandle\u201d suggests the potential for significant price appreciation &#8211; possibly pushing SOL beyond $2,000. SOL Showing Promise But Take Caution Despite widespread optimism, some indicators urge caution. On-chain data recently revealed a large movement of dormant SOL coins, which has raised concerns about increased selling pressure in the near term.

      "summary": "Solana is holding firm above the $150 level as bullish momentum builds across the broader crypto market. With both Bitcoin and Ethereum pushing into higher prices, investor sentiment is improving, and altcoins like Solana appear poised to follow once the major players confirm a breakout. After weeks of consolidation and volatility, the stage may be set for a stronger move if current trends hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level \u2013 Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis revealing that SOL has formed a higher low on the chart\u2014a key bullish signal\u2014and is now charging back toward the range highs. This structure indicates growing strength and the potential for Solana to retest and break through key resistance levels if buyers maintain pressure. The $150 zone now acts as a short-term support base, and as long as SOL holds above it, the bullish case remains intact. A confirmed breakout in BTC and ETH could act as the catalyst Solana needs to enter a new phase of upside. With the market leaning bullish and Solana\u2019s technicals aligning, traders are watching closely to see if this move is the beginning of Solana\u2019s next leg higher in the ongoing altcoin cycle. Solana Approaches Resistance As Bulls Regain Momentum Solana is showing renewed strength after spending several days consolidating below the $160 level. With a fresh move upward, SOL is now pushing into key resistance just under $175, a zone that has capped price advances multiple times over the past few months. This renewed momentum comes as the broader crypto market heats up, with Bitcoin and Ethereum breaking higher and dragging sentiment with them. Still, despite the optimism, caution lingers. Most altcoins, including Solana, remain well below their all-time highs. Jelle highlighted a critical development in Solana\u2019s structure: the formation of a higher low. This bullish signal suggests growing buyer confidence and technical strength, as SOL now charges back toward the top of its range. According to Jelle, a breakout above $185 would be the key trigger that opens the door to new all-time highs. While the short-term trend favors the bulls, one key hurdle remains \u2014 flipping the $175\u2013$185 resistance zone into support. This region has consistently rejected upside attempts, and clearing it with strong volume and follow-through is essential for confirming the next leg higher. Until then, Solana remains in a recovery phase. But with improving market conditions and clear signs of accumulation, momentum is shifting. A confirmed breakout could mark the return of \u201cSolana season,\u201d where SOL reclaims leadership among top altcoins. For now, all eyes are on the $185 level \u2014 the line between consolidation and a potential explosive rally toward uncharted territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level \u2013 No Clear Breakout Yet SOL Price Action Details Solana is currently trading at $165.80 on the daily timeframe, showing continued strength after reclaiming the 50-day SMA at $160.99. Price is now approaching the 100-day SMA at $175.70 \u2014 a key level that previously rejected multiple breakout attempts. The recent bounce from the $142\u2013$145 support zone marked a higher low, reinforcing a bullish structure and setting the stage for another attempt to break through resistance. Volume has been rising modestly as price moves higher, suggesting growing interest and momentum among buyers. The crossover between the 50-day and 100-day SMAs would add further confirmation of trend strength, especially if SOL can maintain its current pace and push above $175 with conviction. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds \u2013 Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June A breakout above $175 would likely open the door for a retest of the psychological $190\u2013$200 range, which has acted as a supply zone in recent months.
