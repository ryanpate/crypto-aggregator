      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-monster-rally-amid-brewing-altcoin-season/",
      "summary": "In livestream that stretched beyond the hour\u2011mark, technical analyst Kevin (Kev Capital TA) laid out the most compelling bullish case for Dogecoin since the meme\u2011coin\u2019s April lows. Speaking to a cross\u2011platform audience, Kevin argued that the market is standing \u201cright on the verge of a genuine altcoin season,\u201d and that the textbook double\u2011bottom visible on Dogecoin\u2019s higher\u2011time\u2011frame chart positions the asset for what he called \u201ca monster move\u201d once resistance levels yield. Dogecoin Chart Turns Bullish Kevin began by situating Dogecoin inside a broader macro chessboard. This week\u2019s cascade of inflation data\u2014CPI and PPI prints bracketed by near\u2011continuous Federal Reserve commentary\u2014could inject volatility, he conceded, but the direction of trend is already set by structural forces. \u201cTrueflation is sitting at 1.71 percent,\u201d he noted, adding that the crowdsourced gauge routinely prints about sixty to seventy basis points beneath official Bureau of Labor Statistics data. \u201cAnything under two is good. It means inflation isn\u2019t the story.\u201d Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23\u2014Is It Too Far-Fetched? With macro risks in check, his focus narrowed to USDT dominance, the metric he has used all cycle to time rotations into riskier assets. Tether\u2019s market\u2011share chart has completed a bear\u2011flag breakdown and is now pressing the 0.786 Fibonacci support band at roughly 4.14 percent. \u201cWhen money\u2011flow is deep red on USDT\u2011D, that\u2019s the green light for altcoins,\u201d he said, emphasising that fresh downside in the stablecoin gauge would coincide almost mechanically with upside in DOGE. A hotter\u2011than\u2011expected CPI could deliver a short, counter\u2011trend bounce in USDT\u2011D, \u201cbut the path of least resistance is lower,\u201d he insisted. The anchor for Kevin\u2019s bullish thesis is an unmistakable double\u2011bottom on Dogecoin\u2019s weekly chart that formed exactly on the macro 0.382 retracement of the 2024\u201325 advance and directly atop a multi\u2011year down\u2011trend line. \u201cFlip the chart upside\u2011down,\u201d he told viewers, \u201cand you\u2019d run from it\u2014it looks like a perfect double\u2011top. Flip it back and it\u2019s a gift.\u201d Volume profiles confirm the pattern: sellers exhausted themselves on the second dip, while relative\u2011strength momentum created a higher low, an early signal that bulls are wresting control. Kevin\u2019s conviction draws added weight from what is unfolding in the aggregate altcoin indices. Total 3\u2014market\u2011cap ex\u2011Bitcoin and ex\u2011Ether\u2014has slammed into a resistance \u201cyellow box\u201d that capped rallies all spring, yet the analyst believes the ceiling will crack soon. A pending daily golden cross on Total 2 (market\u2011cap ex\u2011Bitcoin) marks the fourth of the cycle; each prior cross generated a brief pullback of 9\u201119 percent before giving way to fresh highs. \u201cGolden crosses are lagging, so you manage risk here\u2014pay yourself a little\u2014but the trend is higher once the dust settles,\u201d he said. For Dogecoin specifically, Kevin identified a hierarchy of breakout objectives: the local range high at $0.21, the $0.48 pivot from 2024, and the former all\u2011time high near $0.74. Beyond that he flagged extensions at $1.32 and $2.00, noting that targets lose utility if projected too far in advance. \u201cWe analyse the here and now; we let the chart earn the next level,\u201d he cautioned, before reminding newcomers that DOGE is already a ten\u2011bagger off its June 2024 trough\u2014a feat matched by few large\u2011cap tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It\u2019s No Meme While audience questions repeatedly drifted towards Elon Musk and X and Tesla integration rumors, Kevin waved off the cult of personality. \u201cDogecoin doesn\u2019t need Elon,\u201d he said bluntly. The meme\u2011coin\u2019s 10\u00d7 rebound happened \u201cwith zero help from the world\u2019s richest man,\u201d and any future endorsement would likely serve as accelerant rather than spark. What matters, in his view, is liquidity: specifically, the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance\u2011sheet trajectory and the timing of its eventual pivot away from quantitative tightening. \u201cWhen QT ends, Bitcoin dominance tops. Then you get the real alt\u2011season,\u201d he said, pointing to a perfect inverse correlation between Fed asset\u2011runoff periods and historical altcoin booms. Ending the session, the analyst projected that a decisive weekly close above Bitcoin\u2019s 1.886 fib at $120,000\u2014and a simultaneous rollover in USDT dominance\u2014would ignite the next leg. In that scenario, Dogecoin\u2019s double\u2011bottom would evolve into a full trend\u2011reversal, vaulting price into territory last visited during the meme\u2011mania of 2021. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet,\u201d he concluded. \u201cStay calm, stay cool, and let the chart do the work.\u201d At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19126.

      "summary": "Global investment bank TD Cowen has recently revised its price target for Strategy&#8217;s (previously MicroStrategy) stock, MSTR, raising it from $590 to $680 per share and a bullish prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which could soar to $155,000 by December. Possible 53% Drop For Bitcoin The firm\u2019s study outlines a base-case scenario for Bitcoin at $128,000 by year-end, with a more pessimistic outlook placing it as low as $55,000, which could mean a major 53% crash from current prices. TD Cowen analysts assert that a significant increase in Bitcoin prices is expected to positively impact Strategy\u2019s share price, given its status as the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: \u2018XRP Train Has Left The Station \u2013 Analyst On July 14, Strategy purchased an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, averaging $111,827 per coin. This latest acquisition brings the company\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 601,550 BTC. Analysts at TD Cowen noted that what began as a defensive measure to preserve the value of its assets has evolved into a proactive strategy aimed at enhancing shareholder value. Strategy plans to continue acquiring Bitcoin through proceeds from upcoming debt and equity offerings. The firm anticipates that Strategy will raise around $84 billion through its innovative \u201c42/42\u201d plan, which involves an equal mix of debt and equity, potentially increasing its Bitcoin reserves to 900,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Strategy As Strong Investment Option TD Cowen has initiated buy ratings on Strategy\u2019s preferred shares, emphasizing their attractive income potential and price appreciation, which are expected to be less volatile than common shares or Bitcoin itself. This endorsement comes after the firm first recognized Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin strategy in 2023, describing it as a \u201cparadigm shift.\u201d At that time, they highlighted the company&#8217;s approach of utilizing cash from its software business to invest in Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against dollar inflation. Analysts believe that Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply makes it a more reliable store of value compared to traditional currencies or gold, presenting Strategy as an appealing option for investors looking to gain Bitcoin exposure.

The latest report and Strategy\u2019s recent purchase coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high, surpassing $123,000, underscoring the growing acceptance and adoption of BTC in the financial landscape. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency has retraced to $117,000 in an attempt to find its next support level before moving on to uncharted territory once again if buying demand persists among investors.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/investors-chase-snorter-token-as-bonk-solana-market-rally/",
      "summary": "Bonk ($BONK) is on a tear, and it\u2019s not slowing down. The token just extended its gains, building on a massive 20% rally from last week. The reason for all the excitement? Traders are pouring cash into it. The futures Open Interest (OI) for $BONK has shot up to a yearly high, showing a ton of new money is flooding the market. This kind of action is exactly what a rally needs to keep going. However, it\u2019s not just about the trading numbers. The Solana ecosystem itself is doing great. Its launchpad, LetsBonk.fun, is raking in the cash. It\u2019s collected a whopping $7.97M in just one week, completely outshining every other launchpad on Solana. That kind of success makes the overall mood around $BONK super bullish. What\u2019s Next for the Price? The technical charts are looking good too. Bonk recently smashed through a key resistance level of $0.000024 and is now trading above $0.000027. If it can hold at that new level, the price could push on further. Here\u2019s a heads-up for traders: the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a bit high at 76. That\u2019s in the \u2018overbought\u2019 zone, so don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a dip coming. However, don\u2019t let that spook you; the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is still looking strong, with a clear bullish signal. Even if we see a small correction, the overall trend is still pointing up. If it does pull back, look for support around the $0.000024 mark. And while Bonk is having its moment in the sun, it\u2019s also worth noting how the crypto space is evolving. The focus is shifting from simple meme coins to those that offer real utility. This is where a new project like Snorter Token ($SNORT) is getting a ton of buzz. It\u2019s looking to be the next big thing by combining the fun of a meme coin with powerful trading tools. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Meme-Powered Utility Snorter Token ($SNORT) is making a name for itself in the crypto world. Unlike many other meme coins that rely solely on hype, $SNORT is a utility token at its core, powering the Snorter Bot. The Telegram-based trading bot is built to give both new and seasoned traders a serious edge. Its primary appeal is its ability to transform the Telegram app into a high-speed trading terminal. You can snipe hot new tokens as soon as they launch, execute quick swaps, and even copy trades of the top-performing wallets. $SNORT has already raised almost $1.9M in its presale and is offering 205% staking rewards, a clear sign that investors are recognizing its potential as one of the best meme coins. A Powerful Combination of Speed and Security Beyond its low fees and ease of use, the Snorter Bot is also designed with security in mind. The platform boasts an impressive 85% success rate in detecting \u2018honeypot\u2019 and \u2018rug pull\u2019 scams during its beta testing. In a market where new projects can often be high-risk, this built-in protection offers an added layer of security, helping you safeguard your funds and have confidence in one of the best crypto presales. Furthermore, Snorter isn\u2019t just focused on Solana. Its roadmap includes plans to become a multi-chain token. It\u2019s already expanded to Ethereum and has plans to integrate with BNB and Polygon. This strategy will increase its reach and utility, making it a valuable tool for traders across ecosystems. The combination of its fast execution, low fees, scam detection, and cross-chain capabilities makes $SNORT a project that\u2019s not just riding a trend but building a foundation for long-term growth. You can buy $SNORT for $0.0983 in its presale. We predict it could make a high of $1.02 by the end of 2025, and if this is the case, early investors would see a 938% ROI. The Bigger Picture The success of projects like Bonk and the rise of utility tokens like $SNORT are clear indicators of a maturing crypto market. The focus is shifting from speculative assets to tangibility. Snorter Token, with its trading bot and presale success, embodies this direction. It\u2019s an exciting time to be in crypto, but with any investment, it&#8217;s crucial you do your own research and understand the risks before committing funds."

      "title": "XRP Countdown Begins\u2014Analyst Predicts Explosive Run To $11",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-countdown-explosive-run-to-11/",
      "summary": "In his June 14 video analysis, the market commentator CryptoInsightUK argued that XRP is on the verge of a \u201cparabolic expansion\u201d reminiscent of its performance in late 2017, contending that a price of $11 per token is attainable this cycle once Bitcoin finishes its latest impulse leg. The analyst built his case on a blend of historical fractals, liquidity-mapping, and derivatives-market data, concluding that \u201cpeople are under-estimating where XRP is going to go this cycle.\u201d Is $11 XRP Inevitable? CryptoInsightUK opened the session by noting that Bitcoin had just logged the highest weekly close in its history and that the total crypto-asset market capitalisation had set a record: \u201cWe got the highest ever close for total market cap as well now, and I\u2019m looking to see this expansionary period.\u201d With Bitcoin pushing into a \u201cdeep area of liquidity\u201d on the daily chart but not yet reaching the next concentration of sell-side orders, he believes the set-up mirrors the early-November 2024 breakout that preceded a six-day, 31 percent surge. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s done most of its move in the six days following the breakout,\u201d he recalled, overlaying that sequence on today\u2019s structure to infer that a similar window could open imminently. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Signal That Last Time Preceded A 464% Rally, Analyst Says For XRP, the key inflection lies a few cents above the psychological $3 mark. On the 15-minute chart, he observed that \u201cXRP is starting to build some strong liquidity above us\u2026 up to about 3.10,\u201d describing that overhead cluster as potential fuel for a decisive push. Although the token briefly touched $3.03 in intraday trading, repeated attempts have stalled just below resistance. The analyst juxtaposed this behaviour with the way XRP lagged Bitcoin during the 2024 breakout: the coin \u201cstalls out a little bit\u201d while Bitcoin rips, then \u201creally catches up,\u201d moving from roughly $0.70 to $2.70 in nineteen days, before extending to $3.30. Translating that fractal forward, he warned: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be exactly the same, but if it\u2019s six to ten days [for Bitcoin]\u2026 what happens next? Altcoins take over.\u201d He bolstered the thesis with derivatives metrics. During the last XRP rally, a flip from negative to positive contract premium coincided with a sharp rise in open interest. That pattern is repeating: \u201cPremium actually went green\u2026 on an increase in open interest and that is happening again now.\u201d Funding rates remain subdued, implying that shorts still constitute a meaningful share of outstanding positions; as price pressure builds, those shorts could be \u201csqueezed to the downside,\u201d providing what he called \u201creally aggressive price action to the upside\u2026 pretty soon probably for XRP.\u201d In his base case, an explosive move would coincide with Bitcoin reaching roughly $125,000, at which point capital rotation would funnel into XRP and other large-capitalisation altcoins. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals The Two Things That Will Drive XRP Price To All-Time Highs On higher-time-frame charts, the weekly close in the XRP/BTC pair reclaimed levels not seen since early March and printed what the analyst dubbed a \u201clovely green weekly candle,\u201d propelling the pair through the resistance band tracked by trader CredibleCrypto\u2019s so-called \u201cGandalf line.\u201d XRP dominance, he argued, has completed a Wyckoff-style accumulation: the \u201csign of strength\u201d and \u201clast point of support\u201d suggest a new up-leg is underway. Technical momentum is corroborated by a bullish cross forming in the XRP/ETH ratio on the weekly relative-strength index. The analyst conceded that timing remains uncertain and that elevated contract premiums can foreshadow long-side liquidation cascades, yet he maintained that the interplay between resurgent spot buying, rising open interest, and building liquidity clouds above $3 creates a self-reinforcing backdrop for a squeeze higher. \u201cThat is what I expect will come at some point,\u201d he said, framing a breach of the all-time high as a trigger for acceleration toward his $11 objective. At press time, XRP traded at $2.8671. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Coinbase (COIN) is experiencing significant momentum, with its stock poised to reach a record closing high as the cryptocurrency sector enters what the White House has dubbed \u201cCrypto Week.\u201d The positive trend for the crypto industry has been notable since President Donald Trump took office, culminating in Bitcoin (BTC) hitting record highs beyond the $123,000 level on Monday. This surge is attributed to favorable legislative developments, the resolution of ongoing lawsuits with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the appointment of regulators who are seen as supportive of the crypto space. COIN Poised For $100 Billion Market Cap Coinbase has had an impressive start to 2025. Analysts at Ned Davis Research emphasized in a recent note that no other company seems to be benefiting as much from the current political climate as Coinbase. In Monday trading, shares of Coinbase rose by 2% to $394.79, following a record closing high of $388.96 just days earlier. The stock has jumped an impressive 63% this year and is on track to achieve a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion for the first time. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: \u2018XRP Train Has Left The Station \u2013 Analyst A significant turning point for Coinbase came in February when the SEC dropped a lawsuit that had been pending for two years, which accused the company of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. This victory was followed by Coinbase becoming the first cryptocurrency firm to join the S&#38;P 500, further solidifying its status in the market. Investors are particularly optimistic as Congress prepares to discuss three bills aimed at clarifying the regulatory framework surrounding the cryptocurrency sector. The legislation has garnered broad support among crypto advocates. Additionally, the SEC&#8217;s decision to move crypto oversight to its more favorable Cyber &#38; Technology unit and repeal a rule requiring financial institutions to treat crypto custody holdings as liabilities has further boosted market confidence. Positive Long-Term Outlook For Coinbase Looking ahead, analysts from Benchmark Equity Research anticipate that Coinbase will successfully petition the SEC to offer tokenized equities on its platform. CEO Brian Armstrong\u2019s \u201cclose ties to Trump\u201d are expected to play a role in this endeavor. Moreover, Coinbase is well-positioned to benefit from the Clarity Act, one of the bills under consideration, which aims to enhance institutional confidence in digital asset trading and holding. Benchmark has maintained a Buy rating for Coinbase, setting a price target of $421. However, some analysts caution that the positive developments may already be reflected in the stock\u2019s current price.

Owen Lau of Oppenheimer recently assessed the likelihood of the Clarity Act passing at 70% and slightly adjusted his estimates for Coinbase\u2019s trading volume ahead of the company&#8217;s earnings report scheduled for July 31. Even if the upcoming earnings release disappoints, experts believe that the underlying momentum of Coinbase will not be significantly affected. Oppenheimer has reiterated an Outperform rating, raising its price target to $417 from a previous $395. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"
