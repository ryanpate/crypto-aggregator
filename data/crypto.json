      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to retest the local range highs following last week\u2019s market shakeout. However, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency will continue its sideways move for the coming weeks before its next big move. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What\u2019s Next Ethereum Eyes Range High Resistance Last week, Ethereum attempted to reclaim the $2,800 barrier, hitting a three-month high of $2,879. However, the market shakeout, fueled by the Iran-Israel conflict, sent the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to retest its local range\u2019s lows before recovering over the weekend. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $2,400-$2,680 range since the early May market recovery, which saw the King of Altcoins surge from the $1,800 mark toward its current price range for the first time in three months. Nonetheless, it has been rejected from the local range\u2019s resistance four times in the past month. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that Ethereum\u2019s price action has been consolidating between these two key levels, compressing just below the $2,800 area. This level has been a crucial area throughout the cycle, serving as a key support and resistance level since 2024. The trader considers this area to be \u201cthe most important level on this entire chart by far,\u201d detailing that every major retest of this zone has led to either \u201ca nice bounce\u201d or \u201cbig dump.\u201d Meanwhile, ETH \u201cwent on to really even further\u201d after every reclaim of this level as support. Daan explained that its current price range is \u201cbecoming quite a tight range for how long it\u2019s been trading here. You can see how important this is and that there\u2019s likely a big move coming from this point somewhere in the next few weeks.\u201d Based on this, he forecasted that \u201cIf we&#8217;d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K.\u201d However, if it loses this current range, then the $2,100 area \u201cis the big high timeframe level to watch.\u201d Is A 2017 Repeat In The Making? Merlijn The Trader highlighted that Ethereum is now consolidating within its current range after breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could soon experience a massive move. He pointed out that, historically, \u201cthis pause often precedes a surge,\u201d adding that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retesting the recent breakout zone. Additionally, the trader noted that ETH appears to be following its 2016-2017 playbook, with a similar structure to eight years ago. At the time, the cryptocurrency had an \u201cexplosive setup\u201d that led ETH to a massive lift-off starting in 2017. After the market shakeout, the cryptocurrency moved sideways within a tight range while reclaiming the 50-day Moving Average (MA).

Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Ethereum Price On Brink Of Massive Recovery According to Daan Crypto, the current price action for Ethereum shows classical signs of compression. This action is usually recorded when an asset is about to experience a massive spike in volatility, either to the upside or the downside. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum has been trading in a tight range, trapped between two critical levels. If buyers manage to push the price above the first of these levels, sitting at $2,851, then the second crypto by market cap is likely to trend to the upside. ETH price trading on a tight range on the 2 day chart. Source: Daan Crypto via X On the contrary, if sellers regain control over the ETH market, and price dips below its current levels, then the price is more likely to return to the bottom of its current range, sitting at $2,168. Daan Crypto stated the following, warning his followers on taking positions as the Ethereum price consolidates: ETH Price action is compressing right below this big $2.8K level. If we&#8217;d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K. If we do lose this current range then $2.1K is the big high timeframe level to watch. No reason to get over excited in either direction until this current consolidation/compression resolves.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-funds-hit-with-record-outflows-but-altcoin-buyers-smell-opportunity/",
      "summary": "Crypto asset investment products experienced another challenging week as capital outflows continued for a second consecutive period. According to the latest report from CoinShares, a total of $584 million exited crypto-focused investment vehicles, pushing the two-week cumulative outflows to $1.2 billion. This movement coincides with investor uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, which James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, believes is contributing to waning sentiment in the market. Butterfill attributed the investor pullback to growing skepticism about macroeconomic policy shifts, particularly rate reductions. At the same time, exchange-traded product (ETP) activity hit a new low, with global ETP volumes falling to just $6.9 billion, marking the weakest weekly trading volume since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Feast While Retail Flees\u2014ETH Ocean Just Got Hungrier Bitcoin and Ethereum Bear the Brunt of The Crypto Outflows Bitcoin accounted for the majority of this week&#8217;s outflows, with $630 million leaving BTC investment products. Despite the significant movement of funds out of long Bitcoin positions, short Bitcoin products also recorded outflows totaling $1.2 million. This suggests that investors are not currently betting heavily on downside exposure, opting instead to stay on the sidelines amid uncertain market conditions. Ethereum similarly saw negative flow activity, with $58 million in outflows, continuing the trend of cautious investor behavior across major assets. The report also highlighted geographical breakdowns, noting that the United States led all regions with $475 million in outflows, followed by Canada at $109 million. Germany and Hong Kong recorded smaller outflows at $24 million and $19 million, respectively. In contrast, Switzerland and Brazil stood out as exceptions to the broader trend, bringing in net inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million, respectively. This divergence suggests that local factors or institutional strategies in those regions may be driving different investment behaviors. Altcoins Draw Selective Support While sentiment remained bearish for large-cap assets, some altcoins managed to attract capital inflows. Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon saw modest but notable gains of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million, respectively. These inflows may reflect opportunistic positioning by investors seeking exposure to assets that have underperformed recently. Additionally, multi-asset investment products, which spread exposure across various cryptocurrencies, recorded $98 million in inflows. This signals that some investors are using recent price weaknesses to gain diversified access to the market rather than concentrating bets on single tokens. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP? Analyst Says $8 Breakout Is \u2018Just Waiting\u2019 The continued divergence in fund flows highlights the complex sentiment currently influencing crypto markets.
