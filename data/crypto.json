      "summary": "On-chain data shows Tron (TRX) observed a large profit-taking spike earlier in the month. Which type of holder was responsible for the move? Tron SOPR Saw A Huge Spike Earlier In The Month In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has talked about the recent trend in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of Tron. The SOPR refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about whether the TRX investors are moving or selling their coins at a profit or loss. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin being moved to see what price it was last transacted at. Coins that have this cost basis above the current spot price are contributing to loss realization, while those with the opposite setup to profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound The SOPR takes the ratio between the spent value and cost basis, and sums it up for all coins being sold on the blockchain to find a net situation for the market as a whole. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are, on average, realizing a profit through their transactions. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the dominance of loss realization in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the Tron SOPR over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron SOPR saw a huge spike above the 1 mark earlier in the month, implying investors took part in a significant amount of profit-taking. From the chart, it&#8217;s also visible that there were other profit realization spikes during the past year, but the current one stands out for its scale. The latest peak in the metric saw its value go to 4.74, corresponding to a profit margin of 374%. &#8220;With TRX priced at $0.268 at the time, the average acquisition price for those coins would have been around $0.0566,&#8221; explains Maartunn. Interestingly, Tron hasn&#8217;t seen extended periods around this price mark since late 2022, meaning that the tokens would have been held for a good while before being finally transacted this month. Usually, when dormant hands break their silence, it&#8217;s likely to be for selling-related purposes. That said, it&#8217;s not the only reason they may do so. &#8220;The activity could be tied to early investors realizing gains, internal transfers, or reallocation decisions,&#8221; notes the analyst.

      "summary": "Leading crypto exchange Binance witnessed a significant outflow of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on June 23, with investors pulling out over 4,000 BTC and 61,000 ETH in a single day. This shift comes amid easing geopolitical tensions and declining inflation, fuelling speculation about a renewed rally. Bitcoin Likely To Rally As Global Tensions Simmer According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin is likely to resume its upward trajectory, bolstered by a series of recent macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The analyst highlighted multiple positive signals that could propel the top digital asset closer to its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Yearly Trend Suggests Cycle Top Near $205,000 By Year-End, Analyst Says One of the key developments was an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who stated that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between Israel and Iran. This deal removes the immediate threat of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital chokepoint for global oil supply. The ceasefire had an immediate and positive effect on global equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 index surpassing 6,000 for the first time since February 2025. This recovery signals growing investor confidence as geopolitical risks subside. In addition, crude oil prices dropped by 14%, adding to the disinflationary narrative. Lower energy costs help reduce production and transportation expenses, thereby supporting a broader decline in inflationary pressures. Taha concluded: The convergence of significant crypto outflows from Binance, falling oil prices, a bullish breakout in US equities, and the reduction of Middle Eastern tensions presents a striking scenario. With the geopolitical overhang removed, inflation easing, and macro markets stabilizing, Bitcoin is now well-positioned to resume its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales &#8211; wallets holding large amounts of BTC &#8211; appear to be quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout. In another CryptoQuant post, contributor Mignolet noted that whale accumulation has been rising steadily since BTC bottomed in April. Mignolet pointed out that whale activity typically increases during periods of low market attention or heightened fear, often foreshadowing bullish reversals. Historical data supports this trend, showing that increased accumulation often precedes significant price surges. Bullish Quarter For BTC In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that BTC is set to close a bullish monthly candle, reinforcing the long-term uptrend for the flagship cryptocurrency. Several other on-chain and technical indicators also suggest further upside potential. For example, Bitcoin Binary CDD shows that long-term holders are continuing to hold rather than sell, indicating strong conviction in BTC\u2019s long-term value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern \u2013 Is $150,000 The Next Target? At the same time, the number of short positions is climbing as BTC consolidates between $100,000 and $110,000. This dynamic raises the probability of a short squeeze, potentially propelling Bitcoin to a new ATH. At press time, BTC trades at $105,408, up 5.2% in the past 24 hours.
