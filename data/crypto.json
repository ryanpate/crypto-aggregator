      "summary": "According to Digital Ascension Group\u2019s Managing Director Jake Claver, XRP could reach a price level that brings a dramatic shift in how value moves on its network. He argues that higher token prices make the system more efficient. Claver even lays out a bold target of $10,000 per XRP, and he says that can happen within 24 months. The idea has reignited talk of crypto\u2019s next big rally. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Price And Liquidity Efficiency According to Claver, moving large sums on the XRP ledger depends on token price. At $1 per XRP, you need 1,000,000 tokens to shift $1 million. If the price rose to $10, only 100,000 tokens would do the job. And in a world where one XRP costs $1 million, a single token could cover that same $1 million transfer. This math shows why Claver believes price and network efficiency go hand in hand. Does XRP need to be a certain price to move large amounts of money? pic.twitter.com/tbqBbvST4y \u2014 Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 27, 2025 Market Cap Implications XRP trades near $2.24 today, with a market cap of about $131.7 billion. At $10,000 per token, that cap would swell to over $585 trillion. Claver treats that huge number as a sign of strength rather than a warning. He says market cap rules don\u2019t apply the same way to XRP. But critics point out you can\u2019t assume that every token sits ready to trade. Actual liquidity comes from orders on exchanges and funds in liquidity pools, not just a headline market cap. Timeline And Skepticism Claver doesn\u2019t shy away from timing. He told his followers that the $10,000 mark could arrive within 24 months. Some hear that as a call to buy now. Others see it as wildly optimistic. To reach that level, XRP would need to climb more than 500,000% from today\u2019s price. Even Bitcoin, with far more adoption, took about four years to go from $1,200 to $68,000 in the last cycle. Cranking out a similar or bigger gain in half the time would require huge new demand. Community Reaction And Risks Based on reports, Claver\u2019s claim has attracted both cheers and jeers. Some XRP fans embrace the vision. Others worry it sets unrealistic hopes. Alex Caraco, former CEO of an Australian stock market firm, summed up a common view: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see buyers sold the story of $10,000 XRP happening tomorrow.\u201d Critics say such talk distracts from real issues like regulatory hurdles, exchange listings and developer growth.

Current indicators paint a neutral market mood, with the Fear &#38; Greed Index leaning heavily toward Neutral at a score of 57.

      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s Market-Value-to-Realised-Value (MVRV) Z-Score is printing just 0.28 \u2013 a level normally associated with capitulation, not euphoria. Yet the price of the ninth-largest cryptocurrency keeps carving a succession of higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart, trading near $0.17 with a market capitalisation of roughly $26 billion in Monday\u2019s late-New-York session. The juxtaposition between lethargic on-chain sentiment and resilient spot bids was laid bare in a chart posted to X by Kevin, the pseudonymous analyst behind @Kev_Capital_TA. \u201cDogecoin MVRV Score is still at bear-market levels while price continues to make higher highs and higher lows on higher time frames,\u201d he wrote. Kevin also pointed out that previous cycle tops saw the Z-Score blow off at \u224811 in 2017 and \u224816 in 2021, whereas the current advance has so far peaked at 3.5. \u201c#DOGE \u2026 has not seen a real bull run yet. This delay in durable Altcoins out-performance is very much due to restrictive monetary policy\u2026 It will change at some point and Alts will have their day in the sun.\u201d The Macro Backdrop For Dogecoin The \u201crestrictive monetary policy\u201d Kevin cites remains the single most important head-wind for the entire alt-coin complex. In the US, the Federal Reserve has held the fed-funds target at 4.25 %\u20134.50% since January, having already delivered three cuts in 2024. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level\u2014Or Risk A 30% Price Crash Futures markets this week imply the first additional reduction \u201caround September or later,\u201dafter soft May inflation but a still-solid economy At the same time the Fed is only slowing \u2014 not stopping \u2014 quantitative tightening: beginning 1 April the monthly Treasury run-off cap fell to $5 billion from $25 billion, but Chair Jerome Powell made clear \u201cthere is no sign yet the Fed is ready to end QT.\u201d In Europe, the ECB has started to nudge borrowing costs lower, slicing the deposit rate to 2% on 5 June. President Christine Lagarde nevertheless insisted the Governing Council was \u201cin a good position\u201d to move gradually and would keep quantitative easing \u201cin the toolbox,\u201d rather than redeploying it. Vice-President Luis de Guindos was more explicit yesterday, telling Reuters that the ECB had \u201clearned much more about side effects\u201d of money printing and that the bar for new QE is now \u201chigher.\u201d The net result is a world in which policy rates are still comfortably above neutral, liquidity is being drained by the Fed, and European officials are determined not to repeat the 2015-21 experiment of perpetual bond-buying. In Kevin\u2019s words, this \u201cdelay\u201d in easy money explains why alt-coins have under-performed Bitcoin so far in the 2024-25 cycle. Reading The MVRV Tea Leaves MVRV compares the aggregate market value of all coins with the value at which they last moved on-chain (their realised value). A Z-Score normalises that ratio against its own multi-year mean and standard deviation. Historically for Dogecoin, values above +9 have coincided with secular tops (January 2018; May 2021), values between \u20131 and +1 have appeared during long lateral \u201ccrypto winters,\u201d and values below \u20131 have signalled deep capitulation and, in hindsight, exceptional long-term entry points. Related Reading: $8 Dogecoin? Analyst Says You\u2019ll Regret Sleeping On This Chart Today\u2019s 0.28 sits squarely inside the winter band even though spot DOGE is up roughly 5x from its 2022 lows. The same disparity is visible within the chart: the blue line (market cap) has been rising since late 2023, while the red Z-Score remains pinned near zero because the orange line (realised cap) is climbing almost in lock-step as dormant supply changes hands at higher cost basis. In plain English, the average on-chain holder is not yet sitting on the kind of paper profits that breed euphoria. When Could Policy Turn From Restrictive To Supportive? Futures markets now look for two quarter-point Fed cuts by December, taking policy to roughly 3.75%. Market-implied odds of a September move fluctuate with each inflation print; should shelter and services dis-inflation stall, traders will push expectations into 2026. However, neither the Fed nor the ECB is openly contemplating new asset purchases. Powell told reporters in March that the slower pace of QT is designed to \u201cextend how far the central bank can run QT before needing to stop,\u201d not to hint at a reversal. In Frankfurt, de Guindos stressed that \u201csometimes it\u2019s much easier to start using [QE] than to withdraw it,\u201d signalling that any relaunch would require either a financial-stability shock or a deep recession. With QT still active and rate-cut trajectories shallow, a powerful systemic tail-wind for DOGE may not materialise until after the first Fed or ECB pause in balance-sheet contraction. If consensus is correct that QT ends late-2025 or early-2026, any prospective QE would be a story for the next downturn, not this upswing. Kevin\u2019s interpretation hinges on potential energy. Because the Z-Score has not yet detached from its mean, Dogecoin can, in theory, absorb a fresh wave of retail and leverage-driven inflows without immediately flashing the kind of overheated signal that coaxed sellers in 2017 and 2021. Put differently, DOGE\u2019s spring has not been compressed. Macro, however, remains the gating factor. \u201cBuy them low and sell them high. Never get attached to your Alts,\u201d the analyst reminds followers. For now, low MVRV suggests structural downside is limited, but cyclicality implies explosive upside will likely coincide with a convincing turn in global liquidity \u2013 a turn that the Fed and the ECB, by their own admission, are not yet ready to deliver. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17387. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "As Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market show tentative signs of recovery following the most recent correction, a crypto analyst has made a bold statement suggesting that the market may have already reached its peak. BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space. Crypto Pump Or Trap? In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that \u201ccrypto has already PEAKED\u201d and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a \u201cslow-motion downtrend,\u201d with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gold Rush 2.0? Treasuries Swell With 60 New Players The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or \u201cgreen candles\u201d are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows\u2014such as fresh stimulus or significant investment\u2014the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak? Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso\u2019s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-slowns-down-june/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is already seeing a slowdown for the month of June, suggesting that it is sticking to established historical trends for the month. With half of the month already gone, the altcoin is likely to finish out the month in the same trend, and the previous cycle data warns of further price crashes. But how far down will the Ethereum price go before it recovers? Ethereum Fighting The Bears In June According to data from the CryptoRank website, the month of June is the second-worst month for the Ethereum price historically. This comes down to its average and median returns, which sit at -6.56% and -5.65%, respectively, showing that returns for the month are likely to be red. It falls behind only the month of September, which has -10.7% average returns and -13.6% median returns. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Explodes 3,194%: Can It Change The SHIB Price Trajectory? In the decade that the Ethereum cryptocurrency has existed, only a total of three years have the month of June ended in green. In contrast, six years have closed in the red, including back in 2024 when the Ethereum price tumbled 8.64% in June. So far, the month of June 2025 has seen very little gains, with CryptoRank data only showing a 0.20% increase at the time of writing. This suggests a continuation of the established bearish trend, especially with the bear still pushing down the price of Bitcoin, and the rest of the crypto market keeps going down with it. If the altcoin does stick to its historical performance, then it is possible that the price could break below $2,500 before the month is over. However, there is still the possibility of a recovery if the Bitcoin price does continue to rise. Bullish Sentiment Still Strong Despite the bearish trend of June, crypto analysts are still calling for higher prices for Ethereum. One analyst, Crypto Patel, predicts a possible short-term crash if the Ethereum price drops below $2,500. Patel believes $2,000 is next if this happens. However, long-term remains bullish as the crypto analyst believes Ethereum is headed for $10,000.

Crypto analyst Lord of Alts also explained that Ethereum is actually playing out as expected, with three trends. The first is consolidation, then accumulation, before ending in a price expansion. Lord of Alts says ETH is entering this trend again and puts the price as high as $6,000 by 2026. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the exchange inflows related to the stablecoins USDT and USDC have seen a sharp plunge. Here&#8217;s what this could mean for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Have Dropped Below Yearly Average In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the latest trend in the Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins in the sector, USDT and USDC. The &#8220;Exchange Inflow&#8221; refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that&#8217;s moving into the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Generally, investors may deposit their coins into these platforms when they want to trade them away, so a high value on the Exchange Inflow can indicate demand for swapping the cryptocurrency. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally be bearish for the price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level\u2014Or Risk A 30% Price Crash In the case of stablecoins, however, their price doesn&#8217;t see any impact from exchange deposits, since it always remains, by definition, stable around whatever fiat currency the asset is tracking. That said, stablecoin inflows aren&#8217;t without consequence. Investors usually deposit these assets to swap into a volatile cryptocurrency of their choice. As such, coins like Bitcoin can see a bullish effect from an Exchange Inflow spike related to these fiat-tied tokens. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Inflow of USDT and USDC shot up to a very high value at the end of last year, a sign that the investors were making massive deposits of these stablecoins. Alongside the spike in the indicator, the Bitcoin price observed a rally to a new all-time high (ATH), a potential sign that the stablecoin inflows may have helped provide the fuel for the run. At the peak of the spike, the metric reached a value of $131 billion per day. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that since then, the indicator has been following a downward trajectory and today, its value has come down to $70 billion per day. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls This represents a significant decline of $61 billion since the high. Though, while the indicator is indeed notably down compared to the peak, its current level is still high in the context of the wider cycle so far. Naturally, if this drawdown in the stablecoin Exchange Inflow keeps up, it could potentially turn out to be a bearish sign for Bitcoin and other digital assets. That said, even though BTC went down earlier in the year, its price is still above the $100,000 mark right now, a possible sign that investors may simply be entering a phase of consolidation. Bitcoin Price Following a surge of about 2.5% over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has managed to recover back to the $108,100 level.
