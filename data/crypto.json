      "summary": "A federal judge has rejected Ripple and the SEC&#8217;s proposed $50 million settlement, but social media sentiment around XRP has turned bullish anyway. Ripple-SEC Settlement Stalled After Court Rejection The Ripple-SEC case seemed to be moving forward after both parties agreed on a reduced $50 million settlement, but the joint motion for an indicative ruling has now been rejected in court. According to the filing shared by defense lawyer James K. Filian in an X post, the two haven&#8217;t &#8220;come close&#8221; to showing exceptional circumstances outweighing public interest or the administration of justice that would justify modifying the judgment. This means that the original fine of $125 million still stands for Ripple. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Shoots Up: Warning For BTC? Following the news, XRP has taken a bearish hit to its price, as the below chart displays. The asset was trading around $2.15 at the time the news broke out, but it has since fallen below $2.09, implying a decrease of around 3%. Naturally, this reaction is quite mild by the cryptocurrency sector&#8217;s standards, but could still suggest some panic selling. Sentiment among the retail crowd, however, has seen a surprising jump, as per social media data. XRP Sentiment On Social Media Has Seen A Bullish Jump In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the social media users have responded to news of the Ripple-SEC case stalling. The indicator shared by Santiment is the &#8220;Positive/Negative Sentiment,&#8221; gauging the ratio between positive and negative comments involving a given coin on the major social media platforms. The indicator separates between positive and negative posts/threads/messages on the platforms using a machine-learning model and determines how the counts of the two compare. Here is a chart that shows the latest trend in the metric for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP: As displayed in the above graph, the Positive/Negative Sentiment is currently above the 1 mark for all three of these cryptocurrencies, indicating that posts pertaining to bullish sentiment outweigh the bearish ones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction For Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, the positive comments only have a slight advantage, meaning that while optimism does exist among the crowd, it&#8217;s quite mild. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that XRP has diverged from these assets with a sharp spike, which has taken its Positive/Negative Sentiment to a value of 2.1. This is the highest level for the cryptocurrency in 17 days and corresponds to there being more than double as many bullish calls as bearish ones. Often, retail sentiment acts as a contrarian signal, with extreme values in either direction leading to some sort of reversal in the price. As such, while this development in crowd mentality could potentially imply investors aren&#8217;t worried about the news, the indicator could still be to keep an eye on.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-time-bomb-hidden-bullish-weekly-chart/",
      "summary": "In a post on 27 June, crypto-market chartist Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) warned that Bitcoin\u2019s ostensibly bullish weekly structure may be concealing a latent \u201ctime bomb\u201d that could detonate if bulls fail to force a decisive breakout over the next three to four weeks. The technician\u2019s diagnosis hinges on a classic Ichimoku paradox: an expanding bullish kumo and a flat Kijun Sen on the weekly timeframe are clustering with a constellation of bearish warnings on the daily and two-day charts. Bitcoin Faces A July Time Bomb \u201cLook at the weekly kumo: it\u2019s expanding, widening,\u201d Dr Cat began. \u201cThis means that bullish momentum is building for potential trend sustainability even though the trend is not active as Kijun Sen is flat.\u201d The observation is significant because an enlarging kumo\u2014formed by the Senkou Span A/B envelope\u2014generally represents thickening support, making sudden breakdowns statistically less probable as long as the cloud keeps widening. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer At the same time, the Chikou Span (CS) is \u201cabove the candles without a gap,\u201d but, Dr Cat cautioned, it has \u201c4 weeks deadline to close above ATH or will enter the candles.\u201d Should the lagging line be absorbed back into price, the textbook interpretation is a loss of bullish conviction at the largest visible scale. That ostensibly constructive weekly backdrop contrasts starkly with a \u201clot of red flags on the daily hinting for a bearish scenario which can escalate on many levels.\u201d Among those alarms is the prospect of a death TK cross on the two-day chart, anticipated \u201ctonight,\u201d in which the Tenkan Sen slips below the Kijun Sen\u2014often the prelude to a down-leg when it materialises beneath the cloud. \u201cSo how do you interpret such conflicting information from different timeframes?\u201d the analyst asked rhetorically, underscoring that traders who privilege only a single interval risk being blindsided. Dr Cat\u2019s answer is a roadmap defined by time. Because the weekly cloud continues expanding, \u201cit is hard for the price to dump a lot\u201d immediately; historically, the kumo \u201cneeds first to become flat.\u201d The flattening mechanism is mechanical: if Bitcoin fails to record a fresh all-time high \u201cin 2 weeks from now,\u201d roughly by the week that begins 14 July, the leading Senkou Span A numerator will stop rising, truncating cloud expansion. That in turn opens a window for gravity to reassert itself on the higher timeframe. Against that backdrop the analyst offered two conditional trajectories. First scenario: bearish signals on the lower charts mature. \u201cThe price will likely need at least 1.5 month or so for a very big dump on the weekly scale, because the weekly kumo will keep expanding for 2 more weeks,\u201d Dr Cat wrote. During that holding period the market could \u201crange around / just do small dumps to the $90s,\u201d a reference to the high&#8211;$90 000 zone that has defined range lows since late spring. Should this grind continue beyond the second half of July without a structural shift on daily Ichimoku metrics, weekly momentum would invert: the kumo would cease expanding and the CS would dive into prior candles, removing two of the most durable layers of longer-term support. Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts New Bitcoin Peak Timeline And \u2018Double Cycle Blowoff\u2019 Second scenario: bulls seize the initiative. To \u201csave the chart from the warning signs,\u201d buyers must engineer \u201ca higher high above the $110,600 high shortly after the 27th of June,\u201d thereby invalidating the bearish daily setup and re-energising the top-down trend. Time is critical: after \u201cthe week starting on 14th of July,\u201d the CS will approach prior candlesticks, making each subsequent failure to print a new high proportionally more damaging. Dr Cat locates a final decision node on \u201cthe Sunday of the week starting on the 14th of July\u201d\u201420 July\u2014when the interplay between a stalling cloud and an in-candle CS could arm an additional set of \u201cred flags for bulls.\u201d"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-go-below-99000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin returned to its familiar price range over the week after a dip last weekend brought its price to just under $99,000. This was followed by a bounce to the $106,000 price level, which has given bulls a reason to remain hopeful. However, on-chain data shows some deeper cracks are forming beneath the surface. The latest on-chain data from analytics firm Glassnode shows growing signs of fatigue in both spot and futures markets. These are conditions that may again cause Bitcoin price to retest $99,000. Price Support Holds, But Momentum is Clearly Fading Bitcoin has gone through multiple price swings in recent days, but it has found its way back to the narrow $100,000 to $110,000 band that has defined market structure since early May. On-chain data from Glassnode shows that strong accumulation between $93,000 and $100,000, which is visible on the Cumulative Volume Delta (CBD) Heatmap, has so far served as a buffer zone that helped Bitcoin&#8217;s prices bounce during the most recent geopolitical volatility. However, market volume indicates that this structural support may soon face additional pressure. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer According to the latest weekly report by Glassnode, investor profitability and engagement surrounding Bitcoin are cooling rapidly. Specifically, a third major wave of profit-taking is causing the 30-day realized profit average to taper, and on-chain activity has decreased significantly. The 7-day moving average of on-chain transfer volume has dropped by about 32%, from a peak of $76 billion in late May to $52 billion over the recent weekend. Current spot volume trading, which is now at just $7.7 billion, is far below the volumes seen during previous rallies. The lack of strong buying enthusiasm on the spot market shows that bullish sentiment has been replaced by caution. As such, the risk of a breakdown below $99,000 grows unless another wave of demand re-enters. Futures Market Also Cooling Off The slowdown in sentiment is not limited to the spot market. Although Bitcoin is attracting interest on derivatives exchanges, there are clear signs that futures sentiment is waning. Open interest dropped by 7% over the weekend, from 360,000 BTC to 334,000 BTC, and funding rates have been declining steadily since Bitcoin hit its Q1 2025 all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align Futures market participants had been very active through Bitcoin\u2019s climb to $111,800 in May, but their conviction appears to be fading now. A further indication of a growing reluctance to hold long positions is the sharp decline in both the annualized funding rate and the 3-month rolling basis. Without stronger directional conviction, the futures markets may not provide the upside needed to push Bitcoin to new highs. This situation may instead contribute to additional downward pressure. So far, Bitcoin has respected the $93,000 to $100,000 support zone, which was heavily accumulated during the Q1 2025 top formation. However, with low spot volumes, on-chain activity slowing, and fading futures sentiment, this support could become tested again. If market participants with a cost basis in this zone begin to sell, the resulting pressure could drag Bitcoin below $99,000 again next week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,100.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-forms-4-year-inverse-hs-pattern-neckline-break-could-send-it-parabolic/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is showing resilience above the $105,000 mark, holding firm despite ongoing volatility and economic uncertainty. While bulls struggle to break above the all-time high at $112,000, the market remains in a high-stakes consolidation phase. Macroeconomic conditions remain unstable, with weak global growth forecasts and elevated inflation pushing investors into risk-off assets. Still, Bitcoin appears to be thriving under these pressures, strengthening its case as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears \u2013 Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently highlighted a compelling technical development: Bitcoin is forming a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern spanning the last four years. This rare and long-term formation typically signals a bullish reversal and, if confirmed, could mark the beginning of a powerful breakout into price discovery. Runefelt notes that the neckline of this pattern aligns with current resistance just below $112K, making the coming weeks crucial for market direction. As the crypto market digests geopolitical tensions, central bank policy shifts, and on-chain accumulation trends, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to stay elevated signals growing investor conviction. All eyes are now on whether BTC can complete this historic pattern and launch the next leg of the bull run. Bitcoin At A Critical Crossroads Bitcoin is trading at a pivotal level that could determine the market\u2019s next major move \u2014 a breakout into new all-time highs or a retrace toward lower demand zones. After surging over 10% since last Sunday, the bullish sentiment is building rapidly, but the price remains stuck in a tight range between $100,000 and $110,000. Bulls are confident and in control of momentum, yet they\u2019ve repeatedly failed to push BTC above the key $110K resistance. At the same time, bears have been unable to take the price below the $100K psychological support, signaling equilibrium and mounting pressure for a breakout. This standoff has kept volatility high, with macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical instability adding fuel to the fire. Still, the current market structure appears constructive for Bitcoin. If bulls can finally break above the $110K level and push into price discovery, it would confirm the strength behind this rally and potentially spark a new phase of exponential growth. Carl Runefelt believes a major breakout may be on the horizon. His technical analysis reveals a massive inverse head and shoulders pattern forming over the last four years \u2014 a rare and highly bullish setup. According to Runefelt, traders should be \u201cready for a crazy pump\u201d if Bitcoin breaks through the neckline near $112K. Historically, this type of pattern precedes explosive rallies, and given the long-term nature of this one, the upside potential could be significant. As long-term holders accumulate and market liquidity builds, the coming weeks may determine whether Bitcoin cements its breakout or returns to test deeper support. Either way, this moment is shaping up to be one of the most decisive junctures in the current bull cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level \u2013 Bullish Continuation In Focus BTC Price Analysis: Key Resistance Blocks Price Discovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,144 on the daily chart, showing modest gains but facing strong resistance as it nears the $109,300 level. The chart highlights a clearly defined horizontal structure between $103,600 and $109,300 \u2014 a range Bitcoin has respected for nearly two months. Bulls remain in control short term, having reclaimed all three major moving averages: the 50-day ($105,800), 100-day ($96,784), and 200-day ($96,136) SMAs. The most recent bounce off the $103,600 support zone was followed by rising volume, indicating a potential shift in momentum back to the upside. However, BTC has yet to close convincingly above $109,300, which continues to cap any price discovery attempts. A breakout above this level could open the door to new all-time highs and trigger an aggressive bullish continuation. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure \u2013 Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25\u2013$30 Surge On the downside, failure to breach resistance and a drop below $105K could reintroduce bearish pressure and trigger a retest of the lower range. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound with bullish bias, but buyers need to follow through with strong volume and a clean break above the $109K barrier to fully confirm market intent. Until then, caution is warranted as indecision prevails near key resistance. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/chainlink-link-on-standby/",
      "summary": "Chainlink (LINK) ended its latest session in a holding pattern, with indecisive candles and choppy intraday action pointing to a lack of clear direction. Traders now look to Bitcoin\u2019s next move for guidance; any meaningful shift in BTC dominance could quickly tilt LINK\u2019s price action. Until the market leader shows its hand, LINK remains on standby, hovering near key support while waiting for a decisive cue. Falling Wedge Holds The Key To Chainlink Next Big Move In a recent X post, CRYPTOWZRD provided an update on Chainlink&#8217;s daily technical outlook, noting that the daily candles for both LINK and LINKBTC closed indecisively. This indecision reflects uncertainty in the market as traders await clearer direction. The lack of a strong trend suggests a pause before the next significant move. Related Reading: Chainlink Bears Push Toward $12.50 As Weekend Volatility Looms The analyst highlighted that LINKBTC is currently forming a falling wedge pattern, which is generally considered a bullish formation, especially when it appears in oversold conditions. He stressed that a breakout from this wedge is essential for Chainlink to trigger the next impulsive move upward, signaling a potential shift in momentum. CRYPTOWZRD explained that this breakout is more likely to occur once Bitcoin dominance begins to decline. As Bitcoin\u2019s grip loosens, altcoins like LINK tend to gain strength and follow suit. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin dominance will be key in anticipating LINK\u2019s next move. Regarding support levels, CRYPTOWZRD identified $12.50 as the critical next support target. A strong reversal from this point could ignite a rally toward the $16 resistance level or higher. This level will serve as a crucial testing ground for bullish momentum. He concluded by mentioning that his focus remains on lower-timeframe charts to identify quick scalp opportunities. While the broader trend is developing, CRYPTOWZRD is looking to capitalize on shorter-term movements, keeping a close eye on price action and volatility. Choppy Intraday Action Keeps Bulls Cautious Wrapping up the analysis, the analyst highlighted that LINK\u2019s intraday chart remained sluggish and choppy, offering little in terms of clear directional bias. A possible retest of the $12.85 support level\u2014or even a minor dip below it\u2014could still present a bullish reversal opportunity, potentially paving the way for a push toward the $14.40 resistance target. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals \u2018Opportunity\u2019 However, the analyst warned that if Chainlink holds below the $12.85 level, it could slip into prolonged sideways movement. This uncertain behavior will likely hinge on Bitcoin\u2019s overall market direction, which continues to heavily influence altcoin performance. With no clear trade setup currently in play, the analyst concluded that it&#8217;s best to remain patient for a cleaner structure to emerge before making any decisive moves.
