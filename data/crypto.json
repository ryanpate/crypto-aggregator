      "summary": "Bitcoin prices climbed by 5.07% in the past week to hit a local peak of $108,000 before experiencing a solid rejection. Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has remained in the $106,000 &#8211; $107,000 range showing no indications of a breakout in either market direction. Amidst this market consolidation, renowned crypto analyst with X username KillaXBT has highlighted the key liquidation zones in the present Bitcoin market structure that are critical to the next significant price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Bitcoin: Clustering At $103K\u2013$106K And $108K\u2013$111K &#8211; What Could This Mean? In a recent X post , KillaXBT shares that Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal decision zone as liquidation heatmap data from Coinglass reveals notable liquidity clusters forming on both ends of the current price range. The market expert explains that BTC is trapped between long and short liquidation zones in both low and high time frames (L/HTF) signaling a moment of market indecision On the 7-day chart (LTF), KillaXBT states there are accumulations of long positions between $103,400 and $106,000. This data suggests that a move below this price range could trigger cascading stop-losses and force liquidations, sending Bitcoin prices lower in a short-term decline. On the other hand, there are also liquidity clusters in the $108,000\u2013$109,000 region, indicating the presence of potentially significant short positions. A breakout above $109,000 could initiate a sharp short squeeze, perhaps driving prices higher toward the current all-time high in the $111,000 price range. Using the 30-day chart (HTF), KillaXBT provides more information on the Bitcoin market stalemate. The analyst notes that more short-side liquidations are clustered between $108,300 and $109,000 than long-side liquidations between $103,000 and $106,000. However, the presence of short positions at $111,000 presents a scenario where bulls could reclaim control if they successfully push past this upper resistance. Ultimately, KillaXBT concludes the current BTC market structure suggests a delicate balance with high-leverage positions stacked both above and below current prices. The market expert warns that traders refrain from engaging the market until the highlighted liquidation zones are tested.

Despite this drop in on-chain activity, exchange outflows of $310 million suggest a strong market confidence, as investors increasingly move their assets into private wallets, typically a sign of long-term holding intent.

Grab a drink, grab a snack and let\u2019s take a ride, shall we? \u2014 Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) August 18, 2022 Rise Of Tokenized Assets According to Steingraber, the first step involves issuing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies on the XRP Ledger. Every time a new token launches there, it would need XRP to settle transactions. That could push up daily demand. Today, only a handful of tokens sit on the XRP chain, but he sees that growing into the hundreds. If even 100 new coins adopt XRP settlements, demand could climb by billions of dollars each year. It consists of three components: 1 &#8211; Assets built on the XRP Ledger (Stablecoins are the \u201cutility\u201d) 2 &#8211; XRP becomes a reserve asset to power the utility 3 &#8211; XRP is removed from public supply by institutions This is how IT WILL. \ud83d\ude09 https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc \u2014 Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 28, 2025 Banks Holding XRP As Gold Based on reports, the second driver is banks treating XRP like a reserve asset. Instead of just trading it on public exchanges, financial firms would stash XRP in private ledgers to back their own digital currencies. He points to \u201cmany institutions\u201d that have already floated plans to include XRP in their reserve piles. If each of those firms holds hundreds of millions of dollars in XRP, it could remove a large chunk of supply from open markets. Institutional Absorption Of Supply Here\u2019s where the math gets eye\u2011popping. XRP\u2019s total supply is capped at 100 billion. But Steingraber says roughly 20 billion tokens remain in public hands after accounting for locks, burns, and lost keys. If big institutions lock away most of that, circulation could shrink to under 100 million. That would set the stage for a classic supply shock. He even predicts prices could surge from cents to thousands of dollars within hours once companies dive in. Regulatory And Competition Hurdles Despite the excitement, there are clear roadblocks. XRP is still fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court. A final loss could stall deals or scare off banks. At the same time, rival chains like Ethereum and Solana also host tokenized assets. Those networks already see billions in daily volume. XRP would need to prove it offers something stronger or faster to win over big players.

If any one of those doesn\u2019t materialize, the $20,000 mark drifts further away. Still, it makes for a gripping story. For now, XRP traders will watch legal filings and ledger activity with fresh eyes, wondering if this bold theory has any chance of coming true. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-weeks-away-from-third-golden-cross/",
      "summary": "The price of Litecoin didn\u2019t end May in the best possible way, especially considering its start to the month, falling from around $95 to beneath $85 before May 31st. While the start of June was quite strong, the altcoin has failed to maintain its bullish momentum each time a rally seemed to be on. After falling beneath the $80 level on June 22, the Litecoin price seems to be back on its feet as it currently dances around the $87 mark. Interestingly, a fresh price outlook portraying an even brighter future for the cryptocurrency has emerged. How Much LTC Price Surged After First Two Golden Crosses In a recent post on the X platform, Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino shared an exciting analysis of the Litecoin price. According to the crypto expert, the price of LTC could embark on an explosive rally depending on its movement over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Cardano Price Woes To Continue? Analyst Expects ADA To Fall To $0.47 This bullish projection is based on the potential formation of a Golden Cross \u2014 the third ever \u2014 on the Litecoin weekly chart. In a crypto context, a Golden Cross occurs when a short-term moving average (50-week moving average, in this case) crosses above a longer-term moving average (200-week moving average). Typically, Golden Cross formations often precede and are associated with extended periods of bullish price movements. However, Severino believes that Litecoin is just weeks of a significant rally away from triggering its third-ever Golden Cross on the weekly price chart. Source: @TonyTheBullCMT on X Severino cited the earlier two situations where the Golden Cross occurred after a substantial price rally. In the first instance, this chart phenomenon appeared on the Litecoin weekly timeframe after a 700% surge from the local lows in 2017. Meanwhile, the LTC rallied by 450% from its local bottom before the second-ever Golden Cross in 2021. For each time the Golden Cross appeared on the chart, the price of Litecoin witnessed a significant bullish momentum. In 2017, the LTC price soared by 7,100% from around $5 to as high as $360. The altcoin jumped by more than 380% to reach its current all-time high of $410 after the Golden Cross formation in 2021. If the Golden Cross does occur and history is anything to go by, the Litecoin price could be preparing to reach a new all-time high in its next leg up. Litecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $86.26, reflecting a 1.7% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the altcoin is up by more than 7% in the last seven days.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/td-sequential-flashes-buy-dogecoin-ready-for-rebound-to-0-21/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin has spent the majority of the past five days trading within a tight range between $0.156 and $0.165. Notably, the meme coin is now showing early signs of stabilization after its steep correction earlier this month, with bulls beginning to reclaim ground after a drop below the $0.17 price barrier. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin\u2019s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength Reclaiming the $0.17 level is important, according to technical analysis of Dogecoin&#8217;s price. This technical backdrop sets the stage for a projected price move to $0.21. TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal For Dogecoin Dogecoin&#8217;s 3-day candlestick timeframe chart shows that the meme coin is currently trading just above an ascending trendline that dates back to late 2023, which has acted as a key support level across multiple correction cycles. Despite the recent volatility, the price structure appears to be ready for a possible bounce move from here due to the formation of less volatile candlesticks and higher lows just above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level around $0.165. Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed an interesting bullish signal taking place on the same 3-day candlestick timeframe. According to Martinez, Dogecoin has just triggered a buy signal on the 3-day TD Sequential indicator. This tool, which identifies trend exhaustion and possible reversals, has been quite useful in predicting buy and sell zones this cycle. However, the bullish outlook depends on Dogecoin reclaiming the $0.17 price level, which is now working as some sort of resistance. Martinez noted that a breakout above this price level could allow Dogecoin to rebound to $0.21. Notably, this $0.21 price target coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci extension from Dogecoin\u2019s October 2023 low. Image From X: @ali_charts Path To $0.21 Needs Enough Volume For Dogecoin to confirm a return to $0.21, market participation must return in a meaningful way. This is because Dogecoin&#8217;s trading volume has been notably low over the past few days. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume is currently at just $400 million, which is a 36.7% decrease from the previous day. This level of activity is significantly below Dogecoin&#8217;s usual trading volume during periods of upward momentum. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role Such a slowdown in volume suggests that, despite the bullish technical signal from the TD Sequential indicator, the necessary follow-through from buyers is yet to be confirmed. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1637, up by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. Until volume picks up, Dogecoin may continue to consolidate or even drift sideways, regardless of the bullish indicators. Unless there&#8217;s strong interest and stronger inflows, the breakout setup could fizzle out or result in another rejection at $0.17. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-struggles-below-ath-after-weeks-of-failed-attempts-109k-level-in-focus/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has been consolidating in a wide range between $100,000 and $112,000, facing heightened volatility driven by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and growing macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite these external pressures, Bitcoin has held strong above the six-figure mark, signaling resilience as it prepares for a decisive move. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with many traders expecting a breakout in the coming weeks. Related Reading: ONDO Breaks Out Of Ascending Channel \u2013 Analyst Sets $0.29 Target Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting that Bitcoin is now trading just below its all-time high, but continues to face strong resistance around the $109,000\u2013$112,000 zone. Price has tested this level multiple times over the past month, but each attempt has failed to produce a confirmed breakout. During this period, altcoins have suffered sharp drawdowns, with many falling between 10% and 50%, underscoring Bitcoin\u2019s dominance and investor focus. Despite the rejections, bullish momentum is gradually building. Bitcoin\u2019s ability to stay elevated in such a volatile environment suggests that buyers are accumulating, waiting for the right moment to push higher. A confirmed breakout above resistance could trigger a sharp move into price discovery, while failure to hold key support may lead to deeper consolidation before the next leg up. Bitcoin Bulls Push Toward Breakout Bitcoin has gained over 15% since early May, extending a bullish trend that began in April when the price rebounded sharply from the $75,000 level. Since then, buyers have remained in control, consistently defending higher lows and reclaiming key technical levels. This steady rise in momentum has fueled speculation that Bitcoin may soon break into new all-time highs, as market sentiment improves and capital continues flowing into crypto. Analysts are now closely watching the $110,000\u2013$112,000 resistance zone\u2014a level that has held strong despite multiple breakout attempts. Daan noted that Bitcoin is trading just below its all-time high, but has already faced several failed moves above this barrier. Over the past month, price has hovered near resistance, yet hasn\u2019t delivered a confirmed breakout. During this period, altcoins have struggled, with many dropping between 10% and 50%, further highlighting Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance and traders&#8217; caution. While the setup looks bullish, risks remain. A proper breakout will require not just a brief wick above $110K, but a strong weekly close or at least two consecutive daily closes above resistance. Until then, it\u2019s wise to stay patient. Chasing before confirmation can lead to getting caught in a false breakout. Once Bitcoin breaks and holds above this level, the probability of a larger move increases significantly. In the meantime, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to hold near highs while absorbing macro volatility and altcoin weakness is a strong sign of underlying demand. Momentum is building\u2014but timing matters. A confirmed breakout will be the signal that the next leg up is ready to begin. Until then, smart traders are watching and waiting. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel \u2013 Next Move Could Be Parabolic BTC Weekly Chart Shows Strong Structure Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,319 on the weekly chart, continuing to hover just below the crucial $109,300 resistance level. Despite multiple attempts, BTC has failed to close a weekly candle above this zone\u2014a critical milestone needed to confirm a breakout and signal the next phase of upward momentum. The $103,600 level now serves as strong weekly support, holding firm through recent pullbacks. The long-term structure remains bullish. Price continues to trend above all major moving averages, including the 50-week SMA ($85,147), the 100-week SMA ($66,505), and the 200-week SMA ($49,239), all of which are sloping upward. This alignment reflects solid long-term strength, even as Bitcoin consolidates just below all-time highs. Volume, however, remains relatively muted compared to the breakout seen in late 2024, suggesting that traders are waiting for confirmation before committing to new positions. Until BTC can close a weekly candle above $109,300, this range will remain intact.
