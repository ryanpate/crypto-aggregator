Yet the respite may prove fleeting, says veteran technician Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend). Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2021 On side-by-side charts of the current cycle and the 2021-to-2024 arc, the analyst argued that Bitcoin is \u201cthe same exact pattern\u2014run-up, one high, back down, second high,\u201d followed by an ABC corrective sequence that in 2021 bottomed only after a second, deeper flush. \u201cGut says no,\u201d he told viewers when asked whether last Friday\u2019s sell-off had already marked capitulation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this ABC since March\u2026 people were calling for new lows; I said nope, we got five waves at the top, we got an ABC and then we go\u2014 and that\u2019s when the alts take off.\u201d His base case now envisions a relief rally toward the $107,000\u2013$108,000 band\u2014the level where a trend-line projected from the two post-halving peaks intersects\u2014before a final leg lower drives price into what he calls the \u201cpain box\u201d sandwiched between the 0.702 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracements of the entire rally from last October\u2019s $58,000 breakout. In 2021 that zone ultimately wicked to the exact 0.618, a move he believes could repeat, implying spot levels between roughly $96,500 and $92,000. \u201cThis measurement fits the parameter now\u2026 if it wants to turn around and rip, great,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut there\u2019s still a very good chance that was not the end.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss Internally, the analyst parses the current drop as the developing C-wave of a larger flat, subdividing into a classic five-wave impulse. Wave three, he notes, appears complete; wave four \u201ccould come up high,\u201d granting altcoins a short-lived pop, \u201cbut hopefully, again, sooner than later, we roll over.\u201d He cites 2021\u2019s July fractal, when Bitcoin bounced 20% before sliding a final time, as a psychological template. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a big news narrative event,\u201d he observed, \u201cwe\u2019ll get a little relief\u2014people think it\u2019s done\u2014then wham, one more thing to scare retail.\u201d Macro sentiment, he argues, remains fragile. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange gap at $92,000 is drawing \u201caverage-retail\u201d bids, a setup he characterises as a \u201cwashing machine\u201d in which professional money fronts liquidity only to fade it. \u201cRetail is just a washing machine, man\u2026 that buy isn\u2019t going to get filled,\u201d he warned. Still, he reiterated long-term optimism, revealing he \u201chammered some buys\u201d during Monday\u2019s dip and advising his followers to dollar-cost average\u2014\u201cnot financial advice\u201d\u2014through the turbulence.

For now, traders watch the 0.702\u20130.618 pocket and the mooted relief ceiling at $108,000. Should Bitcoin slice through support without that interim bounce, the analyst says, the flush could conclude \u201csooner than later,\u201d clearing the runway for what he calls \u201cthe next few months\u2014our moment.\u201d In his sign-off he urged viewers to \u201cbe an adult, live through it,\u201d but also confessed palpable excitement: \u201cI feel really good about where we\u2019re at.\u201d Whether the market shares his confidence will likely become clear once the final C-wave verdict arrives\u2014perhaps, he hopes, within the week.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-dont-send-it-too-hard-analyst/",
      "summary": "The news that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump may have marked the bottom for the Dogecoin price. Via X, independent chartist Maelius (@MaeliusCrypto) uploaded a weekly DOGE/USDT study that he believes is tracing an unusually clean, nested 1-2, 1-2 \u201cspring-loaded\u201d Elliott set-up \u2013 the kind of formation that often precedes an outsized third-wave rally. \u201cDOGE \u2026 Market makers, please, don\u2019t send it too hard,\u201d the analyst joked on 23 June, imploring liquidity desks to let the structure mature before unleashing volatility. Dogecoin Ready To Explode? In Maelius\u2019 count, the second of the two minor wave-twos ended last week when price tagged $0.142 and immediately snapped higher. That inflection, visible on his chart as the tip of a long lower wick, occurred exactly where the 200-week exponential moving average ($0.142) intersects a rising support trend-line that has tracked Dogecoin since late-2023 \u2013 a textbook area for long-term money to defend. The bounce printed on Sunday\u2019s weekly close, giving technicians a hard reference point for risk. If the wave map is correct, the composite third wave that now follows could push into the $1.10\u2013$1.30 corridor, Maelius annotates. A fourth-wave pause somewhere near $0.60 would then reset oscillators before a terminal fifth wave above $1.60 completes the cycle. While the analyst stops short of publishing time targets, the price levels are etched in full on the chart, making the roadmap unambiguous. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target Underlying demand is also drawn into the picture. A broad green rectangle labelled \u201cDEMAND\u201d spans roughly $0.12\u2013$0.17. Last week\u2019s wick once again penetrated that zone before reversing, adding statistical weight to its importance. At the bottom of Maelius\u2019 chart lies the WaveTrend Oscillator (WTO), comprising a fast line (WT1), a slow line (WT2) and a histogram that plots their spread. The analyst shades the band between about \u201360 and \u201330 in green to denote the oversold floor. Both momentum lines double-bottomed in that zone in autumn 2024 and April this year, immediately before price rocketed higher. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $4 Dogecoin After Exhausted Selling Phase As of Sunday\u2019s close WT1 prints \u201318.49 and WT2 \u201333.21, with the histogram at \u201322.80. In other words, momentum is cooling but could be reversing as it is touching Maelius\u2019 bottom zone as in previous instances. Sceptics note that a nested 1-2 count can fail if price undercuts the second wave-two, and that liquidity-driven memecoins are intrinsically prone to whipsaw. Even Maelius tempered his enthusiasm in a follow-up exchange when a follower warned of a \u201cchoppy summer,\u201d replying: \u201cWe are almost in July bro, one or two months of chop not changing anything if [it] happens.\u201d For now the battleground is clear: as long as Dogecoin holds above the converging 200-week EMA\u2013trend-line nexus and the upper rim of the demand zone, the wave thesis remains intact and the next directional verdict will belong to the market rather than the meme. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1634, up 17% since the bottom on Sunday. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "Is Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of 2021? Here\u2019s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-repeat-of-2021/",
      "summary": "Ethereum saw a notable decline in its price over the last week, and the weekend culmination pulled the price back towards levels not seen in over one month. The movement tracks with the established bearish trend of the month of June and continues to show mounting sell pressure on the cryptocurrency. However, with this decline has emerged a trend similar to what was seen back in 2021, right before the market picked up and saw the beginning of the altcoin season. Ethereum Price Crash Similar To 2021 Looking at the current Ethereum price action and that of what was seen back in Q2 2021, there have been some striking similarities. Most especially, how the Ethereum price has performed in the month of June so far has been the same as what happened back in June 2021. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens In 2021, the Ethereum price began the month of June trading above $2,600. However, as the month went on, the altcoin suffered multiple declines and crashed below $2,000 before it was over. Eventually, the price would find its bottom somewhere around $1,600 before the decline was over. Fast forward four years to the year 2025, and the month of June is showing the same trend. June 2025 had begun with the Ethereum price trending above $2,600 before the bears took control. Since then, the altcoin has crashed by more than 20%, and looks primed for more. Using the historical performance, it would suggest that the Ethereum price decline is far from over. If there is a repeat of June 2021, then Ethereum could suffer another 20% crash before the month of June is over, to find its bottom somewhere between $1,600 and $1,700. The Trigger For Altcoin Season Given that Ethereum is the largest altcoin in the market, it is naturally the trigger for the altcoin season. Looking back on 2021, the altcoin season began when the Ethereum price began to rally. But the recovery did not begin until the month of July, and eventually lasted into the month of November. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications So far, investors are already looking positively toward July 2025, as there have been rumors of a rate cut. This is expected to trigger a market rally for risk assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the fact that a resolution to the Iran-Israel war could be in the works. If this trend holds, then it is possible that the Ethereum price would begin to rally in July. As seen in 2021, Ethereum would end up rising over 200% in the course of five months, to put in a new all-time high in the month of November. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "This Bitcoin Zone Could Be Market\u2019s Next True \u2018Pivot,\u2019 Says Glassnode",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-zone-markets-next-true-pivot-glassnode/",
      "summary": "The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted the $97,000 to $98,000 zone as an important one for Bitcoin. Here&#8217;s why. Bitcoin CBD Suggests Build Up Of Supply In This Range In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about a potentially significant zone for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) is an indicator that measures the amount of the BTC supply that investors last purchased or transferred at the various price levels. As is visible in the above graph, there is a dense supply zone located between $97,000 to $98,000. Generally, investors are quite sensitive to retests of their cost basis, so a large amount of them (or alternatively, a few large holders) having their acquisition level inside a narrow range could make retests of it significant for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss When the mood in the market is bullish, holders can react to retests of their cost basis from above by buying more. They may do so believing that the same level would end up proving profitable again in the future and the retrace is just a &#8216;dip.&#8217; The cryptocurrency suffered a plunge yesterday and nearly touched this region. Since then, however, things have turned around for the asset and it has gained some distance over it once more. In the event that the decline does continue, which may not be too unexpected given the volatile geopolitical situation at the moment, the zone could end up acting as the next true pivot for Bitcoin, according to the analytics firm. While the CBD tells us where the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply is concentrated, it doesn&#8217;t contain any information about who bought or sold at those price levels. Glassnode&#8217;s behavioral cohorts, investor groups divided on the basis of their behavior, solve this problem. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by these holder cohorts over the past few years: There are five of these behavior groups. First Buyers (green) include the investors who are buying Bitcoin for the very first time. As displayed in the chart, the supply of this group has been on the rise, indicating fresh demand has been coming in. Momentum Buyers (blue) are those that capitalize on market momentum by buying during uptrends. On the opposite spectrum are the Conviction Buyers (purple), who buy despite falling prices.
