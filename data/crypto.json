      "summary": "Bitcoin has continued to trade within a tight range just below its previous all-time high, showing recent signs of upward movement but falling short of reclaiming its peak price. The asset recorded a seven-day high of $110,307, but it has since cooled, with current trading levels around $108,311, representing a slight 0.3% drop over the last 24 hours. While the broader market maintains cautious optimism, several indicators suggest that market participants remain split on where Bitcoin is headed next. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So Bitcoin Shorts Increase on Binance Despite Price Climb Despite the price strength seen in recent days, certain signals hint at increasing friction between bullish price action and bearish positioning from traders. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, Bitcoin\u2019s rise is being met with a counterintuitive decline in funding rates on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume. This trend could play a crucial role in shaping short-term market behavior. BorisVest noted that as Bitcoin consolidates within the $100,000 to $110,000 range, funding rates on Binance have gradually declined. This suggests that a significant number of traders are taking short positions\u2014essentially betting that Bitcoin\u2019s rally will soon reverse. The analyst explained that this behavior indicates skepticism about the sustainability of the recent price gains, particularly among retail and leverage-focused traders. \u201cThe declining funding rates show that users on Binance are increasingly shorting Bitcoin,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis dynamic often creates forced exits as short positions come under pressure, leading to liquidations or forced margin increases. These events can further propel upward price movement as positions get closed out automatically.\u201d Given Binance\u2019s dominance in trading volume, BorisVest emphasized that its funding rate trend serves as a strong proxy for overall market sentiment. If current positioning continues, the market may see a short squeeze, which could accelerate Bitcoin\u2019s momentum toward new highs. On-Chain Metric Flags Caution as NVT Golden Cross Edges Higher While futures market dynamics are drawing attention, on-chain data is also showing signs worth monitoring. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, highlighted the movement of Bitcoin\u2019s NVT Golden Cross metric, a tool used to assess market value in relation to on-chain transaction volume. This metric has historically signaled local tops when it moves above specific thresholds. In his analysis, Kesmeci pointed out that the NVT Golden Cross successfully identified three prior short-term peaks in 2025, each followed by corrections ranging from 9% to over 20%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High? The metric currently sits at 1.98, below the 2.2 threshold that has often indicated overheated market conditions, but is trending upward. \u201cWhile the current level isn\u2019t yet in the danger zone,\u201d Kesmeci wrote, \u201cits upward trajectory could be an early warning that price momentum is beginning to overextend.\u201d However, the analyst cautioned against interpreting the signal as immediately bearish. In previous cases, the NVT Golden Cross remained elevated for several days before a correction followed. This behavior may instead point to continued strength among bulls, at least in the medium term, even if a near-term pullback remains possible.

In that sense, traders should closely monitor any bullish price action close to the $2.35 area, and an hourly close above this level as potential confirmation. XRP Price close to completing an inverted head and shoulders pattern hinting at further gains. Source: Ali Martinez via X Last week, Martinez pointed at a similar breakout as the XRP price trended around the $2.2 level. However, at that time, the cryptocurrency failed to achieve the $2.35 breakout and continued trading in a tight channel between this level and $2.13. A separate analyst believes that XRP is close to a rally and placed the target above Martinez\u2019s claiming that the cryptocurrency could hit $2.69 on short timeframes. For this analyst, a breakout above $2.4 holds the key to future gains. The analyst stated: $XRP strength is telling. Something is brewing What\u2019s Behind the Momentum? The XRP price positive performance could be attributed to the massive inflow of capital coming into its ecosystem. A report from CoinShares claims that the total Asset under Management for cryptocurrencies hit a high of $188 billion, and $1 billion just over the past week. XRP has seen $335 million in year-to-date inflows, and a $10.6 million inflow over the past week. Several analysts believe these inflows represent bullish expectations for the cryptocurrency as Ripple is close to securing a banking license from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
