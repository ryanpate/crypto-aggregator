      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-cycle-high-at-20-30/",
      "summary": "The XRP price could be preparing for a historical rally, as a prominent crypto analyst has boldly predicted that the cryptocurrency could reach a fresh cycle top between $20 and $30. The forecast, which presents a massive upside for the altcoin, is based on the Elliott Wave Theory\u2014a key technical analysis tool. XRP Wave Map Signals Cycle Top Ahead Crypto analyst, XForceGlobal on X (formerly Twitter) has presented a bold new forecast for XRP, projecting a cycle high between $20 and $30. The analyst shared a chart that dissects XRP\u2019s price action over the last several months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is currently in the final stages of a corrective wave before beginning a powerful multi-leg impulsive rally. If this wave count plays out as the market expert says, XRP could be on the verge of its most aggressive breakout to date. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $3.61 In Short Term As \u2018Cup\u2019 Turns Hot The analysis focuses on XRP\u2019s medium-term correction, which has taken the form of a complex WXY structure. According to the chart, XRP is nearing the completion of Wave 2, a corrective phase that began after the last upward impulse. XForceGlobal has pinpointed a key Fibonacci confluence zone between $1.60 and $1.90, where XRP\u2019s pullback is expected to find support. The chart clearly marks this area as a potential springboard for the next bullish phase, as long as the price does not fall below the $1.618 level, which serves as the invalidation point for the current setup. Despite XRP\u2019s historical track record of sluggish performance and ongoing skepticism within the crypto community about the bullish forecast, XForceGlobal maintains confidence that the cryptocurrency will reach the ambitious $20-$30 cycle top\u2014a move he believes could unfold well into 2026. Intermediate Targets First, Cycle High Later According to XForceGlobal\u2019s chart, once XRP completes its current corrective move, the analyst predicts that the first leg of this upcoming rally may take the cryptocurrency past the $5 mark in Wave 3, followed by a deeper Wave 4 pullback and a final thrust into Wave 5 toward $6 or more. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 While these targets represent an intermediate-term bullish setup, on a macro scale, the long-term wave map implies that the whole structure could later culminate in a parabolic cycle top rally that sends XRP between $20 and possibly even $30. This optimistic outlook gains further credibility, as the analyst notes that XRP\u2019s internal wave count for the flat scenario has taken longer to resolve than initially expected. Beyond technicals, XForceGlobal highlights that market psychology plays a central role in its bullish forecast. He notes that the XRP community has weathered regulatory battles, market crashes, and years of stagnation, most notably the US SEC lawsuit. This prolonged adversity has turned XRP holders into \u201cbattle-tested veterans\u201d who are largely immune to fear-driven selling. This resilience, according to the analyst, could be the key to the next bullish phase of XRP\u2019s price action. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Want to check on Bitcoin\u2019s latest price moves? Just pop over to CoinMarketCap and\u2026 enter your wallet info? On June 20, 2025, visitors to a number of major crypto sites, including CoinTelegraph and CoinMarketCap, were prompted to connect their crypto wallets before accessing the site. The pop-up was a hack, a wallet-stealer designed to siphon information away from users. CoinMarketCap users can create accounts and connect wallets to track their portfolios, so the pop-up itself might not have seemed entirely out-of-place. Users quickly uncovered the hack, and affected sites moved rapidly to limit the damage. The incident highlights a new potential vulnerability in the growing crypto ecosystem. With such attacks, phishing can occur even on trusted platforms. What Wallet? Hacks Exploited Common Wallet Connectivity Features The incident involved the injection of malicious JavaScript code into CoinMarketCap\u2019s homepage. When unsuspecting users visited the site, they were greeted with a realistic-looking \u2018Connect Wallet to Verify\u2019 popup, mimicking standard Web3 wallet connection prompts. Users who clicked the popup and approved the transaction gave attackers full access to their wallets. The CMC hack reportedly had 39 victims with over $18K in losses. The script was since removed, and CMC has patched the vulnerability. Cointelegraph Also Targeted Just days later, on June 23, Cointelegraph, another prominent crypto news outlet, faced a similar attack. In this case, attackers managed to compromise an ad-serving network, injecting code that produced a fake token airdrop popup promoting a nonexistent \u2018Cointelegraph token&#8217; or &#8216;CTG.&#8217; The popup redirected users to a phishing site designed to harvest wallet signatures. Once again, users who interacted and signed the transaction lost access to their funds. Cointelegraph quickly issued a warning across its social media channels and disabled the malicious script. Both the CMC and CT hacks are part of a growing category of crypto hacks focused on compromising wallets. Per CertiK\u2019s quarterly report, these attacks produce the largest losses (over $1.450M in Q1 2025 alone). Wallet compromises are not as successful as other attacks, ranking last by incident count. But when they work, hackers can make off with vast amounts quickly. Vigilance and Knowing the Warning Signs: Key to Avoid Losses Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) took to X and warned users to \u2018be careful when authorizing wallet connect.\u2019 Both the CMC and CT hacks used pop-ups, one for a simple wallet connect prompt, and one for a purported crypto airdrop. Cointelegraph&#8217;s official account also posted a warning, urging users to not click the pop-ups, connect wallets, or provide their personal information. Crypto airdrops and crypto presales are often used by legitimate projects to develop early interest and generate buzz about new projects, making such phishing attacks more convincing. Scammers create fakes in order to encourage investors to give away wallet information. The supposed project or token \u2013 in this case \u2018CTG\u2019 \u2013 never existed. How do investors stay safe? Avoiding any unexpected or unusual pop-ups, even from trust sources, is a first step. And when it comes to the crypto ICOs and presales, it&#8217;s important to get your info from trusted sources. This is where a new solution, Best Wallet, stands out. This new app is the only Web3 wallet with a presale directory where you can browse only audited, secure presale tokens. The wallet also employs Multi-Party Computation technology, protecting your key from phishing attacks and hacks. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 The World\u2019s First and Only Crypto Presale Wallet The evolution of crypto hacks is unfortunately part of crypto&#8217;s growing market and popularity. New Web3 solutions, like Best Wallet, are evolving to tackle these security challenges, becoming a critical part of the crypto economy. And the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is here to power-up the Best Wallet ecosystem and provide additional perks for holders. With $BEST, token holders can trade and swap tokens more easily, participate in community governance, and earn higher staking rewards. The token also allows early access to the best crypto presales, gathered and vetted by Best Wallet in their \u2018Upcoming Tokens\u2019 section. Here, investors can find upcoming crypto projects, as well as all the key information, such as whitepapers and tokenomics, needed to do research before investing. That makes Best Wallet&#8217;s platform and token some of the handiest tools for crypto investors who want to avoid shady pop-ups and still stay ahead of the markets. Most importantly, Best Wallet is non-custodial and privacy-focused; investors control all their wallet keys and can sign up and swap crypto without KYC. The Best Wallet token presale has raised $13.5M so far, with the coin currently priced at $0.025225. Note that, given its sought-after, privacy-oriented wallet, the $BEST token could reach $0.05 by the end of 2026 after a successful launch, delivering 102% returns to early investors. If you&#8217;re interested in supporting the project, now&#8217;s the right opportunity to buy the Best Wallet Token at the lowest price. Visit Best Wallet&#8217;s Token presale today. Security in the Age of Web3 The recent front-end Cointelegraph and CoinMarketCap hacks mark a dangerous new phase in crypto security threats. Unlike traditional hacking methods that target backend systems or databases, these exploits weaponize the user interface, where trust is assumed but rarely verified. Secure Web3 wallets like Best Wallet can go a long way towards mitigating such growing risks. As always, do your own research before investing or choosing a crypto service provider.

This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status. pic.twitter.com/PTfZaAXFp7 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 22, 2025 Market Dips On Geopolitical News Based on reports, it was US strikes on Iran that triggered the initial slide. The price drop happened late Sunday, pushing Bitcoin below six figures for the first time since early May. Yet buyers stepped in quickly, snapping up coins and lifting the price back above $101,000 during the first hours of trading in Asia. That pattern shows how headline shocks can spark fast moves, but also how quickly sentiment can flip. Altcoins Take A Hit Meanwhile, over the past 12 hours, most altcoins fell about 1.4%, dragging total crypto market cap down by roughly $50 billion to $3.20 trillion, according to data. Experts expect that trend to reverse once major headlines calm down. Market analysts pointed out that altcoins might start to outperform if macro risks ease. They said smaller tokens are already showing signs of strength, even as Bitcoin stalls. Key Technical Levels Hold Traders are watching two key lines: the short-term realized price at $98,000 and the trend support at $102,000. The realized price reflects the average breakeven point for holders, so it often acts like a floor.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-run-over-what-top-trader-just-said/",
      "summary": "With Bitcoin precariously recovering above the $100,000 mark and altcoins bleeding momentum, traders are asking the obvious: Is the crypto bull run over? According to systematic trader Adam Bakay (@abetrade), the answer is not so clear-cut. In a detailed market breakdown posted June 22, Bakay offered a technically grounded, cautiously defensive assessment\u2014one that acknowledges geopolitical risks but stays rooted in positioning and price structure. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? \u201cLooking at the monthly and weekly timeframes, we are still technically in an uptrend,\u201d Bakay wrote, noting that \u201cno key swing low was broken, and the 365-day rolling VWAP has been respected during the pullback in April.\u201d Despite this, he admits that \u201cthe failure to make new all-time highs similar to the top in 2021\u201d is a concern\u2014especially given the accumulation by players like BlackRock, which now holds around 3.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply. It\u2019s that divergence\u2014between strong institutional interest and a market struggling to break higher\u2014that has made Bakay more cautious in recent weeks. \u201cThis is why I have been very defensive and kept most of my trades short-term,\u201d he said. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant His trading view focuses on two potential technical scenarios: either a reclaim of the $100,000 support area\u2014\u201clikely if the conflict in the Middle East does not further escalate\u201d\u2014or a dip into the $97,000\u2013$95,000 range, where strong technical support resides in the form of the 200-day moving average, local price structure, and the 90-day rolling VWAP. Still, Bakay made it clear he\u2019s not shorting the market. \u201cI am not currently considering any short trades due to my current positioning,\u201d he emphasized, adding that open interest is dropping and that we are starting to see the \u201cfirst signs of clear spot bid interest since the April lows.\u201d The options market, meanwhile, is flashing early caution: the 25-delta risk reversal skew sits around -5, not yet at panic levels, but trending more negative. Crypto Bull Run In Jeopardy On Ethereum, Bakay was notably blunt. \u201cETH almost had its moment, but of course had to become a disappointment,\u201d he said. He attributes the failed breakout in part to how quickly the \u201cDeFi Summer 2025\u201d narrative went viral. \u201cPeople are getting too horny, and market made sure to punish them,\u201d he noted, referencing his own tweet from a few days earlier. Related Reading: Crypto\u2019s Unlikely Ally: Top Analyst Reveals War As A Surprising Bullish Force The technical picture on ETH doesn\u2019t inspire confidence either. \u201cDuring significant market moves, like we had at the beginning of May, the last thing you want to see is price retracing throughout that area,\u201d he explained, saying the next meaningful support lies near $1,800. On the daily chart, Ethereum is sitting right at a confluence of support\u2014both the 90-day rolling VWAP and what he calls a \u201cpivotal level.\u201d Still, much like Bitcoin, Bakay sees Ethereum\u2019s short-term fate as largely dependent on developments in the Middle East. On positioning, ETH also shows signs of an oversold environment, though Bakay believes high volatility in ETH options has caused traders to use spreads instead of outright directional bets. \u201cPositioning is now very clearly pointing towards the possible upside reversal in both perpetual and spot,\u201d he said. Altcoins received no reprieve. \u201cAltcoins have not been having fun for quite a while,\u201d Bakay wrote, pointing out that \u201cevery time it starts to look better, it will almost immediately get worse.\u201d He notes that the expected rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins hasn\u2019t materialized, and the real rotation now seems to be into crypto-related equities, which better reflect the ETF-driven macro trade. Even strong names like Solana are fading. \u201cSOL has almost retraced the entire rally from April,\u201d he warned. The key level to watch is $100. \u201cThere is not much of a technical support sub-$100,\u201d and if \u201cshit hits the fan,\u201d Bakay would look to bid around that round number. Bakay also briefly touched on two newer altcoins\u2014Hype and Fartcoin\u2014saying one offers a solid product and the other draws interest through volatility and liquidity. \u201cFartcoin would become attractive if it could reclaim the $1 or $0.50 area. Hype could find a bounce sub-$30.\u201d His closing thoughts were pragmatic: \u201cWe are not in easy market conditions, with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and markets can be significantly affected by a single news release.\u201d While he believes the market may be \u201cgetting too short at the moment,\u201d he remains highly conscious of the possibility that a multi-month correction is already in play. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a need to be a hero and try to catch a falling knife,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI would much rather wait for some positive news and signs of lower timeframe reversals.\u201d In essence, Bakay doesn\u2019t call the top. But his post makes one thing clear: this is not a market for bravado. It\u2019s a time for restraint, tight risk management, and respect for volatility\u2014especially when the bullish case no longer has momentum on its side. At press time, BTC traded at $101,847.
