      "summary": "Despite its choppy price action in the past seven days, the mood in the XRP camp is increasingly bullish. Particularly, XRP is witnessing a wave of bold predictions from several top crypto analysts. This comes just as a major real-world asset tokenization project promises to increase demand and utility for XRP on a global scale by tokenizing $200 million worth of assets on the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s True Value Is Higher Than $110,000, Expert Warns Not Bullish Enough On XRP? Crypto analyst CrediBULL is pushing a bold message to the XRP community: the market is still underestimating the altcoin&#8217;s bullish setup. In a post on social media platform X, he noted that XRP is currently going on its eighth month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, which is a feat that few assets in the market can match. He pointed to this extended sideways movement, especially after a strong impulse off the $0.50 level in late 2024, as evidence that XRP is preparing for a continuation of the breakout. Notably, its monthly candlestick chart shows a tight cluster of monthly candles hovering above the $2.00 range. According to CrediBULL, this structure is one of the cleanest in the crypto space, second only to Bitcoin. Image From X: CrediBULL Another major contributor to the current bullish narrative is an analyst known as Ripple Pundit, who projected a 35,000% price surge for XRP the moment Ripple announces a banking license. In his post on the social media platform, he predicted that a regulatory greenlight and the final resolution of XRP&#8217;s regulatory overhang with the SEC could trigger a significant increase in price. Similarly, market commentator SMQKE drew attention to the explosive XRP price surge in late 2017 and early 2018, during which Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen briefly became one of the wealthiest individuals in the world due to XRP\u2019s quick rally from $0.00065 to $2.5. SMQKE noted that the last cycle was merely a glimpse of what\u2019s coming. The next wave of adoption will be global, fully regulated, and built for scale. In his words, \u201c2018 was just a warm-up.\u201d Technical analyst Ali Martinez added further credibility to the bullish case by pointing out the $2.38 level as the next major resistance. This is based on on-chain data from Glassnode\u2019s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which shows a significant XRP volume concentrated at this price level. If XRP manages to clear this area with strong volume, it would not only overcome heavy resistance but also trigger a cascade of buying interest and a major rally. Image From X: @ali_charts Mercado Bitcoin Tokenization Deal On XRPL XRP\u2019s underlying utility is also gaining traction beyond price charts and predictions. Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America\u2019s largest digital asset platforms, recently announced plans to tokenize over $200 million worth of real-world assets (including fixed income and equity instruments) directly on the XRP Ledger.

      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s price action is gearing up for a surge of epic proportions, according to crypto technical analyst MasterAnanda on the TradingView platform. Ethereum has spent a majority of the past two months consolidating above the $2,425 support zone, in what might be an accumulation phase before a major breakout. Nonetheless, MasterAnanda&#8217;s analysis suggests that Ethereum is on the verge of entering its strongest bullish wave in years, with a breakout target that starts at $5,791. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Ethereum To Break Out To At Least $5,791 MasterAnanda\u2019s weekly candlestick chart shows a large ETH wedge pattern with consistently rising lows from June 2022 to April 2025. On the other hand, price highs have been relatively flat, specifically around the March and December 2024 peaks. Ethereum\u2019s behavior since April has been marked by low volatility and sideways movement, which often precedes large market moves. The most interesting move was when its price dropped to as low as $1,470 on April 9 before quickly rebounding and establishing a rounded bottom formation. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that Ethereum is due a major, major bullish wave. The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will. Now that the current consolidation is sitting right above trendline support, MasterAnanda argues that this formation will soon give way to a powerful bullish wave. The target is a minimum of $5,791, which is based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. Interestingly, the analyst noted that it is possible for the Ethereum price to reach $8,500 or higher in the longer term if it breaks above the resistance trendline, which is currently at $4,000. This prediction is backed by improving fundamentals and current on-chain data showing accumulation through Spot Ethereum ETFs. Wyckoff Accumulation Says It&#8217;s Ethereum\u2019s Turn Crypto analyst Ted Pillows shared a separate but related analysis on the social platform X that&#8217;s based on a Wyckoff accumulation pattern playing out on ETH\u2019s weekly chart. Pillows called the selloff to the $1,470 low in April as the \u201cSpring\u201d phase of Wyckoff accumulation, followed by a successful \u201cTest\u201d of a September 2024 support around $2,145, and the gradual move back to resistance now. According to his projection, Ethereum\u2019s breakout will unfold in stages. The first stage is a push to $3,000, then a correction, followed by a rise to $4,000 in Q3. Only after these steps will the parabolic leg truly begin. The parabolic leg, in this case, should take Ethereum above $5,700, if the price action plays out as predicted. Related Reading: XRP\u2019s Time Is Now, Says Pundit\u2014Don\u2019t Snooze On The \u2018Biggest Transfer Of Wealth\u2019 His analysis closely aligns with MasterAnanda\u2019s call for a minimum $5,791 target. Just as the Wyckoff accumulation pattern pumped Bitcoin to its most recent all-time high, Ethereum may be on the verge of its own spotlight moment in this ongoing 2025 bull cycle. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,516. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"

      "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-exchange-outflows-continue-to-rise/",
      "summary": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has not been particularly impressive over the weekend, which has been a somewhat consistent theme of the cryptocurrency market so far in the year 2025. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $108,000 mark, showing signs of indecision amongst the investors. With the coin\u2019s indecisive price action, the conversation has been about when the Bitcoin price will return to its all-time high. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio Below 1: On-Chain Analyst In a July 5 post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost revealed that Bitcoin has continued to flow out of centralized exchanges over the past few months. The online crypto pundit mentioned that this trend reflects the growing confidence of investors in the long term. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio 30DMA, a metric that measures the volume of BTC flowing in and out of centralized exchanges over a period of 30 days. A high ratio (&#62;1) indicates more inflows than outflows into exchanges, signaling increased selling pressure for the premier cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a low ratio (&#60;1) implies that more coins are flowing out of rather than into centralized exchanges. When the Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio has a low value, it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding their coins in the long term. According to Darkfost, the Bitcoin monthly outflow/inflow ratio recently fell to around 0.9, its lowest level since the bear market of 2023. With the metric now beneath the 1 threshold, it means that Bitcoin exchange outflows are dominant, reflecting a strong and sustained demand on the spot market. The on-chain analyst said: As of today, demand remains present as outflows continue to dominate, with a growing number of long-term holders stepping in. Ultimately, Darkfost believes that the confidence being shown in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term promise is expected, considering the growing adoption by major corporations and governments, most notably in the United States. \u201cBTC is gradually evolving into a store of value, increasingly used to strengthen treasury strategies,\u201d the crypto analyst added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $108,103, reflecting a mere 0.3% increase in the past 24 hours.

Adoption Numbers And Hype Based on reports from River, nearly 5% of the world\u2019s population has used or owns Bitcoin so far. That\u2019s a long way from Blockware\u2019s forecast that 10% could be on board by 2030. Those numbers show that while the buzz is loud, real wallets holding Bitcoin remain few. For many, Bitcoin is still a headline rather than a habit. State Level Moves Shift Policy Last month, Texas became the first US state to set up a public Bitcoin stockpile. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21, creating a standalone fund run by state&#8217;s comptroller. That setup keeps the reserve out of the normal state treasury, so it can\u2019t be raided for other expenses. A follow\u2011up bill, HB 4488, cements its legal protection, making sure the fund stays intact no matter what. Not every state has pushed ahead. In May, Florida dropped its crypto legislation, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma in pulling back. Arizona\u2019s House Bill 1025, despite getting farther than any similar measure, was vetoed by US President Donald Trump on May 3. Bitcoin Lyrics Hit Home Drake\u2019s new verse isn\u2019t his first high\u2011stakes play with crypto. Back in 2022, he put $1 million worth of Bitcoin bet on the Super Bowl. That bold wager grabbed headlines and showed he takes crypto chances seriously.

Looking ahead, Drake\u2019s new song and Texas\u2019s reserve show two sides of crypto\u2019s rise. The pop\u2011culture nods pull attention, while real\u2011world policies test whether Bitcoin can move from hype into everyday use. If both trends keep climbing, Bitcoin could win more hearts\u2014and wallets\u2014in the years to come. Featured image from Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty, chart from TradingView"

      "title": "Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/are-bitcoin-retail-traders-back-in-the-market-on-chain-data/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin started the month of July with a convincing rally to the upside, suggesting a sustained bullish sentiment amongst investors from its performance by the end of June. The upward rally, however, cooled off following the release of positive employment data by the United States. Traders might have expected this data to be typically bullish, but that has hardly been the reality for the Bitcoin price. Nevertheless, a certain investor cohort, as shown by on-chain revelation, has decided to return to the market and bet on the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Retail Investors In, Long-Term Holders Out? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha highlighted the increasing divergence between retail and institutional behavior in the BTC market. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Taha started by pointing out that Binance Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has remained below $11.5 billion. The crypto pundit explained that this price level has been acting as strong resistance, as Bitcoin traders have repeatedly closed positions near this price threshold. Interestingly, these levels are very close to the same price region around which resistance was observed on June 10th. Taha stated that this could mean the bullish momentum is beginning to wane for the flagship cryptocurrency. On another hand, short-term holders (STH), who are typically the retail traders, have increased their exposure to the market by about 382,000 BTC. This can only mean that there has been renewed retail interest in the flagship cryptocurrency. Contrary to the short-term holders\u2019 actions, the long-term holders (LTH) reduced their holdings by an amount similar to the STH exposure. Taha explained that this could be a result of profit taking or risk management within this investor class. In essence, the retail investors are \u201cbuying the dip,\u201d while the more experienced are seemingly reducing their risks. Bitcoin Whales Enter Distribution Phase Also supporting the conceived idea of caution in institutions and whales, Taha reported that large holders (holders with over 10,000 BTC) offloaded about 12,000 BTC on the 3rd of July. This kind of move, according to the analyst, signals potential profit taking or perhaps strategic reallocation. Besides what they might signify, large transactions tend to have a substantial impact on market dynamics, as significant amounts of BTC are involved in each trade. However, the large holders were not the only profit takers. According to Taha, mid-sized whales (those holding 1,000-10,000 BTC) also shed some of their holdings. From June 30th, approximately 14,000 BTC were sold by this class. Deducible from these transactions is the idea that the whales seem to be in their distribution phase, either because they anticipate further bearish momentum or await better positioning opportunities. If macro conditions remain favorable, the Bitcoin market could resume its bullish rally, but this ultimately falls on the renewal of larger players&#8217; confidence. For now, the road ahead remains uncertain. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $108,152, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.
