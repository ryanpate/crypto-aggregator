      "summary": "Data shows the US Ethereum spot ETFs have seen net inflows for eight consecutive weeks now, a sign of continued institutional demand. Ethereum Spot ETF Netflow Remains Positive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the weekly netflow for the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of Ethereum has been looking. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. These ETFs trade on the traditional platforms, so they allow for an easier investment method for those who find cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets overwhelming to navigate. Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the American Ethereum spot ETFs have been doing lately: From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the netflow related to the Ethereum spot ETFs has recently been on a green streak. This means that inflows into wallets attached to the ETFs are continuously happening. Last week saw a net inflow of 61,000 ETH, worth $157.3 million at the current exchange rate. With these inflows, the spot ETFs of the cryptocurrency have seen positive values for eight straight weeks. Since institutional investors generally take this investment route into Ethereum, the continuous inflows could be a sign of sustained demand from them. Despite this interest, the ETH price has remained locked in a phase of sideways movement. Ethereum isn&#8217;t the only asset that&#8217;s observing demand on the ETFs. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has pointed out in an X post, Bitcoin has also been enjoying net inflows. As displayed in the above chart, the Bitcoin ETFs have seen a positive netflow on 16 out of the last 17 trading days. The one exception was on July 1st, when outflows occurred. In some other news, Ethereum has observed new on-chain capital inflows during the past week, as Glassnode has revealed in another X post. In the graph, the data for the Realized Cap of coins aged less than 1 week is shown for Ethereum and Solana. The &#8220;Realized Cap&#8221; measures the amount of capital that the investors have put into a given network. The version of the metric of focus here specifically calculates the capital that has come in over the past week. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the metric has seen an increase for both ETH and SOL during the past week, indicating fresh capital has flowed in. The latter has outperformed the former, however, with the metric standing at $6.2 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,580, up over 5% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "The Bitcoin market appears to be coiling for a major move, according to prominent crypto analyst CrediBull Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), who highlighted today via X that over 80% of all Bitcoin in existence is currently being held by long-term investors\u2014levels of supply constraint previously seen only at major inflection points in Bitcoin\u2019s price history. Why No One\u2019s Selling Bitcoin In his post, CrediBull noted, \u201cThe only 2 times in Bitcoin&#8217;s 15 year history that this % was higher was at 43k before a $30,000 impulse to 73k and at 58k before a $50,000 impulse to 105k+.\u201d Drawing on this historical precedent, he concluded that the market is poised for another massive leg up: \u201cWhen the majority of $BTC total circulating supply is cornered by \u2018diamond hands\u2019, price moves up aggressively at the hint of any \u2018new\u2019 demand.\u201d With &#8220;excess&#8221; supply now redistributed to long-term holders and institutional entities such as Bitcoin treasury companies increasingly taking the lead, the analyst sees a clear signal: \u201cThe next impulse IS IMMINENT. This next one will also likely be even bigger than the last two ($50,000+). Who&#8217;s ready for 150k+ Bitcoin?\u201d Related Reading: 2025\u2019s Biggest Bitcoin Bull Trigger Is Still Hidden, Expert Reveals The optimism is not without a technical underpinning. In a previous post, CrediBull addressed the current market structure and his own Elliott Wave-based scenario planning: \u201cMy original count/idea shared a few days ago had us rejecting at range highs above 110k and seeing a pullback down to the BLUE zone at 102k-ish before moving sideways for a few more weeks before the next impulse begins.\u201dHowever, the analyst acknowledged a significant alternative possibility: \u201cI do still think this scenario is probable, I also recognize that there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun (most bullish scenario depicted).\u201d Given the price action and structure, CrediBull argued that the risk-reward profile no longer favors bearish positioning. \u201cIn either case, downside is relatively limited on Bitcoin from current levels imo and so focus should be on identifying potential long opps on Bitcoin rather than looking to short clear strength.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut\u2014What You Need To Know He punctuated the point with a rhetorical jab: \u201cWhy is it now illegal to short Bitcoin? Because there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun.\u201d Adding a layer of technical confirmation, analyst Axel Adler Jr provided a concurrent signal from volatility metrics. Adler pointed to a significant Bollinger Bands squeeze underway, writing: \u201cThe range between the upper and lower boundaries has fallen to 7.7%\u2014one of the lowest values throughout the entire bull cycle.\u201d Such compressions in volatility historically precede large directional moves. Adler explained, \u201cThe decrease in volatility indicates energy accumulation in the market; the price is ready for a rally, and in an upward trend environment, the chances of an upward breakout are significantly higher.\u201d In the current cycle, Adler has identified six episodes of such squeezes. Four were immediately followed by strong price appreciation, while the remaining two saw brief corrections before continuing upward. The takeaway: \u201cBased on this experience, the current squeeze most likely foreshadows another upward impulse, although a small consolidation before the move is also not ruled out.\u201d With long-term holders now controlling an overwhelming share of supply, bullish technical compression in play, and institutional adoption continuing to absorb circulating coins, the environment CrediBull describes echoes past moments of explosive upside. While nothing is guaranteed, the combination of on-chain metrics and technical indicators suggest Bitcoin\u2019s next chapter may already be beginning\u2014quietly, beneath the surface.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-to-92000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action is holding firm above the $108,000 level despite a string of minor pullbacks in recent trading sessions. Notably, CoinGecko data shows that the Bitcoin price has climbed to an intraday high of $109,116, but it wasn&#8217;t able to hold above and has retreated slightly lower at the time of writing. Volatility has been relatively subdued for Bitcoin above $106,000. However, Doctor Profit, a well-followed crypto analyst, believes Bitcoin is still in a bullish structure, and he outlined two likely paths for the next major move. Bull Flag And Breakout To $130,000 With Retest The first scenario outlined by Doctor Profit involves a breakout to a price level between $113,000 and $114,000, which would take Bitcoin to a new all-time high in the process. However, this all-time high would be very brief. According to this scenario, a sharp correction is expected to follow once Bitcoin reaches this range. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This correction will send the price back down into the $92,000 to $93,000 range to fill a CME gap and tap into a major liquidity pool. Rather than causing panic, the analyst views this move as part of a bullish continuation. This potential retracement zone is clearly marked on Doctor Profit&#8217;s daily candlestick chart with the message \u201cAdd more if market allows.\u201d The pullback, if it happens, would serve to reset the market and initiate a bounce before Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory to $120,000 again. Direct Rally To $120,000 Without Retest The second path skips the correction altogether. In this scenario, Bitcoin breaks through the flag resistance to rally past $113,000. From there, the scenario sees Bitcoin continuing upward without returning to the lower support zones. The move hinges on the ability of Bitcoin to gain momentum rapidly and lead to a strong push toward $120,000. Doctor Profit points out that this option is a more aggressive bullish continuation, and both scenarios are valid for bullish price targets in the long term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline He also debunked fears surrounding the sudden movement of a dormant Satoshi-era whale wallet containing 80,000 BTC. The analyst believes the transfer was likely an over-the-counter deal between a large private entity and an institution or government and not a sign of looming sell pressure. Volatility is going to be very low in the coming days, as there are no macro market events that can cause price volatility. FOMC meeting minutes are due Wednesday, and there are going to be US unemployment claims on Thursday, but both are low-volatility events. Nonetheless, the $113,000 to $114,000 price range is the most important level to watch in both scenarios. What follows from there, a sharp correction or a straight continuation, will define the speed of the next leg to $120,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,270.

Their target sits at $0.000015 if PEPE holds above the key support line at $0.0000102. That level has been tested multiple times in recent weeks, demonstrating some buying interest each time prices approached it. Traders warn that slipping below $0.0000102 could derail hopes for the next big leg up. Triangle Formation Signals Tension A recent chart indicates that PEPE is trading within a triangle pattern. Traders track triangles closely because they can lead to rapid moves following a breakout. Currently, PEPE is wedged at the top of this triangle. When trading volume picks up and the token closes over the old resistance line (indicated in red), it could ignite a new wave of buyers. Community Buzz Keeps Meme Coins Alive Meme tokens survive by social fervor, and PEPE has developed a devoted fan base on sites like X. Meme posts and community-led memes have powered previous rallies, prompting new investors to jump aboard. According to reports, continued buzz might be sufficient to initiate another run at least in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details Risks And Rewards In Focus Even if history does rhyme, it doesn&#8217;t often repeat itself. Previous runs had PEPE tank just as severely, losing as much as 95% of profits in one session. Gambling on a 20X spike involves taking wild swings and sudden plunges. Anyone considering coming in at $0.0000102 should have in mind exit points and only risk capital that can be safely lost. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/why-xrp-stands-to-gain-big-from-ripple-rlusd/",
      "summary": "Ripple\u2019s dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has spent the past six months quietly becoming one of the fastest-growing assets in the $160 billion stable-value sector, even though almost all of its issuance still sits on a rival network, not the XRP Ledger. That dichotomy\u201495 percent of the $455 million supply now lives on Ethereum\u2014was the starting point for a lively weekend exchange on X between XRP pundit \u201cCrypto Eri\u201d and sceptics who questioned whether Ripple\u2019s plans would ever benefit the XRP Ledger (XRPL) itself. XRP\u2019s Hidden Advantage? \u201cRipple is a long-game player,\u201d Eri wrote. \u201cIts public statements to integrate smart contracts on the mainnet will eventually position RLUSD on XRPL as a more competitive stablecoin, with faster and cheaper settlements than Ethereum.\u201d The remark landed just days after Ripple switched on its EVM-compatible sidechain, bringing full Ethereum-style smart-contract functionality to XRPL on 30 June 2025. More than 1,400 contracts were deployed in the first week, according to developer telemetry, and the bridge is already live to 80 other chains through Axelar. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts On-chain data underscore the stakes. RLUSD\u2019s circulating supply rose by 47 percent in June alone to $455 million, the fastest pace among major stablecoins, with roughly $390 million now native to Ethereum after a four-fold expansion since January. Only about $65 million remains on XRPL. That imbalance prompted one user to tell Eri that RLUSD\u2019s utility \u201cimpacts ETH more than XRP.\u201d She conceded the point\u2014\u201ccorrect, for now\u201d\u2014but argued demand would migrate once XRPL\u2019s programmability and liquidity deepen. Ripple\u2019s strategy hinges on more than code. On 2 June the company applied to the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a national trust-bank charter. A parallel filing by its subsidiary, Standard Custody &#38; Trust, seeks a Federal Reserve master account so that RLUSD reserves can eventually sit at the central bank rather than a correspondent institution. The timing aligns with the pending GENIUS Act, bipartisan legislation that for the first time would impose a single federal regime on payment-stablecoin issuers. While the bill\u2019s $10 billion-asset threshold means RLUSD could remain under New York oversight for now, the application positions Ripple to graduate into federal supervision voluntarily\u2014a move CEO Brad Garlinghouse has called a \u201cnew (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.\u201d Eri underscored the charter angle in her post: \u201cThe national banking license application, aligned with the GENIUS Act, secures a Federal Reserve master account \u2026 enhancing trust, expanding crypto financial and payment services, and removing the patchwork of state licenses, enabling continued scalability at lower cost.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Breakdown To Next Support Level, Why $2.28 Is Important If the charter is granted and RLUSD begins to migrate on-demand to XRPL, two flywheels favor the native token, analysts say. First, RLUSD remittances on XRPL would pay transaction fees in XRP, turning every dollar of stablecoin volume into incremental demand for the asset Ripple still holds in large quantities. Second, the EVM sidechain lets decentralized-finance builders tap RLUSD liquidity without leaving XRP\u2019s low-cost consensus layer, potentially reversing the flow of users and liquidity that has so far moved toward Ethereum. \u201cThese calculated steps in the $$$$$-dollar stablecoin market give the digital asset XRP enormous potential, but require more time to unfold,\u201d Eri argues. For now, RLUSD\u2019s growth is still driven by Ethereum\u2019s DeFi economy, and sceptics like user \u201csammie\u201d insist \u201cit\u2019s always going to be like this.\u201d Eri\u2019s final reply was succinct: \u201cLet\u2019s see. I know we\u2019ll be touching base often!\u201d That brevity captures both the promise and the uncertainty ahead. Technical rails are in place; regulatory applications are filed. Whether capital, compliance, and market demand will converge quickly enough to shift billions of RLUSD onto XRPL\u2014and in turn lift XRP\u2019s utility\u2014remains the multi-billion-dollar question.
