      "summary": "Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the leading corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), is on the verge of reaching a significant milestone as it approaches the acquisition of 600,000 tokens. In its latest move, the company purchased 4,980 Bitcoin between June 23 and June 29 for an average price of $106,801 each, totaling approximately $531.9 million. This latest purchase has brought the company\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325, acquired for around $42.4 billion. Strategy Shares Surge 4.7% Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s price remaining relatively stable at around $107,000 and $107,500 over the past 24 hours, Strategy&#8217;s shares, MSTR, increased by 4.7% to $402.07 on Monday, reflecting investor confidence in the company&#8217;s financial moves. The value of Strategy&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings now stands at roughly $64 billion. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure\u2014Analyst Says \u2018Fireworks Ahead\u2019 Funding for these latest acquisitions came through the sale of stock under various at-the-market offerings. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer noted that the company&#8217;s Bitcoin yield, which measures the change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to total shares outstanding, was 19.7% between January 1 and June 29. Strategy&#8217;s Chairman, Michael Saylor, who is often regarded as one of Bitcoin&#8217;s most vocal advocates, hinted at the recent purchase in a social media post over the weekend. He stated, \u201cIn 21 years, you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d bought more,\u201d alongside a chart illustrating the performance of Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin portfolio since its initial investment in late 2020, which shows the aggressive purchases that have increased over the past year. Bitcoin Price Hovers Around $107,000 Interestingly, the company had made a smaller purchase of 245 Bitcoins between June 16 and June 22, considerably less than its usual massive acquisitions. For context, Strategy had previously acquired 10,100 Bitcoins in just six days during the period from June 9 to June 15. This shows that while the company often makes large purchases, it can also vary its acquisition strategy based on market conditions. Over the past month, the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has seen a notable volatility spike with prices failing to tackle its current record price of $111,800 reached during last month\u2019s rally.

Since, Bitcoin has managed to endure subsequent price drops, with the most recent plunging BTC toward the $98,000 zone. However, the cryptocurrency has managed to record a 2.4% recovery on the weekly time frame, currently consolidating at $107,000. Originally founded as an enterprise software firm, Strategy has transformed into a leveraged play on Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly owning it. Since August 2020, the company has consistently increased its Bitcoin reserves by selling stock and debt. This has prompted criticism from analysts who believe this could be dangerous if the Bitcoin price drops below the firm\u2019s average buying price.

      "summary": "Nearly three years after the Merge formally switched Ethereum to proof-of-stake on 15 September 2022, a publicly listed Bitcoin miner is adopting the network\u2019s native token as its primary treasury asset. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) on 30 June priced a $250 million private placement of 55,555,556 new shares at $4.50 each and appointed Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as chairman. The company\u2019s SEC filing and press release make the purpose explicit: all net proceeds will be used to acquire and stake ether, a move management likens to Michael Saylor\u2019s now-legendary Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy. Tom Lee Goes Full MicroStrategy On Ethereum Speaking hours later on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Lee framed the pivot as a logical response to the explosive growth of stablecoins, most of which settle on Ethereum. \u201cStablecoins, which is the ChatGPT of crypto, because it\u2019s viral adoption by consumers, businesses, banks and now even Visa,\u201d he said, underscoring why a treasury heavy in ETH could become strategically indispensable. Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake design means that large holders who validate blocks \u201csecure the fidelity of stablecoins,\u201d Lee continued. \u201cWhen Goldman issues a stablecoin and JP Morgan [issues] it on Ethereum as a layer-one blockchain, they\u2019re going to want to secure it by staking Ethereum.\u201d Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs Lee tied the long-term upside to macro numbers the US Treasury itself has started to cite. Stablecoins today hover around $250 billion; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested the figure could hit $2 trillion\u2014a potential ten-fold expansion that, in Lee\u2019s words, would \u201cinsure dollar dominance.\u201d Because Ethereum already underpins more than half of stable-value tokens, a multi-trillion-dollar stablecoin market would translate directly into rising transaction fees for the network and, by extension, higher staking rewards for BitMine\u2019s planned validator clusters. The private-placement syndicate reads like a who\u2019s-who roster from both TradFi and crypto: MOZAYYX led the round, joined by Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group, Diametric Capital and Occam Crest. Closing is expected on or about 3 July, subject to NYSE American approval. BitMine, headquartered in Las Vegas, will immediately deploy the ETH position into staking, giving the miner a yield-bearing balance-sheet asset while reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s security budget. \u201cOne of the key performance metrics for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share,\u201d chief executive Jonathan Bates said in the statement. For investors, the comparison with MicroStrategy is unavoidable but imperfect. Saylor\u2019s company amassed bitcoin under a proof-of-work regime that offers no native yield; BitMine\u2019s ether can generate income through both staking rewards and potential capital-markets transactions collateralized by those staked coins. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation Yet both strategies share a central bet: that a scarce digital asset sitting at the core of global finance will appreciate faster than cash alternatives on a corporate balance sheet. Whether BitMine achieves MicroStrategy-level returns will depend on execution, regulatory clarity for staking, and\u2014most of all\u2014Ethereum\u2019s price path. What is clear, however, is that corporate treasuries are beginning to see ether not merely as \u201cgas\u201d for decentralized applications but as a strategic reserve asset in its own right. From a market-structure vantage, the new treasury model could translate into meaningful price torque for Ether if it scales. MicroStrategy\u2019s serial purchases have now absorbed nearly 600,000 BTC\u2014around 2.8 percent of the 21 million-coin cap\u2014and coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s ascent from roughly $11,000 in August 2020, when the company made its first buy, to more than $107,000 today, a near-ten-fold move. BitMine\u2019s opening salvo\u2014$250 million, or about 100,000 ETH at current prices\u2014represents barely 0.08 percent of Ethereum\u2019s 122 million-coin supply, yet roughly 28 percent of that supply is already locked in staking contracts while net issuance has turned negative post-EIP-1559, shrinking the freely tradable float. If even a handful of additional balance sheets emulate this \u201cETH-as-reserve\u201d playbook, the resulting demand shock could replicate the supply-squeeze dynamics that propelled Bitcoin into six-figure territory.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/analyst-call-bitcoin-crash/",
      "summary": "The past weekend was favorable for Bitcoin as the price was able to rebound from last week\u2019s lows and go on to reclaim $108,000 ahead of the new week. This has boosted market sentiment once again, prompting investors to return to the table. However, as the price continues to sit in the green, one crypto analyst has sounded the alarm that the Bitcoin price may be headed for another crash toward the support area close to $100,000. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Is Imminent In the TradingView analysis, the crypto analyst reveals the reason why the Bitcoin price could dump back downwards is because of mounting resistance. This is because, as the leading cryptocurrency moves toward new all-time highs, there is the possibility of a pushback before it is able to continue its rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidating Below $108,000 But Eyes $115,000 Target In this case, the crypto analyst does expect the Bitcoin price to keep rising. But they see a lot of resistance for the digital asset just above $109,000. More specifically, at $109,500, which is still a ways away from the $112,000 needed to create a new all-time high, the cryptocurrency is expected to meet new resistance and dump back downward. This stiff resistance opens up an opportunity for market shooters to enter into the trade. According to the chart, it is possible for the Bitcoin price to actually move toward the low $100,000s. Currently, there is major support at $102,500, and if the digital asset does lose its footing, this is likely where the bulls will stage their recovery once more. Sweeping For Liquidity At Lower Ranges Another crypto analyst, Riscora, has supported this move with their own analysis, also predicting that a pullback is possible from here. This still boils down to mounting resistance as the Bitcoin price moves toward the possibility of reaching a new all-time high, and budding liquidity rises at the lower levels. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 The analyst explains that as liquidity has now been taken in the higher levels, after Bitcoin hit $108,000, there is bound to be a correction. This time around, they expect the correction to be much deeper given the recent bullish impulse move. The target from her sis a move back into the $107,000 territory, before moving further downward to take on the $106,400 support. Despite the expectation of a price dip, the analyst warns that the Bitcoin price remains overall bullish from here. As the crypto market ushers in the month of July, which is usually bullish for Bitcoin, it is possible that the cryptocurrency does put in a new all-time high this month, seeing as there is less than a 5% move left to beat its current $111,900 peak.

      "summary": "Solana (SOL) has retested a crucial resistance level after recovering the $150 level over the weekend. The surge, fueled by the upcoming launch of a SOL-based staked exchange-traded fund (ETF), has led some analysts to forecast a rally toward the next key target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move Solana Staked ETFs Coming On Wednesday On Monday, Solana\u2019s price soared to a key resistance level following the introduction of \u201cthe first-ever Solana staked crypto ETF in the US.\u201d Rex Shares announced it will launch a Solana-based staked ETF this Wednesday, aiming to offer exposure to SOL and staking rewards. According to the X post, the REX-Osprey ETF will track SOL\u2019s performance while \u201cgenerating yield through on-chain staking,\u201d starting a \u201cnew era of yield-generating crypto exposure.\u201d As a result, Solana climbed to the $160 barrier, which led to nearly $9 million in short positions liquidated on Monday afternoon. Market Watcher Daan Crypto Trades considers Solana \u201cbounced nicely over the weekend\u201d but has yet to turn the Low Timeframe (LTF) trend around. He explained that reclaiming the $159-$167 area is necessary to aim for higher levels. Additionally, the Daily 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are currently located within this range. \u201cI would want to see price trade back above that to start targeting the $180-$200 region again,\u201d he detailed. Nonetheless, the trader questioned whether a Solana spot ETF-driven rally will fuel the cryptocurrency\u2019s run. Notably, multiple investment firms, including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot SOL ETF in the US. According to recent reports, the investment products have a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of being approved in the coming weeks, which has seemingly fueled investors\u2019 expectations of a bullish \u201cSolana Summer.\u201d \u201cThe big question is how much demand there will be,\u201d Daan asserted, noting that Ethereum (ETH) sport ETFs, approved in July 2024, had a disappointing launch and \u201conly started seeing decent inflows about a year later.\u201d SOL Ready For Another Breakout? Following the ETF-fueled breakout, analyst Hardy noted Solana\u2019s \u201cTextbook move, clean breakout, clean retest, and pump,\u201d which could trigger a run toward the $200 barrier. Notably, the cryptocurrency saw a remarkable performance over the weekend, reclaiming the $144-$148 crucial area and breaking past the $150 mark. Amid this performance, the analyst highlighted that Solana had broken out of its local downtrend line after reclaiming the $148 resistance and was retesting the breakout zone. He explained that there is \u201cJuicy liquidity sitting above, ready to be taken,\u201d adding that Solana needed to hold the $150 support to continue its bullish run toward the next target.

      "summary": "Ethereum currently has strong support at $2,200, but one analyst has pointed out that if the level fails, the next region to watch could be $1,160. On-Chain Data Shows Strong Ethereum Demand Zone Near $2,200 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where support lies for Ethereum based on on-chain data. In on-chain analysis, levels are considered as major support/resistance zones if they host the cost basis or acquisition level of a significant part of the ETH supply. The reason behind this lies in the fact that investors are more likely to show some kind of reaction when the retest of their break-even level takes place. This buying/selling is irrelevant to the wider market if only a few holders are having it tested at once, but the story can be different when the retest is of the cost basis of a large amount of them. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the different price levels around the current Ethereum spot price are currently looking in terms of the amount of supply that was purchased at them. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the amount of Ethereum supply contained within the associated price range. It would appear that, out of the ranges listed, the $2,218 to $2,396 levels currently have the largest dot, meaning that they host the most supply. More specifically, this range has the cost basis of 6.28 million addresses, who purchased a total of 67.2 million ETH at its levels. Given this fact, it&#8217;s possible that should a retest of the range occur, investors could show a strong reaction. But what kind of reaction would it be, buying or selling? Well, these investors are in profit right now and usually, such holders are more likely to double down on the asset during declines to their acquisition mark, as they may believe the same price level would turn out to be profitable again in the future. As such, the $2,218 to $2,396 range could end up acting as a strong support level for Ethereum. In the scenario that ETH falls below the lower end of the range around $2,200, however, it may have to rely on support elsewhere. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that all the ranges below are much smaller in terms of supply. The next major support zone lies all the way down at $1,160, where 35.9 million addresses acquired 21.58 million tokens. Naturally, Ethereum doesn&#8217;t have to slip right through to this zone if $2,200 is lost, but if the data is to go by, it does suggest that the coin could have a harder time regaining footing below it. ETH Price Ethereum is holding above the on-chain demand zone for now as its price is floating around $2,475. Featured image from Dall-E, Sentora.com, chart from TradingView.com"
