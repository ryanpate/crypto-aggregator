      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-jump-off-critical-support-level-relief-or-reversal/",
      "summary": "Altcoins have endured years of underperformance as Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market. Despite several short-lived rallies, most altcoins remain far below their previous highs, weighed down by investor skepticism and capital concentration in BTC. However, there are signs that sentiment might be shifting. In recent days, strong altcoins have started to recover, showing resilience as broader market conditions improve. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical setup revealing that the altcoin market is now bouncing off a major support zone. This move has sparked fresh debates among traders and investors. Is this the start of a long-awaited altseason, or merely a temporary relief bounce before further downside? The bounce comes as macroeconomic uncertainty begins to fade and liquidity returns to the crypto market. Still, key resistance levels remain untouched for many projects, and overall confidence in altcoins hasn\u2019t fully returned. While the current setup is promising, confirmation will depend on whether this rally can break above critical levels and sustain higher prices. Altcoins Eye A Breakout As Ethereum Holds The Key Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but sentiment is beginning to shift. Bulls are preparing for an expansive move across the board, with growing anticipation that a breakout could materialize once Ethereum clears its current resistance zone. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a well-defined consolidation range, and altcoins have mirrored this sideways behavior, struggling to gain momentum without a clear signal from the market\u2019s second-largest asset. Carl Runefelt recently shared insights suggesting that the altcoin market is showing signs of life. By analyzing the TOTAL3 chart\u2014which tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014Runefelt highlights that altcoins are bouncing off key support in BTC terms. This bounce could indicate the beginning of a recovery rally, especially if capital rotation from BTC into altcoins accelerates in the coming sessions. Historically, altcoins thrive when Ethereum leads the charge. A confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance zone could ignite broad participation and kickstart a new altseason. The current market structure suggests that many investors are positioning early, anticipating that macroeconomic clarity and market stability will fuel risk-on behavior. However, the rally is not yet confirmed. Bulls still need Ethereum to break out decisively and sustain momentum above recent highs. If that happens, many oversold altcoins could see sharp recoveries and set the stage for a broader market expansion. For now, patience and timing remain key as traders watch ETH and TOTAL3 closely for signals of the next leg up. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves TOTAL3 Chart Shows Key Rebound From Macro Support The TOTAL3 chart, which measures the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is showing early signs of recovery after a sustained period of weakness. As of now, the chart reflects a bounce from the $830 billion level, which aligns closely with the 100-week simple moving average (SMA), currently acting as dynamic support. This level has historically served as a critical pivot zone, especially in mid-cycle consolidations. The market cap sits near $875 billion, still over 40% below the previous cycle\u2019s peak, but with bullish momentum building. The recent weekly candle has posted a strong green body, suggesting renewed interest in the altcoin segment. Volume has also picked up, showing growing confidence among participants as many altcoins recover from deeply oversold conditions. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise Technically, this bounce could signal the beginning of a new macro leg higher, especially if the 50-week SMA is reclaimed and price holds above $900 billion. The overall structure remains constructive, with higher lows forming since late 2022 and price compressing into a potential breakout formation. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-uptrend-intact-but-binance-activity-warns-of-short-term-pullback/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high (ATH) yesterday, climbing to $111,999 on Binance exchange before dipping slightly to around $110,000 at the time of writing. While the broader trend remains bullish, some analysts now anticipate a short-term pullback. Bitcoin Remains Bullish But Some Pullback Expected According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, early warning signs suggest that BTC may face a brief correction. The analyst noted that if momentum doesn\u2019t pick up soon, Bitcoin could struggle to maintain its bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top Binance taker buy/sell volume has shown a noticeable spike in aggressive buy orders &#8211; usually a bullish signal &#8211; but sell volume has also risen in tandem, effectively absorbing most of the demand. Despite this uptick in buy volume, BTC\u2019s price has not responded proportionally, suggesting distribution or selling pressure. For the uninitiated, Binance taker buy/sell volume measures the amount of aggressive buying versus selling on the exchange using market orders. A higher taker buy volume indicates strong buyer interest, while higher taker sell volume signals stronger selling pressure. In addition, Binance open interest has surged during the recent price rally, signalling an influx of leveraged positions. While rising open interest can support further gains, the subdued price reaction raises concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s short-term strength. Meanwhile, funding rates have stayed mostly neutral throughout the rally. However, the most recent push to a new ATH saw BTC&#8217;s funding rates turn slightly positive, hinting at increasing long exposure and renewed bullish sentiment. The breakout also triggered significant short liquidations, likely fuelling a short squeeze. Data from Coinglass shows that over the past 24 hours, $521 million in positions were liquidated &#8211; $448 million of which were shorts. Market Needs A Breather Before Climbing Higher Concluding, the CryptoQuant contributor noted that despite the emerging signs of caution, Bitcoin\u2019s overall bullish structure remains intact. However, the market is now seeing the early signs of a potential short-term pullback, especially due to the spike-driven nature of the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Other analysts share a similar outlook for BTC. For example, crypto analyst Christian Chifoi suggested that the current price action may be a deceptive move designed to trap bullish traders &#8211; potentially pushing BTC down to $97,000 before the final rally begins. That said, the recent weakness observed in the US Dollar Index (DXY) has fuelled hopes for a capital reallocation to alternative assets, including BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $110,885, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/illegal-to-short-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action has shown intense strength in recent days to finally bounce fully from the weakness in late June. After briefly dipping into the low $108,000 range in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin managed to surge to a new all-time high of $112,022. According to data from Coinglass, this move was enough to cause over $470 million in short liquidations across the crypto market. Bitcoin&#8217;s latest price behavior has sparked a shift in sentiment and aligns with the argument that the window for shorting may have officially closed. According to crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, it is now effectively \u201cillegal\u201d to short Bitcoin. New Bitcoin Impulse May Have Already Started Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto noted that it is now illegal to short Bitcoin. This comment comes alongside a 24-hour period of intense price activity, with on-chain data showing a trading volume of $60.15 billion. Related Reading: Institutions Buy Bitcoin In Record Numbers, But Why Is Price Still Below $111,900 ATH? CrediBULL Crypto posted a detailed chart and technical analysis on X, explaining why he believes shorting Bitcoin is now a dangerous strategy. Notably, his analysis is based on the Elliott Wave count on the 8-hour candlestick timeframe chart. His previous wave analysis reflects two possible scenarios. The first involves a brief rejection above $110,000 followed by a corrective pullback toward the $102,000 zone, an area he highlighted as a key daily demand level. The outcome would be a sideways consolidation before the next major upward impulse. However, he has since acknowledged that Bitcoin may have already begun its next major leg up, which is the second scenario. This scenario bypasses the corrective phase in the first scenario entirely. As the analyst phrased it, \u201cthere is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun.\u201d In either scenario, CrediBULL\u2019s commentary stresses that the downside from current levels is limited, and shorting Bitcoin now is equivalent to fighting strong upward momentum. Why Shorting Bitcoin Now Is A Dangerous Bet It\u2019s now illegal to short Bitcoin. Not in the literal legal sense, but because Bitcoin&#8217;s current structure no longer supports bearish bets. The current setup is one of a continuation above $111,000 in the coming days. If Bitcoin does clear the $111,000 to $112,000 range with enough conviction, it would confirm a vertical rise into wave 3 of a new Elliott impulse cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Interestingly, the price target for this Wave 3 is around $130,000. A correction may follow from that level to form an impulse Wave 4 before Bitcoin enters another strong bullish leg. Then, finally, the most bullish scenario places Bitcoin on a final Wave 5 movement to $150,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,270. The downside is currently limited, and the focus now should be on identifying long opportunities rather than attempting to short what may be the early stages of another explosive rally.
