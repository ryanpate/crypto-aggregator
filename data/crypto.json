      "summary": "Top analyst Aksel Kibar (CMT) believes Bitcoin is approaching a decisive moment on the weekly chart. In a post shared on 9 July 2025, the veteran technician noted that BTC/USD is \u201cholding right at the pattern boundary.\u201d The annotated chart he released\u2014covering Bitstamp weekly prices back to mid-2022\u2014shows the cryptocurrency compressing directly beneath a horizontal resistance band at $109,000, the neckline of what he labels a six-month head-and-shoulders (H&#38;S) continuation formation. Bitcoin Poised For $141,300 Kibar\u2019s chart first revisits the basing sequence that reversed the 2022 bear cycle. A textbook inverse head-and-shoulders bottom completed in early-2023, with troughs at roughly $17,600 (left shoulder), $15,500 (head) and $19,500 (right shoulder). The breakout above the neckline sent Bitcoin to $31,400. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? Immediately thereafter, price stalled in a six-month rectangle bounded by $25,000 support and $31,400 resistance. The eventual topside resolution propelled the market to the rectangle\u2019s implied target of $38,000, validating two consecutive classical projections in less than a year. Afterwards, the BTC price grinded higher. Below $73,700, BTC consolidated in a falling wedge, ending with a breakout toward $109,000. From that point, the initial pullback bottomed at $91,200, creating what Kibar designates as the left shoulder. A deeper descent to $76,500 carved out the head. Then, the Bitcoin price formed the right shoulder at $101,500, echoed by the blue bowl-shaped arc on the chart. Throughout this structure the neckline at $109,000 remained intact, acting as a clear demarcation between consolidation and fresh highs. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern spans roughly half a year, matching the analyst\u2019s \u201c6-month-long\u201d annotation. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000\u2014Is History Repeating? Using the orthodox H&#38;S continuation rule\u2014adding the vertical distance from the head ($73,700) to the neckline ($109,000) to the breakout level\u2014Kibar derives a price objective of $141,300. He notes in an X reply that this target is separate from the earlier $137,000 objective, which came from a larger cup-with-handle on the monthly scale. In other words, the shorter-term weekly pattern now projects modestly higher than the longer-term structure. At press time Bitcoin, Bitcoin traded near $111,000, surpassing the neckline. However, from a technician\u2019s standpoint, the breakout still needs to confirm with the weekly close. Confirmation requires a decisive weekly settlement north of the $109,000 neckline. As Kibar notes: \u201cBreakout needs to take place with a long white candle, similar to previous pattern completions. There should be no hesitation.\u201d Invalidation would emerge on a weekly close back below the most recent swing-low support at $101,500; deeper failure beneath $91,2000 would unravel the pattern entirely. For now, Bitcoin sits at the fulcrum of its six-month equilibrium. A weekly candle or two should reveal whether the largest digital asset can convert yet another classical chart formation into a measured move\u2014this time toward mid-six-figure territory.

      "summary": "Ethereum surged over 5% yesterday, pushing past the key $2,700 level and signaling renewed strength across the altcoin market. After weeks of sideways action and uncertainty, this move marks a small but significant breakout, reigniting bullish sentiment among investors and traders. The breakout comes as Bitcoin continues to consolidate below its all-time highs, allowing ETH and other altcoins to take the lead. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape Market participants are closely watching Ethereum\u2019s price action, as its movements often set the tone for the broader altcoin space. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical view highlighting that ETH is once again trading at the top of its recent range. A breakout above this level could confirm the beginning of a larger expansion phase for altcoins. With bullish momentum building and Ethereum holding strong above reclaimed support levels, traders are becoming increasingly confident that the altcoin market may be on the verge of a broader breakout. However, key resistance still lies ahead, and the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum has the strength to continue higher and lead a new leg up in the crypto cycle. Ethereum Trades at Range Highs: Breakout Looms Ethereum has spent the past several weeks consolidating in a well-defined range between approximately $2,400 and $2,800, a structure that began forming in early May. Despite short-term volatility, ETH has held key support levels, suggesting that bulls remain in control. Now, with price action pushing toward the upper boundary of the range once again, the market is watching closely to see whether Ethereum can break through resistance and initiate a sustained rally. The broader macroeconomic backdrop has shifted in favor of risk assets. In the US, strong labor market data and wage growth have helped ease concerns of an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, the resolution of several global geopolitical tensions has reduced uncertainty, allowing markets to stabilize. This supportive environment could give Ethereum the fuel it needs to attempt a breakout. Ted Pillows recently highlighted that Ethereum is now trading at the range highs again \u2014 a level that has repeatedly capped price advances in recent months. According to Pillow, a confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance would likely trigger renewed momentum for ETH and potentially spark a broader move across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves $2,800 Resistance Now In Sight Ethereum is showing renewed strength as it breaks out of a multi-week consolidation range, with the latest 12-hour candle closing above $2,760. The price action has decisively reclaimed the $2,700 level and is now testing the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This breakout is supported by a clear surge in volume, confirming bullish momentum. The 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages are all trending upwards and currently sit well below the current price, a strong technical sign of sustained momentum. ETH has moved above all three key SMAs, confirming that bulls are in control in the short to medium term. Notably, this is the highest ETH has traded since early June, and the candle structure resembles a classic continuation breakout setup. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise A successful daily close above $2,800 would open the door for an expansion toward the $3,000 level and potentially higher if momentum holds. However, the key now lies in whether buyers can sustain this move without immediate rejection at resistance. If ETH can hold above $2,700 and build support, the breakout could serve as a launchpad for altcoins, especially as Ethereum often leads broader market moves.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/real-crypto-bull-run-just-beginning-analyst/",
      "summary": "In a livestream broadcast on X, independent market technician Kevin, known online as @Kev_Capital_TA, argued that crypto markets are only now entering what he called \u201cthe real bull run,\u201d pointing to a confluence of technical signals, macroeconomic data and inter-market correlations that he believes have not been fully appreciated by traders. The Real Bull Run Starts Here Kevin placed particular emphasis on the behavior of Tether dominance (USDT.D), the share of crypto market capitalization held in the dollar-pegged stablecoin. The analyst displayed two long-term logarithmic USDT.D charts, each showing an initial sharp decline followed by what he described as a \u201crising channel slash bear flag.\u201d In both 2024 and the present structure, the measured-move target of the pattern sits at 3.70 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s really astonishing how this is kind of attempting to play out,\u201d he said, stressing that any sustainable rally in risk assets will require that level to be reached. \u201cThe two key words that are going to be the most important words over the next couple of weeks are follow through.\u201d Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds \u2013 Details He then overlaid a macro descending triangle on a separate two-week USDT.D chart dating back to March 2020. Each time the two-week Stochastic RSI crossed downward, the dominance metric fell sharply, coinciding with periods of strength in Bitcoin and altcoins. The latest cross, now curling lower, again targets 3.70 percent. If that support were to give way, Kevin allowed, a deeper slide toward \u201cthe two-percent handle\u201d could mark a \u201cpeak bull market\u201d phase\u2014though he cautioned against speculating that far ahead. The technical discussion broadened to Bitcoin\u2019s hash-ribbon indicator, which tracks miner capitulation and recovery. Historically, weekly \u201cbuy\u201d signals have preceded 40 to 100 percent upside moves within nine weeks, with what Kevin called a \u201c100 percent hit rate\u201d over eight years of back-testing. Kevin linked the on-chain data to macro conditions. Citing the real-time inflation gauge \u201cTruthflation,\u201d he highlighted a 1.66 percent reading\u2014below the Federal Reserve\u2019s nominal 2 percent target\u2014and falling import prices, both of which, he argued, increase the odds of an imminent shift to easier policy. \u201cIf Truthflation stays below 2 percent, you\u2019re going to get the easing you want,\u201d he said, predicting that markets would price in an end to quantitative tightening ahead of any official announcement. \u201cRetail traders are becoming more educated than they\u2019ve ever been.\u2026 The market will sniff out rate cuts coming.\u201d Altcoin capital rotation formed a second pillar of the bullish thesis. Ethereum\u2019s market-share chart, he said, had been basing at 2019-2020 lows, with monthly MACD, Stochastic RSI and Market Cipher signals all turning up. Early reallocations into ETH-beta names such as Chainlink and Uniswap are already \u201cup 60 percent\u201d from their accumulation zones, he claimed, framing the moves as the foothills of a broader run. Nonetheless, he warned viewers not to wait for central-bank confirmation: \u201cDon\u2019t be the person sitting on the sidelines waiting for Powell to come out saying QT is over.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Turning to Bitcoin itself, Kevin acknowledged that the benchmark still faces substantial resistance. Price must clear the March record, then the $112,000\u2013$116,000 range and, ultimately, $120,000 before \u201cthin air\u201d opens a path to $140,000\u2013$150,000. Similarly, the \u201ctotal three\u201d index\u2014market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014needs a daily close above $877 billion and, crucially, the yellow-shaded resistance band that has capped rallies five times since February. Only then, he argued, would a new all-time high for the broader alt-basket come into view. Despite the optimism, Kevin repeatedly returned to the notion that conviction without confirmation is premature. \u201cWe need to see real deal price action,\u201d he said, noting that Bitcoin\u2019s daily RSI has not reached the 90-plus \u201ceuphoria\u201d zone since 2017.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-inverse-head-shoulders/",
      "summary": "XRP has been one of the most-watched altcoins recently, with multiple developments emerging for its parent company, Ripple. However, while Ripple has seen a lot of positives, XRP has continued to struggle when it comes to price. Amid the selling, bulls have put up an impressive fight to hold the support above $2.2 for the time being. This has led to the formation of a new inverse head and shoulders pattern that could signal a reversal is coming. Analyst Highlights Bullish Formation For XRP Price Crypto analyst TheSignalyst, in a new analysis, showed that the XRP price has begun another bullish formation. This time around, it is the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern that often precedes a surge for an asset. Not only has this formation come at a critical junction, it happened while bulls have maintained strong support levels. Related Reading: Altcoins Reclaim Trendline That Led To 2021 Explosion, Will History Repeat Itself? Through the market downtrend, the XRP price has been able to hold above $1.75 and $2, which the analyst points out as a major level. The return to this support level has brought a fresh wave of bullishness, and the XRP price could be ready for another uptrend from here. Presently, all eyes are on this support level, and TheSignalyst revealed that if XRP is able to hold this level, then the rally could be in motion. They point to the green neckline, which is shown in the chart as sitting just above $2.3, and this is the resistance that needs to be broken for the price to rally in the short term. For the long term, the analyst suggests that a clean break above the $2.66 level is needed. This is what would provide confirmation for a bullish continuation. If the setup holds, then the analyst puts the top of formation as high as $3.3 in the long term. Analysts Predict Higher Prices The calls for higher prices for XRP have grown louder, especially as investors have begun to make their bets once again. Analyst Crypto Virtuos pointed out that the XRP trading volume saw a notable uptick of 125% in a 24-hour period as interest ballooned once again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs? Analyst Explains The 2 Options Amid this rise in momentum, the crypto analyst, just like TheSignalyst, also explained that $2.3 is the hurdle that is holding the XRP price back now. Therefore, the cryptocurrency does need to overtake this level if it is to see a continuation of the uptrend. At the time of writing, the XRP price is still trending below $2.3, with sellers showing signs of exhaustion. Once the selling stops, then the bulls could trigger another upward wave to retest the resistance at $2.3 once again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price movement remains in focus as it continues to consolidate just below its previous all-time high. Despite a brief surge that brought it within range of its $111,000 peak, the asset has struggled to establish a breakout. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,927, representing a 0.2% increase over the past 24 hours. The persistence of this consolidation phase comes amid growing market discussions around spot and derivatives behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut\u2014What You Need To Know Binance Spot-Perpetual Delta Reflects Cautious Leverage One of the more notable on-chain observations comes from CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, who analyzed the prolonged negative delta between spot and perpetual prices on Binance. According to the analyst, this delta has remained in negative territory since December 2024. That means the spot price of Bitcoin has consistently traded above the perpetual futures price on Binance, an unusual structure during what appears to be a bullish market trend. \u201cWhen the delta flipped negative last December, Bitcoin had just marked a then-ATH,\u201d BorisVest noted. He explained that this divergence signaled an aggressive buildup of long positions in the perpetual market, just before Bitcoin corrected to $74,000. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs recently, the delta still hasn\u2019t reversed. \u201cThe sustained gap shows that leveraged traders have yet to commit to the rally in full,\u201d he added. This trend could indicate a phase of accumulation in the spot market, which historically precedes stronger price movements. The analyst also warned that when perpetual prices eventually flip above spot prices, it may signal a shift toward a more speculative environment. In such scenarios, sudden price corrections could occur if long positions are unwound rapidly. Traders monitoring the spot-perpetual relationship can potentially use this as a signal to adjust their risk exposure. Dollar Weakness May Signal Tailwinds for Bitcoin Another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a macroeconomic trend that could further influence Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, the weakening US dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the value of the dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies, is currently trading at its most significant deviation below its 200-day moving average in over two decades. This decline coincides with rising US debt levels and has historically aligned with strength in risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Darkfost pointed out that when the dollar loses its traditional safe-haven appeal, capital often flows toward alternative assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs? Analyst Explains The 2 Options \u201cHistorical data shows that these periods have consistently benefited Bitcoin,\u201d the analyst stated.
