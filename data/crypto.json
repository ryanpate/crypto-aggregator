That brings the year-to-date haul to $15 billion. Even holiday trading lulls and global jitters haven\u2019t stalled the momentum. Investors seem to be treating this pullback as a chance to buy, not a reason to sell. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead The Pack According to CoinShares data, Bitcoin pulled in $1.114 billion this week alone. It has now logged $2.37 billion month-to-date and $12.7 billion YTD, across nearly $152 billion in assets under management. Ethereum chipped in with its ninth straight week of gains, adding $124 million in weekly inflows. That pushed its month-to-date total past $1 billion and its YTD figure to $2.43 billion, across $14.29 billion of assets. Investors aren\u2019t scooping up bearish bets, either: short Bitcoin products saw just $1.4 million in outflows this week and $8.7 million since January. Altcoins See Mixed Results Solana attracted $2.80 million this week and nearly $3 million month-to-date, lifting its YTD flows to almost $86 million. XRP pulled in $2.70 million weekly and $10.55 million month-to-date, taking its year-long total to $268 million across $1.205 billion in managed assets. But funds that package multiple tokens bled $5.76 million this week and almost $17 million for the month\u2014though they\u2019re still up $58 million in 2025. Other altcoin vehicles are in rough shape, with $509 million of outflows since January. Regional Trends Highlight The US The United States led global flows with $1.25 billion in weekly inflows. That\u2019s $3.37 billion month-to-date and $14.30 billion YTD, out of $135 billion under management. Canada added nearly $21 million this week and $42.8 million for June. Germany chipped in almost $11 million while Australia booked $16.6 million. Brazil bucked the trend with $9 million of outflows this week and $26.4 million in June, but it\u2019s still about $34.8 million ahead for the year. Smaller Tokens Struggle For Attention Some newer names drew mixed reactions. Sui saw $8.5 million drain this week despite $3.3 million of gains so far in June. Litecoin eked out $0.21 million in weekly inflows and clos to $6 million YTD. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free\u2014Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Cardano and Chainlink grabbed $0.34 million and $0.6 million this week, respectively.

Institutions are still finding reasons to back crypto even as global events and holiday thins slow trading. Total weekly flows hit $1.23 billion, taking June\u2019s total to $3.38 billion and the year\u2019s to $15 billion, across $176 billion in overall assets. Based on these trends, big spenders aren\u2019t ready to abandon digital tokens. They\u2019re treating pullbacks like offers they can\u2019t pass up.

      "summary": "After a brief drop to $98,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered and is now trading above $101,000 at the time of writing. While concerns about a potential double top persist, on-chain data has yet to show any major warning signs. Bitcoin Undergoing Healthy Consolidation According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Avocado_onchain, despite broader market sentiment turning bearish, BTC has not yet displayed any significant red flags. In fact, the cryptocurrency still appears to be in a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Pull 4,500 BTC From Binance, Hinting At Incoming Rally Notably, the 30-day moving average (MA) of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicates that long-term holders are continuing to hold onto their BTC rather than selling. This suggests that investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s potential for further upside in the near term. For the uninitiated, the 30-day MA Binary CDD smooths out daily fluctuations to show how frequently long-term Bitcoin holders are moving their coins over a month. A lower value suggests strong holding behavior and accumulation, while a higher value may indicate distribution or selling pressure from experienced holders. The analyst noted in a previous analysis that when Bitcoin\u2019s Binary CDD exceeded 0.8, it was typically followed by a steep correction. However, this time, the indicator has peaked around 0.6 and is now on the decline &#8211; suggesting the market is far from overheating. They added: Although the data may not align perfectly from cycle to cycle, this moderation below 0.8 still implies the market may be entering a consolidation period, and further price or time correction could follow. The analyst emphasized that this indicator does not signal the end of the bull run. Rather &#8211; similar to the previous two market phases &#8211; Bitcoin could be following a &#8220;staircase-like movement,&#8221; where periods of consolidation are followed by a strong upward leg. They concluded that BTC historically tends to rally when market attention fades and sentiment remains quiet. Therefore, the current period of low volatility could be a precursor to Bitcoin\u2019s next major move to the upside. Are BTC Bears In Trouble? While the current bearish sentiment may have raised hopes for further price pullback for the largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap, both technical and on-chain indicators suggest otherwise.

      "summary": "As volatility engulfs the cryptocurrency market amid war tensions, on-chain data shows that the Bitcoin short-term holders are selling at a loss. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Just Made Large Exchange Inflows At A Loss In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about how the Bitcoin short-term holders have reacted to the price volatility that has come alongside rising tensions in the Middle East following US strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The other side of the network, the holders with a holding time greater than 155 days, are termed as the long-term holders (LTHs). The former group contains the new entrants and low conviction holders, who generally panic easily whenever some change occurs in the market. On the other hand, the latter cohort includes the veterans of the market, who tend to sit tight through crashes and rallies alike. As such, given the recent sharp price action that has occurred in the sector, the STHs are likely to have made some moves. And indeed, on-chain data would confirm so. The above chart, shared by the analyst, shows the data for the profit and loss exchange deposit transactions that the STHs as a whole are making. Investors usually transfer to these centralized platforms when they want to sell, so inflows going to them can provide hints about whether selling is elevated or not. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the loss transactions going to the exchanges from this cohort have amounted to 14,700 BTC, which, although lower than the two major capitulation events from the past couple of months, is significant. Thus, it would appear that some of the STHs have reacted to the news by exiting the market, even if it means taking a loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move\u2014Will It Be Up Or Down? It&#8217;s also apparent from the chart that the profitable transfers have remained relatively low at 3,100 BTC. This is likely down to the fact that the STHs are left with little profit following the price decline, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. In the chart, the trend of the STH Realized Price is displayed. This indicator keeps track of the Bitcoin cost basis or acquisition level of the average STH. During the crash, the price almost retested the line, and even after the rebound, it remains close to it, meaning the profit margin for the cohort is still tight. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $101,300, down over 5% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "The BNB Paradox: Bearish Breakdown Meets Bullish Flag, Which Will Prevail?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-bearish-breakdown/",
      "summary": "BNB finds itself at a pivotal crossroads where conflicting signals collide \u2014 a bearish breakdown challenging key support levels, yet a bullish flag pattern hints at a potential upward surge. This paradox leaves traders and investors weighing which force will ultimately dominate the market\u2019s next move. As pressure mounts from both sides, understanding the technical nuances behind this tug-of-war becomes crucial to anticipating BNB\u2019s trajectory in the near term. BNB Faces Pressure From Key Technical Levels Analyzing the BNBUSD setup on the M30 timeframe, Thomas Anderson in an X post highlighted that the price is currently testing the yellow support line at $626.95, following a decisive drop below the cyan price line at $633.99. This breakdown has shifted short-term sentiment, suggesting that sellers are beginning to exert stronger control over the price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Breakout Could Trigger ATH Rally Repeat \u2013 Is $730 The Next Stop? According to Anderson, the 200 MA (red line), positioned between $642 and $645, is now acting as a dynamic resistance zone overhead. With price trading below this moving average, any attempts at recovery may face immediate rejection. He also pointed out that the H1 chart confirms the ongoing bearish momentum, with the price continuing to trade below both the cyan level and the 200 MA. This alignment between the M30 and H1 timeframes strengthens the case for further downside movement, especially if the current support at $626.95 fails to hold. Until buyers manage to reclaim key resistance levels, the overall outlook remains weak, and traders should keep an eye on how the price behaves around the current support to gauge the next likely move. BNB\u2019s Price Outlook Strengthened By Bullish Continuation Signal Despite the bearish outlook presented by Thomas Anderson, eL Zippo expressed a more optimistic stance in his latest X tweet regarding BNB. He believes that BNB still has the potential to rise in value, challenging the prevailing negative sentiment around its recent price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Eyes Comeback: Can It Regain Momentum and Rally Higher? EL Zippo\u2019s view is supported by the formation of a bullish flag pattern on the chart. This pattern is widely recognized as a continuation signal, indicating that the asset may resume its prior upward trend after a period of consolidation. For eL Zippo, the presence of this structure suggests that BNB could be setting up for another leg higher if market conditions align. At the time of writing, BNB was trading around the $623 mark, reflecting steady price action. The asset\u2019s market capitalization stood at approximately $87.7 billion, signaling strong investor interest. Additionally, BNB recorded a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $1.8 billion, with price and volume showing percentage gains of 2.11% and 13.22%, respectively\u2014an indication of renewed activity and positive sentiment in the market.
