      "summary": "Brewing tensions between Israel and Iran have triggered global de-risking across risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). The top cryptocurrency by market cap is down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. That said, technical indicators still point toward a potential new all-time high (ATH) for BTC in the coming months. Bitcoin Tracing The ABCD Pattern According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, BTC appears to be following the ABCD pattern. The analyst noted that Bitcoin is currently trading within a wedge formation and could target as high as $137,000 if it breaks out. For the uninitiated, the ABCD pattern is a classic chart setup with four points and three legs &#8211; AB, BC, and CD &#8211; where AB and CD are typically equal in length, and BC serves as the retracement. It helps identify potential reversal zones and signals when a price move may be losing momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance \u2013 A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Several other technical indicators also point to a potential new ATH for BTC. For instance, crypto analyst Crypto Caesar shared the following 4-hour Bitcoin chart highlighting a bullish double bottom pattern that suggests BTC is primed for recovery. Fellow crypto commentator Jelle identified a cup and handle pattern on the daily BTC chart. Jelle shared the following chart showing that BTC has already formed the &#8220;cup&#8221; and is now beginning to shape the &#8220;handle,&#8221; which typically precedes a sharp upward move. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn the Trader pointed to the Hash Ribbons &#8211; an on-chain indicator historically associated with major rallies. Merlijn shared the following BTC daily chart, noting that the last four appearances of this signal preceded strong Bitcoin uptrends. To explain, Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that uses Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages (MA) to spot miner capitulation and recovery. A bullish signal appears when the short-term average crosses above the long-term one. Are BTC Bears Regaining Ground? Although BTC remains above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, some concerning signs are beginning to emerge. The cryptocurrency was recently rejected from the $110,000 resistance level again, giving bears temporary control. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed\u2014Next Stop: $170,000 Similarly, on-chain data shows that long-term holders are beginning to exit the Bitcoin market which retail investors are starting to join in. Such dynamics are typically observed during the late phase of a bull cycle. In parallel, short-term holders are showing signs of declining confidence in BTC, as reflected in recent on-chain activity. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $105,568, down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Featured image with Unsplash, charts from X and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/a-rare-bitcoin-signal-is-flashing-could-the-bull-run-just-be-getting-started/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin&#8217;s market price has experienced renewed downward pressure, falling to just under $106,000 in the last 24 hours. This marks a 1.8% dip over the past day and places the asset approximately 6% below its all-time high of over $111,000 reached last month. While the correction is not severe compared to historical volatility, it highlights ongoing uncertainty in the market as BTC consolidates near record highs without sustained upward momentum. One metric drawing attention amid this price movement is the Puell Multiple, a tool used to evaluate whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to miner income. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed\u2014Next Stop: $170,000 Bitcoin Puell Multiple Suggests Miner Revenues Have Yet to Catch Up CryptoQuant analyst Gaah highlighted that while prices recently surged above $108,000, the Puell Multiple remains below 1.40, a level typically associated with discounted or non-euphoric market phases. This decoupling between BTC price and miner revenue offers insight into how recent gains may be more demand-driven than organically supported by on-chain mining fundamentals. The Puell Multiple measures the daily issuance of BTC in USD terms relative to its 365-day moving average. Historically, readings below 1.0 are seen during market bottoms or accumulation phases, indicating undervaluation. Gaah points out that current readings hovering around 1.40 suggest miner profitability is still lagging, even as the asset trades near historic highs. This pattern contrasts with previous bull cycles where high prices were often accompanied by elevated miner earnings, driven by both network activity and block rewards. This disparity may be due in part to the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. While halving events typically drive price appreciation through reduced supply, they simultaneously put downward pressure on miner revenue. In this case, despite a climb in market price, the halving\u2019s impact continues to suppress income for miners, implying that the price increase has not yet been accompanied by the kind of broader economic expansion that would traditionally drive a full-fledged bull market. Potential for Continued Growth as Institutional Forces Drive Demand Gaah also points to the possibility that external factors may be playing a more dominant role in driving recent price action. These include increasing institutional inflows through spot Bitcoin ETFs, as well as a tighter circulating supply as long-term holders reduce active selling. These forces could be supporting price without necessarily boosting miner profitability in the short term, especially if the uptick is concentrated in secondary market demand rather than new BTC issuance. The current environment may signal a unique window for participants analyzing Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation. A high market price combined with conservative fundamentals suggests the market is not yet in a speculative excess phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? If miner revenues eventually rise in line with growing demand, driven by either increased transaction fees or broader network usage, it could support further upside. As such, both technical and fundamental indicators may continue to evolve in the coming months, offering a clearer view of whether the current cycle has more room to run.

      "summary": "A fresh XRP/BTC chart released on 12 June by the market technician known as Dr. Cat has injected new controversy into one of crypto\u2019s most stubborn trading pairs. The analyst, posting to X, argues that despite a bruising six-week slide, conditions still favour an eventual breakout for XRP that would leave Bitcoin lagging. He assigns the scenario a formidable 70 percent probability. XRP Vs. Bitcoin: 70% Chance Of Breakout, But When? At the heart of Dr. Cat\u2019s thesis is the 2,041-satoshi level, where three separate Ichimoku timeframes\u2014monthly, bi-monthly and tri-monthly\u2014intersect. \u201cThe price keeps eating support after support with no reaction from bulls at all as if supports don\u2019t exist,\u201d he concedes, but he stresses that this specific shelf is \u201cthe most important support.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Could Crash To $1.55 Before Explosive Surge, Analyst Warns Candles on the attached one-month chart already hover fractionally below the line; a decisive monthly close beneath it, he warns, would flip the three-day structure fully bearish and scatter the pair into unpredictable, possibly chaotic ranges. Even so, the strategist insists history is on the side of XRP bulls. \u201cPrice has spent years performing very well and coiling up with higher lows for this attack now,\u201d he writes, framing the past twelve quarters as a prolonged accumulation that has never surrendered its series of macro higher lows. That coiling, he believes, will allow XRP to mount at least a \u201cminor \u2026 attack in August\u201d toward the 3,000-satoshi region\u2014roughly a 45 percent appreciation from current levels\u2014and perhaps fuel a &#8220;much bigger attack&#8221; once the broader market cycle matures. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The optimism is not unqualified. Dr. Cat calculates a 30 percent chance of a complete flop if 2,041 sats fails on a monthly-close basis. Under that bearish branch, the cross could slice toward 1,800 \u2013 1,900 sats, attempt a feeble rebound, or continue a \u201cslow bleed all the way down to the bottom of the range where it started the monster move.\u201d In such a setback, he would not expect the long-anticipated \u201cmonster bullish move\u201d until Q4 2025 at the earliest. For the moment, therefore, the market hangs on a single number. Hold above 2,041 and Dr. Cat sees a clear shot at outperforming Bitcoin\u2014first modestly, then dramatically. Slip beneath it, and the road map dissolves into what he bluntly calls an \u201cunpredictable/choppy\u201d expanse. Either way, XRP traders now know exactly where the cycle\u2019s pivot resides and precisely how thin the margin for error has become. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1287.

According to reports, the beta version of Shib Alpha Layer went live on June 12, 2025. It\u2019s made in partnership with ElderLabs, and it got built without any VC backing. Now users can test it before the full launch. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Shib Alpha Layer Beta Launch Based on reports, the Shib Alpha Layer brings all the separate rollups in the ecosystem under one hood. You won\u2019t need to jump from bridge to bridge. You transact as if you\u2019re on a single chain, even though dozens of rollups run beneath the surface. The project reached beta in record time, and the team says they did it all with their own funds. User Friendly Experience Users can pay fees in SHIB, BONE, or any token they hold. That cuts out the problem of having to swap tokens just to cover gas. You\u2019ll also get near\u2011instant finality, so transactions show up almost right away. Those features may seem small, but they could pull in people who find current rollup setups clunky and slow. Shiba Inu: Security And Privacy Features Shib Alpha Layer uses ZAMA\u2019s Fully Homomorphic Encryption. That lets smart contracts run on encrypted data, so the logic stays private. It\u2019s rare to see FHE live in a crypto network, but the beta is already up and running. Security audits have been promised before the public release, which should ease some worries about bugs or hacks. Today we flip the script. For years we\u2019ve been called \u201cjust a meme,\u201d spammed with Wen Shibarium?, and drowned in FUD from bots, burnt deadweight ex-team but instead of arguing, we shipped.

According to lead developer Kaal Dhairya, every rollup becomes an L3 network, picking up the security that Shibarium offers. Future updates will open up rollup deployment to everyone and boost multi\u2011chain links. Instant bridging is on the roadmap, too, so moving assets between chains could happen in a click. READ THIS: https://t.co/zZcjV0VhHv \u2014 Shytoshi Kusama\u2122 (@ShytoshiKusama) June 13, 2025 The team\u2019s main coder, Kaal Dhairya, pointed out that early critics called SHIB a joke coin. They\u2019d ask \u201cWen Shibarium?\u201d and spread fear, uncertainty and doubt. He said those jibes didn\u2019t slow them down. Instead, they focused on building.

      "summary": "After a volatile but bullish start to June, Solana (SOL) is now facing strong selling pressure amid rising global uncertainty. The sudden escalation in the Middle East\u2014triggered by Israel\u2019s recent strike on Iran\u2014has sparked market-wide volatility, prompting a flight to safety and a pullback across risk assets. Solana, which had been showing momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, has dropped over 15% since June 11, erasing much of its early-month gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History \u2013 Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally As macro risks continue to rise, the altcoin market remains vulnerable to further downside. SOL is now approaching a critical technical level, and a breakdown could signal deeper losses if global tensions persist. Top analyst Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now re-testing a key daily demand zone, a level that previously supported bullish continuation. If this area fails to hold, Solana could revisit lower support levels seen earlier this year. For now, traders are watching closely to see if buyers step in to defend the zone or if further conflict will fuel more risk-off behavior. The next few days will be critical in determining whether SOL can bounce or if the broader market downturn intensifies. Solana Re-Tests Key Support As Market Tensions Mount Solana is standing below key levels, retracing after a brief rally attempt earlier this week. The asset had spent several days consolidating beneath the $170 level, failing to break above resistance as selling pressure intensified amid rising global tensions. Now, with the broader market on edge following the Israel\u2013Iran conflict escalation, SOL finds itself back at a critical support zone. Bulls remain cautiously optimistic, encouraged by the broader market\u2019s resilience and the potential for Bitcoin and Ethereum to regain strength. However, caution dominates sentiment as Solana, like most altcoins, still trades significantly below its all-time high near $260. The current environment of geopolitical risk and macroeconomic uncertainty has suppressed momentum in the altcoin space, making support levels all the more important. Cheds highlighted in a recent update that Solana is now re-testing a key daily demand zone around the $145 level. This zone has previously acted as a launchpad for bullish moves, and holding above it could provide the structure needed for a new leg higher. However, failure to maintain this level might open the door for further downside, with the next major support below $130. For now, all eyes are on how Solana reacts around $145. A solid bounce with increased volume could attract short-term buyers looking to ride a potential recovery. But with global markets rattled by uncertainty, the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether this demand zone becomes a springboard\u2014or a trapdoor. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support \u2013 Can Bulls Defend This Level? SOL Price Analysis: Re-Test of Support as Volatility Spikes Solana is currently trading at $145.24 after an aggressive drop from the $165\u2013$170 range. The 4-hour chart shows a clear breakdown below all key moving averages (50, 100, and 200), which had previously served as dynamic support. The red 200 SMA at $165.33 now acts as overhead resistance, capping short-term recovery attempts. The recent sell-off\u2014triggered by broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East\u2014pushed SOL straight into a key demand zone around $143\u2013$145, where buyers have historically stepped in. The long lower wick from today\u2019s candle reflects strong intraday buying at these levels, suggesting that some participants see this as a value zone. However, volume remains elevated, and the structure appears fragile. Any failure to hold $145 could open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $130 region. On the flip side, reclaiming the 100 SMA at $157.46 would be an early sign of renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Momentum indicators likely remain oversold, and if the broader market stabilizes, this level could mark a temporary bottom. Still, with volatility high and macro uncertainty looming, traders may want to stay cautious until a clear direction emerges. For now, $145 is the line in the sand.
