Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities According to market watchers, this bounce off long-term support could set the stage for a much bigger move, possibly as soon as July. Chart Pattern Points To Support Analysts have noted that Dogecoin\u2019s slide to $0.142 fits neatly into a rising pattern of higher lows. Based on analysis, the dip hit a multi-year trendline that first showed up in October 2023. At that time, prices fell to a similar zone before reversing. Once Dogecoin found footing, it moved into an ascending channel, forming a steady string of higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart. $DOGE $1 https://t.co/KgAc4sZ2LN \u2014 WIZZ\ud83e\udd77 ( beware scammers ) (@CryptoWizardd) June 24, 2025 July Could Be The Launchpad Meanwhile, crypto analyst WIZZ have predicted that Dogecoin\u2019s next leg up could begin in July. If the current support holds, they argue, DOGE may pick up speed and push toward the wedge\u2019s tip and hit $1. The analyst&#8217;s chart shows a potential rally to $1.40, which would mark a 740% jump from today\u2019s levels and blow past the $1 mark that many have eyed for years. Multiple Forecasts Add Fuel To The Debate This isn\u2019t the first time experts have set sights on $1 for Dogecoin. Galaxy Research put the $1 target on its radar before the end of 2025. Javon Marks, in his own analysis, sees DOGE breaching $1.25 by riding a bullish continuation pattern. Other analysts have called for a 500% surge after a falling-wedge breakout in March. $0.6533 for $DOGE with a high likeliness of a break above, bringing $1.25+ into play!

Long-Term Risks Dogecoin\u2019s recent turn higher adds about 10% to its weekly lows, and it\u2019s up roughly 5% over the last weekly session, trading near $0.166. But critics point out that DOGE lacks the fundamental backing of tokens that power major networks. Its price moves largely on community enthusiasm and hype. If Bitcoin or the broader crypto market cools off, Dogecoin could see sharper drops than more established assets.

A 500% move in one month would be historic\u2014even by meme-coin standards. But that kind of rally demands perfect market conditions and lots of buying momentum. If support breaks again, losses could come just as fast. Traders who choose to play this rebound may want to set clear profit targets and tight stops.

      "summary": "Dogecoin changed hands near $0.162 in late-European trading on June 26, little changed on the day but still more than 13% above last Sunday\u2019s swing low. Yet beneath that placid price action, the market is balancing on what YouTube analyst More Crypto Online calls \u201ca wait-and-see situation\u201d that could ignite either a decisive upside impulse or a slide back toward $0.14. Dogecoin Teeters On The Edge In a video published yesterday under the headline \u201cIs DOGE About to CRASH or SOAR? Price Analysis &#38; Scenarios,\u201d the Elliott-wave commentator argues that the advance from the June 22 bottom remains incomplete. &#8220;The Doge chart is currently still, yeah, trying to reverse here to the upside from the swing low that formed on the 22nd of June,\u201d he says at the outset, stressing that the rise so far is \u201conly a three-wave move.\u201d Because the structure has not yet printed the full five-wave sequence that typically inaugurates a new bullish trend, he cautions traders against assuming the worst is over. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal\u2014But One Move Could Ruin It The technician locates that June 22 low inside a demand band between $0.15 and $0.14, a zone that also includes the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the May\u2013June rally and sits just above April\u2019s cycle through\u2014his hard \u201cinvalidation point.\u201d From there, Dogecoin bounced in what he labels an a-b-c recovery, with the third wave peaking at $0.169, exactly the 1.618 Fibonacci extension he looks for in a \u201chealthy third wave.\u201d If price can now carve a fourth-wave higher low and extend to a fifth-wave high near $0.174\u2013$0.177, the analyst says, \u201cwe actually get five waves up and then we can add support \u2026 and we have a setup.\u201d Until that confirmation, the move remains a \u201cchameleon-like\u201d B-wave\u2014prone to deeper pullbacks than the more bullish wave-two alternative. The line in the sand is $0.158. \u201cAny break now below $0.158 cents would indicate the upside-reversal attempt is failed and we fall back into the support region, maybe we\u2019ll even test the $0.14 level,\u201d he warns. Conversely, holding that micro-support and punching through the $0.17 handle would provide the first \u201cevidence\u201d that a durable bottom has formed. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target The stakes are high because, as the analyst points out, confirmation of a five-wave impulse would force subsequent corrections to respect a higher-low framework, allowing traders to reposition with clearer risk parameters. Failure would likely drag Dogecoin back into the wide consolidation range that has dominated June and risk flipping sentiment toward a protracted downside grind. For now, the memecoin\u2019s near-term fate rests on whether buyers can engineer that final fifth-wave pop without first violating $0.158. \u201cAt the moment,\u201d he concludes, \u201cwe\u2019re in a wait-and-see situation to see if we actually get five waves up.\u201d Until the chart resolves, Dogecoin remains suspended between a technical breakout and another leg down\u2014boom or bust hinging on a single intraday signal.

      "title": "Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-above-300000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price could be entering the final and most explosive phase of its current market cycle, as an analyst maps out the cryptocurrency\u2019s next movements onto a parabolic step-like structure. Reinforcing this bullish outlook is the Elliott Wave 5 count, which points to an epic price rally that could propel Bitcoin above $300,000, eclipsing its previous all-time high and current market value by a substantial margin. Bitcoin Price Ultimate Parabolic Push Unveiled A newly released Bitcoin price forecast by X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Gert van Lagen boldly suggests that the leading cryptocurrency may be on the verge of its most aggressive bull run this cycle. Lagen\u2019s price chart indicates that BTC is firmly locked into a parabolic step-like growth structure, potentially eyeing an extended Wave 5 breakout that could drive prices well beyond $345,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The trajectory of the analyst\u2019s chart illustrates a clear parabolic growth curve anchored by four distinct formations, labeled Base 1 through Base 4. Each of these bases represents a phase of accumulation and consolidation that preceded a Bitcoin price breakout. This structure also mirrors a textbook parabolic setup, where each new base sets the stage for steeper upward moves. Most notably, after the completion of Base 3, marked by the inflection point on the chart, Bitcoin launched into a sharp rally, confirming the expected parabolic behavior. Lagen\u2019s analysis now indicates that BTC\u2019s current Base 4 has been completed, followed by a corrective A-B-C structure that appears to have reached its bottom, positioning the cryptocurrency for the anticipated final leg of its cycle. Using Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin\u2019s price action is still unfolding within the fifth wave, which is the final advance in the five-wave impulsive cycle. The price chart identifies Wave 1 as beginning shortly after the 2022 lows. This was followed by a powerful breakout in 2023, which defined Wave 3, while Wave 4 concluded more recently with a classic corrective pattern. Notably, the upcoming Wave 5 could see Bitcoin skyrocket anywhere between $300,000 and $425,000, depending on the timing and strength of its bullish momentum. Timeline For Game-Changing Rally A key element in Lagen\u2019s analysis is the dynamic \u201csell line\u201d drawn near the upper end of the parabolic arc that runs underneath the Bitcoin price movement on the chart. According to the analyst, the longer it takes for Bitcoin to hit this projected vertical trajectory, the higher the price at which the potential market top might occur. This is due to the upward curvature of the parabolic trend line itself, which steepens over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Currently, Lagen forecasts an early breakout by July 7, 2025, if momentum resumes immediately. However, if Bitcoin continues consolidating through the summer, the projected peak could rise further, as the sell line would continue climbing over time.

      "title": "XRP Silent Accumulation: A Falling Wedge On The Verge Of Explosion",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-falling-wedge-explosion/",
      "summary": "After months of muted price action, XRP appears to be quietly building pressure within a textbook falling wedge formation. With over seven months of consolidation and recent price activity pressing up against the wedge\u2019s resistance, subtle bullish signs are beginning to emerge. As momentum coils tighter, this silent accumulation phase could be setting the stage for a significant breakout. XRP Chart Indicators Echo Uncertainty In a recent X post, GemXBT highlighted that XRP is currently exhibiting a sideways market structure. The price has been hovering around the $2.19 mark, showing signs of consolidation rather than a clear trend. This range-bound movement suggests that neither bulls nor bears are in control at the moment. Related Reading: Expert Charts 1,400% Course To $7.5 For XRP Price As RSI Falls To All-Time Low GemXBT further pointed out that the short-term moving averages \u2014 specifically the 5MA, 10MA, and 20MA- are beginning to converge. This alignment typically signals market indecision, and when combined with a neutral RSI reading near 50, it reinforces the lack of directional bias. Such conditions often precede a significant price move, though the direction remains uncertain. Adding to the neutral outlook, GemXBT noted that the MACD is flat, reflecting a lack of momentum in either direction. Volume is also relatively low, suggesting reduced trader participation and a possible wait-and-see approach by the market. This quiet environment could persist until a breakout or breakdown confirms the next move for XRP. A Bullish Break May Be Brewing According to XRPunkie in a post on X, XRP has been stuck in a falling wedge structure on the weekly chart for the past seven months. This prolonged consolidation phase reflects a period of tight price movement, with XRP gradually coiling within narrowing boundaries. Such a pattern often signals a potential breakout in the making, especially when observed over an extended timeframe. Related Reading: Ripple Plans To Take 14% Of SWIFT Volume, USDC Lands On XRPL \u2013 What Does This Mean For XRP Price? XRPunkie further highlighted that the past seven weeks of price action have occurred just beneath the wedge\u2019s resistance line. This consistent pressure near resistance indicates growing strength on the buyers\u2019 side. Additionally, XRP has formed a hidden bullish divergence, a signal that often hints at a continuation of the prevailing trend, in this case, pointing toward a possible upward move. The analyst emphasized that repeated testing of a resistance zone tends to weaken it over time. With XRP continuously knocking on the upper boundary of the wedge, XRPunkie believes a breakout may be imminent. He concluded with a clear stance: \u201cOverall Bullish Soon,\u201d suggesting that market conditions could soon favor the bulls if current momentum holds. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.17 with a $128.61 billion market capitalization and $2.59 billion in 24-hour trading volume, reflecting ongoing consolidation in the market.

      "summary": "According to Bitwise\u2019s Jeff Park, Bitcoin has gone from a risky experiment to a six-figure asset over three New York mayoral terms. Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities It started near $754 when Michael Bloomberg left office in December 2013. Now, as the city prepares for its next election, it\u2019s trading above $107,000. These numbers show a rise of about 14,590% in just over a decade. Mayoral Timeline Marks Bitcoin Growth Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014. At first, Bitcoin barely budged. But by December 2021, it hit roughly $47,000. That climb happened while de Blasio\u2019s two terms played out on City Hall\u2019s stage. The crypto market had its ups and downs, yet the overall trend pointed skyward under his watch. Worth noting that in the time it took New York to go from Bloomberg to Mamdani, Bitcoin soared from $754 to $106,000+ today. You may not see nor believe it right away, but this is actually not a coincidence. Separate money from state. \u2014 Jeff Park (@dgt10011) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin\u2019s Surge Through Political Change When Eric Adams stepped in as mayor in January 2022, he made headlines by taking his first paychecks in Bitcoin. The move sent a clear message that New York was open to crypto. The market then endured a tough 2022 bear phase. Still, Bitcoin bounced back strong in 2023 and kept going. This month, it\u2019s up about 3% and sits at $107,567, according to figures by Coingecko. Separate Money From State Park used the mayor count as a storytelling tool. He\u2019s calling for a break between money and government. His view: people should choose how they handle their own cash. Political shifts come and go, but Bitcoin keeps growing on its own terms. That steady rise speaks to the idea of financial freedom outside state control. New Leadership And Future Trends Zohran Mamdani has surged ahead in the Democratic primary after Adams declared an Independent bid. Since Democrats usually win in New York, many see Mamdani as the likely next mayor. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin\u2019s $107K Push Park even joked that Bitcoin\u2019s journey has moved \u201cfrom Bloomberg to Mamdani.\u201d That line underlines how the asset climbed, even as the city\u2019s politics reshuffled itself. It\u2019s easy to draw lines between mayoral posters and price charts. But Bitcoin\u2019s real drivers go beyond City Hall. Global demand, big investors, shifts in mining, and moves by the Federal Reserve have all shaped its path. New York\u2019s mayors provide handy markers on the timeline, not the engine of growth. On Crypto &#38; Politics As New York eyes November 2025, Bitcoin stands as proof that financial tools can live beyond politics. The question now isn\u2019t whether the next mayor will back crypto. It\u2019s how far Bitcoin will go when its story isn\u2019t tied to any single office. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
