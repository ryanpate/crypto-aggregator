      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-breakout-imminent-broadening-wedge-hints-at-4200-surge/",
      "summary": "According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum (ETH) may be gearing up for a major breakout that could propel the cryptocurrency close to the $4,200 mark. Meanwhile, ETH continues to attract growing institutional interest, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) outperforming their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts. Ethereum Headed For A Breakout? In a recent X post, noted crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH is climbing within a massive weekly broadening wedge structure. The analyst shared the following chart and suggested that ETH could be targeting the $4,200 level &#8211; marking the top of the wedge. For the uninitiated, a broadening wedge is a chart pattern characterized by diverging trendlines, where price makes higher highs and lower lows, forming a megaphone-like shape. It typically indicates increasing market volatility and can signal a potential breakout, with the direction depending on the prevailing trend and breakout confirmation. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates \u2013 Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto echoed a similar outlook, stating that ETH is \u201csetting up for a big move,\u201d especially with over $2.2 billion in short positions clustered near the $3,000 level. If Ethereum breaks above $3,000, it could trigger a short squeeze, potentially accelerating ETH\u2019s rally. At the time of writing, ETH is trading 43.7% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Capital flows also indicate rising institutional interest in Ethereum. Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows recently pointed out that spot ETH ETFs attracted $240.3 million in inflows yesterday, compared to $164.6 million for spot BTC ETFs. The stronger performance of ETH ETFs suggests that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. It\u2019s worth noting that while BTC is up 54% since June 2024, ETH is still down 24.6% during the same period. Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader shared the following monthly BTC/ETH chart showing two consecutive red candles, signaling a potential shift in momentum as BTC weakens relative to ETH. The trader noted that a similar capital rotation in 2020 preceded a \u201cmonster altseason.\u201d Things Look Positive For ETH While altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and SUI created fresh ATHs in 2024, ETH\u2019s performance did not live up to expectations. As a result, the broader sentiment in the Etheruem ecosystem took a hit. Related Reading: Ethereum \u2018Insanely Undervalued\u2019 As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking \u2013 Is A Rally Imminent? However, 2025 appears to be ushering in a more favorable outlook. On-chain data reveals that ETH faces no major resistance until the $3,417 level. Additionally, ETH recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart &#8211; a bullish technical signal that could indicate an impending rally. At press time, ETH trades at $2,756, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from with Unsplash, charts from X and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-funding-rate-flips-again-and-history-says-a-rally-is-around-the-corner/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has declined slightly following recent gains, falling 2.3% over the past 24 hours to trade at approximately $107,205. This latest movement places the asset 4.1% below its all-time high of over $111,000 recorded last month. Despite the short-term dip, some analysts see familiar signs in derivatives data that could point to the next phase of market movement. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin\u2019s Calm Rally Could Be a Setup for a Massive Breakout, Analyst Reveals Funding Rate Rebounds Signal Potential Upside for Bitcoin According to recent insights shared by on-chain analyst &#8220;nino&#8221; on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin may be repeating a funding rate pattern that has historically led to price rebounds. The data shows the asset\u2019s funding rate briefly dipping into negative territory before beginning to reverse, a pattern that has aligned with price recoveries earlier in the year. Nino\u2019s analysis suggests this reversal, particularly the 72-hour moving averages exiting the oversold zone and producing a yellow-blue-black signal formation, could indicate a potential round of short position liquidations. The funding rate, still below levels typically associated with excessive bullish sentiment, may also imply that traders have yet to become overconfident, leaving room for additional upside without immediate overheating in derivatives markets. Nino\u2019s observation focuses on market structure and derivative sentiment, highlighting how positioning in perpetual futures markets could precede notable spot price moves. In particular, when funding rates turn negative and then begin to climb, they often reflect the unwinding of overly bearish bets by traders who shorted BTC at high leverage. As these traders are forced to close positions, the resulting buy pressure can act as a short-term catalyst. This setup has played out multiple times earlier in 2025, and the current conditions suggest it may be occurring again. By keeping track of moving averages and sentiment zones, traders may interpret these signals as part of a broader cyclical trend. Binance Volume Share Signals Key Trends in Market Liquidity Separately, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Burak Kesmeci, addressed structural shifts in spot trading liquidity, particularly Binance\u2019s share of global trading volume. Kesmeci emphasized that Binance\u2019s dominance remains an important barometer of institutional participation and overall market health. He explained that an increase in Binance\u2019s spot volume share is often associated with higher liquidity and smoother price discovery. Conversely, if Binance were to fall below a 30% volume threshold, it could signal a move toward more &#8220;fragmented liquidity&#8221; across exchanges such as Coinbase or Upbit. Such shifts could lead to more volatility and less predictable trading behavior.

      "summary": "The Tron (TRX) Sharpe Ratio suggests the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price may be far from overheating, a sign that the coin could have more upside potential. Tron Sharpe Ratio Is Still Significantly Below Overheating Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Sharpe Ratio of Tron. The &#8220;Sharpe Ratio&#8221; refers to an indicator that compares the returns of an asset against the risk associated with it. The numerator in the ratio, the &#8216;returns&#8217; portion, is defined as the difference between the average return of the coin and the risk-free return (that is, the theoretical return involved with an asset carrying zero risk) over a given period. The denominator, the &#8216;risk&#8217; part, is the asset&#8217;s standard deviation of returns over the same window (in other words, its volatility). Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet\u2014But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the cryptocurrency is printing returns that outweigh its risk. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the asset&#8217;s performance has been lackluster compared to its volatility. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Tron Sharpe Ratio over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron Sharpe Ratio fell below the 1 level earlier, but its value has since returned above the mark. According to the quant, the metric being above the level has historically accompanied bullish price action. An extremely high value, however, has proven to be an overheating signal, with the asset tending to arrive at a top. &#8220;Whenever the Adjusted Sharpe Ratio climbs above 40, it often signals a market that&#8217;s overheating,&#8221; explains the analyst. &#8220;In the past, readings over 40 have lined up well with local tops.&#8221; So far since its return above 1, the Tron Sharpe Ratio has only managed to reach a high of 8.3, which is clearly significantly below this cutoff. This trend could mean that TRX hasn&#8217;t been too overheated. &#8220;With TRX\u2019s Sharpe Ratio still far from historical peaks, the data suggests there&#8217;s plenty of upside room for a potential bull run in 2025,&#8221; says the quant. It now remains to be seen how the coin will develop in the near future, given this pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400? On-Chain Shows No Big Hurdles Ahead In some other news, the Tron network set a new record in USDT transaction volume last month, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. In total, the month of May saw over $694 billion in USDT transaction volume on the Tron network. Around $411 billion of these transfers were of a size that&#8217;s generally associated with the whales. TRX Price At the time of writing, Tron is trading around $0.272, down 1% in the last week.

Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $106,500 and $105,500 levels. The price is trading below $106,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $106,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh recovery wave if it clears the $105,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Sharply Bitcoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $110,500 resistance zone. BTC declined below the $107,500 and $106,500 support levels. The price even dipped below the $104,200 support level. Finally, it tested the $103,000 zone. A low was formed at $103,078 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib level of the recent decline from the $110,273 swing high to the $103,078 low. Bitcoin is now trading below $105,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $106,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $104,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $105,500 level. The next key resistance could be $106,600 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $110,273 swing high to the $103,078 low. A close above the $106,600 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $108,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $110,000 level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $105,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $103,000 level. The first major support is near the $102,350 level. The next support is now near the $101,500 zone.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/uni/uni-flashes-upside-strength/",
      "summary": "In a recent update shared by Crypto Man MAB on X, UNI\u2019s price action has taken a bullish turn. The token is currently trading at $8.403, up 1.82% (+$0.150), and has managed to break past the previous resistance range of $ 7.50\u2013$ 8.00. This upward movement signals growing buying interest, and that momentum could be building for a stronger push ahead. Key Support And Resistance Levels Define UNI\u2019s Next Move In his analysis, Crypto Man MAB highlighted UNI&#8217;s evolving price structure, pointing to key support and resistance levels. The immediate support is seen around $7.103, which marks the 24-hour low. If UNI pulls back further, stronger support may be found near $6.500, a level that has previously attracted buying interest and could act as a safety net for bulls. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Blastoff At Hand? The Sleeping Giant Awakens At $4.6 Support On the upside, resistance stands near $8.677, the recent 24-hour high. This zone is currently capping the rally, but if buying momentum persists, UNI could target the $9.0 mark next. While this level presents a psychological barrier, it also aligns with short-term bullish projections, adding more weight to its significance. In terms of market activity, Crypto Man MAB noted a notable increase in trading volume, which aligns with UNI\u2019s recent price surge. This volume spike suggests that buyers are stepping in with strong conviction, reinforcing the strength behind the upward movement. A sustained high volume typically validates price action, which supports the argument for a potential rally continuation, provided the momentum holds and no major resistance halts the trend. Breakout Signals Strength, But Long-Term Caution Lingers According to the analyst, the UNI chart shows a shift from a period of consolidation into a noticeable upward breakout. The recent dominance of green candlesticks points to growing bullish moves and renewed buying pressure in the short term. Related Reading: Uniswap Stays On Course For More Gains \u2013 $12.3 Resistance In Sight However, the longer-term trend suggests a more cautious outlook. Over the last 180 days, UNI has declined by 53.31%, and its one-year performance shows a decrease of 18.98%, indicating that the asset has been in an overall downtrend despite recent gains. Presently, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) is demonstrating increased trading activity, which aligns with the positive price movement and supports the current bullish sentiment. This rise in volume may strengthen the case for a possible continuation of the ongoing upward trend, but traders should remain alert to any shifts in momentum. In conclusion, Crypto Man MAB noted that UNI is showing short-term upward strength, but the broader trend remains uncertain. However, a clear breakout above the $8.677 resistance level would be a strong signal for continued upside. Featured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com"
