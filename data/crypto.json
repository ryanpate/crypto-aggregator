      "summary": "The \u2018MicroStrategy\u2019 of Ethereum has emerged, with Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee and Joe Lubin making moves to advance their respective ETH treasuries. Tom Lee has emerged as the Chairman of BitMine, which will hold ETH, while Lubin is already the Chairman of SharpLink Gaming. Lee and Lubin Raise $675 Million for Ethereum Treasury Strategy Tom Lee and Joe Lubin have already advanced their plans to create the \u2018MicroStrategy\u2019 of Ethereum. On Tom Lee\u2019s end, BitMine announced a $250 million private placement to raise capital for its Ethereum strategy. The Bitcoin mining company stated that the net proceeds of the offering will be used to acquire ETH, which will become the firm\u2019s primary reserve asset. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here\u2019s Why BitMine plans to close this private placement on or about July 3, as it aims to become one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders with Tom Lee as the Chairman of the Board. On the other hand, SharpLink Gaming, with Joe Lubin\u2019s help, is already the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder. The company earlier launched its Ethereum treasury with a $425 million ETH purchase. SharpLink Gaming recently announced that it has increased its total ETH holdings to 198,167 ($475 million), further establishing its position as the \u2018MicroStrategy\u2019 of Ethereum. Between June 23 and 30, it acquired 9,468 ETH for $22.8 million at an average price of $2,411 per ETH. During that same period, SharpLink Gaming also raised an additional $24.4 million through its At-The-Market (ATM) facility, selling $2.5 million shares. The company revealed that most of the proceeds will go toward further Ethereum acquisitions. As of June 30th, 100% of its ETH is staked, and the firm has earned 222 ETH in rewards since it began an ETH treasury company. Plans To Mirror Saylor\u2019s Strategy In an X post, crypto commentator Eric Conner commented on how Ethereum is getting its own MicroStrategy era thanks to Lee and Lubin\u2019s experiments. He highlighted BitMine\u2019s proposed KPI of \u2018ETH per share,\u2019 which mirrors Saylor\u2019s playbook, except that ETH earns yield in this instance through staking. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor\u2019s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Conner further remarked that BitMine\u2019s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum. On the other hand, he noted that Joe Lubin and SharpLink Gaming\u2019s move is bigger. SharpLink is already staking its ETH holdings and plans to explore other DeFi strategies. With this move, the crypto commentator declared that ETH becomes the reserve while yielding bankroll growth. Lubin also recently raised the possibility of adding leverage to SharpLink Gaming\u2019s Ethereum strategy, which will mirror Saylor\u2019s strategy. He stated that they may do convertible equity and issue bonds at low rates, without putting the strategy at risk. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,444, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-under-0-20-is-free-predicts-2000-upside/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin is revisiting a technical juncture it has not seen since the months preceding its 2020\u201321 parabolic rally, according to a comparative chart published by the pseudonymous analyst Kaleo to his 705,000 followers on X. In the annotated TradingView graphic, weekly candles for DOGE-USD trace two multi-year falling wedge structures\u2014one stretching from the January 2018 high to early 2021, and an almost mirror-image pattern extending from the May 2021 peak until today. History Repeating For Dogecoin? The first wedge resolved in late 2020 with a decisive breakout above a descending trend-line that had capped every rally for more than thirty-six months. Kaleo marks that moment with a yellow label reading \u201cWe are here\u201d at roughly $0.003, immediately before the price detonated to the cycle top near $0.75 in May 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit The current structure shows the same downward-sloping resistance\u2014now anchored by successive lower highs from $0.16 in late 2022 to $0.11 in late 2023\u2014finally giving way. Since the, DOGE has recorded higher highs in April at $0.22 and in December 2024 at $0.48. Friday\u2019s close printed at $0.1604, still below the psychological $0.20 threshold but fractionally above the dotted secondary resistance that has defined the wedge\u2019s upper boundary since mid-2022. Kaleo\u2019s overlay projects the 2020 breakout trajectory forward in time, mapping a near-vertical thrust from the present $0.16 area to roughly $0.55, a brief consolidation, and a continuation leg that tops close to $3.50. While this upper target hasn\u2019t ever been printed in DOGE\u2019s history, the analyst\u2019s replica path underscores how little overhead structure exists once price escapes the wedge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal\u2014But One Move Could Ruin It A key role in the chart are playing the two vertical dashed lines labeled \u201cBTC Halving\u201d: 12 May 2020 and 21 April 2024. In Kaleo\u2019s read, Dogecoin\u2019s macro reversals are synchronized with Bitcoin\u2019s quadrennial supply shock, implying that the breakout could be a post-halving echo of the 2020 move. Price construction within the wedge also mirrors the earlier cycle: successive lower highs and higher lows compress volatility until an impulsive weekly bar pierces resistance. The horizontal line intersecting the new breakout\u2014will be the first major test of post-wedge momentum. Below, the lower dashed boundary intersects in the region between $0.10 and $0.09; a weekly close beneath that floor would invalidate the fractal. Kaleo distills the setup into a single line: \u201cDogecoin under 20 cents is free.\u201d On the chart\u2019s scale, the red quote-box at $0.1604 sits a hair\u2019s breadth under the $0.20 psychological band, reinforcing the idea that the risk-to-reward profile remains asymmetric so long as price stays below that number. Whether history rhymes as precisely as the analyst\u2019s fractal suggests will hinge on broader market liquidity and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, but from a purely structural perspective the meme-coin has already checked the same boxes it did four years ago. And the US Federal Reserve money printer hasn\u2019t even started roaring again. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.161. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/public-firms-snag-131000-btc-surpassing-etfs-in-bitcoin-purchases/",
      "summary": "According to CNBC, corporate treasuries around the globe have surpassed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions for three consecutive quarters. This indicates a growing interest among public companies to adopt strategies similar to those pioneered by Strategy, especially in a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Bitcoin Holdings Surge Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that public companies acquired approximately 131,000 Bitcoin in the second quarter of the year, marking an 18% increase in their BTC holdings. In contrast, exchange-traded funds managed to secure about 111,000 Bitcoin, representing an 8% growth during the same period. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup \u2013 Here\u2019s Why BTC Holds The Key Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, emphasized that the motivations behind these purchases differ significantly. While institutional buyers utilizing ETFs seek exposure to BTC for a variety of reasons, Marie asserted that public companies are primarily focused on accumulating Bitcoin to enhance shareholder value. The market dynamics have also shown that public company BTC holdings increased by 4% in April, a month marked by significant volatility following President Trump\u2019s announcement of initial tariffs. During the same time frame, ETF holdings rose by only 2%. Marie noted that public companies are less concerned with Bitcoin&#8217;s current market price, prioritizing the growth of their Bitcoin reserves to appear more attractive to potential investors. ETFs Still Dominate In This Key Metric Despite the increasing activity from public companies, Bitcoin ETFs remain the largest holders of the cryptocurrency, collectively holding over 1.4 million BTC, or about 6.8% of the total capped supply of 21 million coins. Public companies, on the other hand, hold around 855,000 Bitcoin, approximately 4% of the total supply. The recent surge in corporate BTC accumulation is also a reflection of significant regulatory changes favoring the crypto industry. The last time ETFs outperformed public companies in Bitcoin purchases was during the third quarter of 2024, prior to Trump&#8217;s re-election. Several notable companies have entered the Bitcoin market recently. GameStop began acquiring Bitcoin after its board approved it as a treasury reserve asset earlier this year. Similarly, health-care firm KindlyMD merged with Nakamoto, a Bitcoin investment company, while investor Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s ProCap launched its own BTC purchasing initiative and plans to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Direct Exposure May Ease Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, continues to lead the charge in the Bitcoin treasury space with approximately 597,000 Bitcoin in its possession. Following closely is Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings, which holds nearly 50,000 coins. Ben Werkman, chief investment officer at Swan BTC, remarked on the challenges smaller firms face in trying to match Strategy&#8217;s scale. He predicted that institutional capital will continue to gravitate toward Strategy due to its deep liquidity and established presence. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury Looking ahead, Marie suggested that the number of companies adhering to a BTC treasury strategy may dwindle over the next decade as the market matures. He noted that as more firms enter the space, the individual impact of each company will likely diminish. Additionally, as Bitcoin becomes more normalized, investor constraints regarding direct exposure may fade. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/long-term-bitcoin-holders-near-pain-point-last-seen-in-october-2024/",
      "summary": "According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, long\u2011term Bitcoin holders are sitting on unrealized gains last seen during the October 2024 market dip. Right now, those holders show an average profit of 220% on coins they bought and held for the long run. That figure is surprisingly low given Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge back above $107,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming Lower Profit Levels Than Previous Peaks Darkfost used the MVRV ratio \u2014 market value relative to the average cost paid by long\u2011term holders \u2014 to track these shifts. In March 2024, when Bitcoin pushed up to $74,500, MVRV hit 300%. Then in December 2024, at the $108,000 peak, it climbed to 350%. By contrast, today\u2019s 220% gain reflects the fact that many long\u2011term holders bought in at much higher levels than earlier in the cycle. Price Needs To Rise To Match Past Gains Based on an average cost basis of $33,800, Bitcoin would need to climb back to $135,200 just to restore that 300% profit level. If the market aimed to hit the 357% mark again, prices would have to reach roughly $154,400. Both figures track with what history tells us about investor behavior \u2014 people tend to sell when profits hit big round numbers. \ud83d\udcc9 Unrealized profits of LTH continue to decline and are now approaching levels last seen during the October 2024 correction. The average unrealized profit, based on the MVRV ratio, currently stands at around 220%. That may seem high for BTC, but when compared to previous\u2026 pic.twitter.com/NeTCmXZVTY \u2014 Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) July 1, 2025 &#160; Historical Cycle Comparisons Looking farther back shows how much room remains. In December 2017, at the $19,500 top, long\u2011term holders saw unrealized profits of 4,000%. Then during the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin spiked to $63,000 in April 2021 and MVRV topped out at 1,230%. By November 2021, prices hit about $68,400 but unrealized gains for long\u2011term holders had already fallen to 340%. An analyst&#8217;s recent outlook lines up with this math, first pegging a cycle top at $135,000 in October 2024. After reviewing new data in May 2025, they revised the target range to $120,000\u2013$150,000 and suggested a likely peak between August and September 2025. That range overlaps with the price levels needed to bring MVRV back to earlier highs. Room For More Upside, But Watch The Risks Based on latest figures, Bitcoin is trading at $106,750, roughly flat over the last 24 hours. Lower profit margins mean fewer long\u2011term holders are itching to sell right now, which could leave more fuel for higher prices. Still, on\u2011chain numbers don\u2019t capture the whole picture. Spot-market flows, ETF moves and wider economic shifts can all trigger sharp reversals. Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful?

If Bitcoin follows past cycles, it may have farther to climb before long\u2011term holders lock in gains at levels seen in March or December 2024. But investors should balance these on\u2011chain metrics with real\u2011world signals \u2014 and be ready for whatever comes next. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is on track to report an impressive $14 billion in unrealized gains from its extensive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Co-founded by Michael Saylor, the company has successfully transformed itself from a struggling enterprise software provider into a leading leveraged Bitcoin proxy, drawing comparisons to major corporate powerhouses such as Amazon and JPMorgan Chase. Strategy Set To Post Record Profits According to a recent Bloomberg report, Strategy&#8217;s anticipated profits stem largely from the rebound in Bitcoin prices and recent changes in accounting practices that allow the firm to value its substantial cryptocurrency holdings at market rates. Analysts project that while Strategy&#8217;s software business may only generate approximately $112.8 million in revenue for the second quarter, the surge in Bitcoin prices has significantly bolstered its financial outlook. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury This potential record profit comes after a turbulent period for the company, which faced criticism from notable investors like Jim Chanos. Chanos has publicly derided Saylor&#8217;s valuation model, describing it as &#8220;financial gibberish,&#8221; while Saylor has countered that Chanos fails to grasp the intricacies of his approach. Despite the skepticism, Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Capital, noted Saylor&#8217;s resilience, stating that he has consistently outperformed not only his critics but also the broader market. Since Saylor initiated his Bitcoin buying spree, Strategy\u2019s stock has skyrocketed over 3,300%. In the same time frame, Bitcoin has appreciated approximately 1,000%, while the S&#38;P 500 has advanced around 115%. The company&#8217;s shares saw a 40% increase in the second quarter, significantly outpacing the S&#38;P&#8217;s 11% rise. $64 Billion Bitcoin Value The recent accounting change at Strategy, which took effect in the first quarter, allows the firm to recognize the market value of its Bitcoin holdings\u2014currently valued at about $64 billion\u2014resulting in substantial swings in reported earnings. Previously, the company treated its Bitcoin similar to intangible assets, which limited their ability to recognize gains unless the assets were sold. This change has positioned Strategy to capture the full benefit of Bitcoin&#8217;s price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase At the start of the second quarter, Strategy held 528,185 BTC, valued at over $43.5 billion based on market prices. An increase in the value of Bitcoin of 30% during the quarter alone contributed more than $13 billion to the company&#8217;s unrealized gains. Cumulatively, weekly purchases have brought the company closer to holding 600,000 BTC. Despite the positive outlook, the company has faced legal challenges, including several class-action lawsuits claiming that executives misled shareholders regarding the first-quarter losses. In response, Strategy has pledged to vigorously defend against these accusations. As of press time, BTC trades at $106,100, down 5% from its current record high of $111,800 during May\u2019s rally.
