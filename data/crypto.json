      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/50-bitcoin-price-crash-60000/",
      "summary": "Despite the Bitcoin price holding up quite nicely above $100,000 and remaining very close to its all-time high levels, there continues to be expectations of a massive crash that would rock the market. Pseudonymous crypto analyst FriendlyRox points to a number of indicators for this, going from volume to momentum, all pointing to a possible price crash. What is the expected result of this? Losing the $100,000 psychological level and then falling to previous peaks. Bitcoin Price At Risk With Dwindling Volume And Momentum In the analysis, FriendlyRox highlighted the decline in major metrics such as momentum and volume as the major driver of the forecasted price crash. This comes amid bullish news dominating the headlines, such as institutions increasing their Bitcoin holdings and supply on exchanges falling toward new lows, meaning investors are choosing to hold for higher prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Explosive Breakout: $5,791 The Minimum Target\u2013Analyst The decline in the volume has been apparent after the Bitcoin price had fallen below $100,000 before bouncing back up in June. So far, in the month of July, the Bitcoin trading volumes have trended lower, with data from Coinglass showing consistent daily volumes below $100 billion. At the same time, there has also been a decline in momentum, with the analyst pointing out a negative divergence in this metric. Furthermore, the Bitcoin price has also flashed a historical trend that has usually predated market tops. This is price reaching the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and then retracing. FriendlyRox revealed that in the past, whenever the price touched the 50 EMA and then extended back, it usually signalled a crash, and the Bitcoin price has done this now, extending even further. Other metrics that have also flashed bearishness include the RSI and the MACD, both of which are now showing a loss of momentum as they moved into the negative. All of these factors happening together at the same time have painted a pretty bleak picture for the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. BTC Bottom Targets With the lineup of bearish developments, the crypto analyst has predicted an approximately 50% from here. As volume continues to decrease and momentum slides into the negative, they expect that the Bitcoin price will be looking to retrace back to the 50 EMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The interesting fact here is that the 50 EMA falls below the previous Bitcoin price peak, putting it at $60,000. A crash of this magnitude would only be rivaled by the COVID crash in 2020 and the FTX-induced market crash back in 2022. But nevertheless, it would mean a wipeout for altcoins across the board. As for the timeframe for when this could happen, there is no definite timeline. Going by the analyst\u2019s chart, it could take a couple of years for this to completely play out, with the analyst closing with: \u201cLet us see how it unfolds.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm co-founded by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has made headlines once again on Monday, but not for its usual Bitcoin acquisitions, but for its notable absence of purchases during the week of June 30 to July 6. This marks the first time since late March that the largest corporate holder of BTC has not added to its impressive treasury, which currently stands at 597,325 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $64.71 billion. Strategy Bitcoin Investment Hits A Pause The lack of activity in Bitcoin acquisitions is surprising, especially given Strategy&#8217;s aggressive purchases over the past few months. These purchases have brought the company close to holding nearly 3% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s total supply. From April 7 through June 29, the company invested $6.77 billion in acquiring 69,140 BTC, averaging about $97,906 per coin. At current market prices, these investments have appreciated by 10.4%, now worth around $7.49 billion.

As of this writing, MSTR closed the day at $395. This highlights the close relationship between the company\u2019s performance and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the company&#8217;s stock has enjoyed a rise of 38.5% in 2025, outpacing BTC\u2019s 16.1% increase and the S&#38;P 500&#8217;s modest gain of 6.1%. Up To $4.2 Billion For Future BTC Investments In addition to this pause in BTC purchases, Strategy did not issue any new common or preferred shares during the specified week. However, the company announced a sales agreement to potentially issue and sell up to $4.2 billion in 10% preferred stock. According to Monday\u2019s press release on the matter by the Bitcoin proxy firm, the proceeds from this sales agreement are earmarked for general corporate purposes, which include future BTC acquisitions and working capital needs.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-resistance-walls-analyst-flags-3-key/",
      "summary": "An analyst has pointed out three key resistance levels for Dogecoin that could be to keep an eye on, based on on-chain data. Dogecoin URPD Shows These Price Levels Stand Out In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared DOGE levels that could be important resistance boundaries. The levels in question correspond to major supply walls on the Dogecoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD is an on-chain indicator from the analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the total amount of the memecoin&#8217;s supply that was last purchased at the different price levels that it has visited over history. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned Now, here is the chart posted by Martinez that shows how the URPD looks for Dogecoin right now: As displayed in the above graph, the level closest to the latest Dogecoin spot price that stands out in terms of the URPD is $0.18. The investors last purchased around 8.94% of the asset&#8217;s supply around this mark. Naturally, as the level is above the spot price, all of these holders would be in the red at the moment. Generally, investors in loss look forward to retests of their break-even mark so that they can get their money &#8216;back.&#8217; Often, these holders push for the exit as soon as this happens, fearing that the price would go back down again in the near future. As such, whenever the price retests the cost basis of a notable part of the supply from below, a significant selling reaction can sometimes appear in the market. This can provide resistance to the cryptocurrency. Considering that the $0.18 level is particularly large, it can act as a point of notable resistance. Similarly, the analyst has also flagged two other levels: $0.21 (7.24% of supply) and $0.36 (3.82% of supply). Interestingly, between these two, there aren&#8217;t any significant supply walls, meaning that if Dogecoin can get into this zone, it may, at least in theory, have an easier time climbing up. In the scenario that DOGE gets rejected at the resistance, however, it may have to find support at the in-profit supply zones. Holders belonging to these levels can react to declines to their cost basis by buying more, as they may believe the drawdown to be just a dip-buying opportunity. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins\u201462% Held By Just 10 Whales The only level below the current Dogecoin spot price that stands out in terms of supply is all the way down at $0.07. It hosts the acquisition mark of 20.03% of the memecoin&#8217;s supply, which means that it&#8217;s massive in size, and so, could be a strong support center. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, up 1.6% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "BNB price is gaining pace above the $650 support zone. The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $620 support zone. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $662 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $655 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Gains After forming a base above the $620 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $645 and $650 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price even surged above the $660 level. A high was formed at $666 before there was a downside correction. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $662 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $662 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $665 level. A clear move above the $665 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $672. A close above the $672 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $662 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $655 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high. The next major support is near the $650 level. The main support sits at $644. If there is a downside break below the $644 support, the price could drop toward the $632 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $620 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels \u2013 $655 and $650. Major Resistance Levels \u2013 $662 and $665."
