      "summary": "Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) above $118,000, but on-chain data from Glassnode shows BTC volume remains low despite the breakout. Bitcoin Volume Still At Historically Low Levels Just recently, Glassnode had revealed that volume related to Bitcoin had dropped to yearly lows, potentially hinting at the start of a summer lull. Now, following the breakout to new highs, the on-chain analytics firm has shared updated data in a reply to an X user, showcasing how volume has changed since. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that both the Spot and Futures Volumes, corresponding to Bitcoin trading activity occurring on the spot and futures platforms, respectively, plummeted at the end of June and remained low into early July. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle\u2014Next Stop $164? With the latest price breakout, however, both metrics have seen an increase, suggesting activity has noted an uplift across both the spot and futures markets. That said, while there has indeed been an uptick in trading, volumes still remain low when compared to history. Historically, rallies have usually only been sustainable when they have been able to capture mass attention from the traders. This is because the fresh activity is what ends up providing fuel for these runs to keep going. &#8220;The takeaway here is that BTC hit an ATH despite thin liquidity &#8211; worth paying attention to,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. It now remains to be seen whether the activity increase would continue in the coming days or if the lull is here to stay. In some other news, a key Bitcoin indicator still remains outside the euphoria zone, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. The metric in question is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) of the long-term holders. The NUPL measures, as its name suggests, the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the BTC investors are currently holding. Here, the NUPL of the long-term holders (LTHs) specifically is of interest, who are the investors holding their coins for more than 155 days. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin LTH NUPL over the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH NUPL has observed a rise alongside the latest price rally as LTH profits have grown. However, despite this, the indicator stands at 0.69, which is under the 0.75 level that has historically separated euphoric markets.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-targets-liquidity-above-3000-price-magnet-forming/",
      "summary": "Ethereum just broke above the critical $3,000 level, marking a major technical milestone after surging over 20% since Tuesday. This decisive breakout signals renewed strength in the second-largest cryptocurrency, with bulls reclaiming control after weeks of tight consolidation. The move is reigniting interest across the broader altcoin market, which had remained relatively muted during Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally to all-time highs. Now, with ETH leading the charge, many altcoins are showing signs of reversal and upward momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level \u2013 Relief Or Reversal? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, a key factor behind Ethereum\u2019s rally is the large concentration of liquidity resting just above the $3,000 mark. Once Ethereum cleared the $2,850 resistance, momentum rapidly accelerated, driving price through the $3,000 level and into a new range of opportunity. This rally comes amid a broader shift in market sentiment. As Bitcoin sets record highs, Ethereum and other altcoins appear poised to catch up. The big question now: can ETH maintain this level and lead a full altcoin season, or is this just a temporary breakout before another round of consolidation? Ethereum Breaks Out Of Consolidation Range Ethereum has spent the last several weeks consolidating within a clearly defined range that began in early May. The altcoin hovered between support around $2,800 and resistance just below $3,000, with multiple failed attempts to break above. That changed yesterday. ETH finally closed above this key resistance, signaling a potential breakout and confirming the start of a new bullish phase. This move comes as broader macroeconomic conditions improve. Strong labor market data in the US, alongside signs of de-escalation in several global conflicts, have helped reduce uncertainty and reignite risk appetite across financial markets. With Bitcoin reaching new highs and risk-on sentiment returning, Ethereum\u2019s breakout may signal the next wave of upside for altcoins. Top analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a key technical factor: \u201cETH liquidity is lying above $3,000 \u2014 and liquidity is a magnet.\u201d This means that large clusters of buy and stop orders are concentrated above this level, attracting price movement toward those zones. Now that Ethereum has broken past resistance, the presence of high liquidity could accelerate its move upward as traders chase momentum. The breakout also holds symbolic weight. It shows that investors are regaining confidence in Ethereum\u2019s value proposition, particularly with the broader altcoin market showing signs of life. If ETH can hold this breakout and establish $3,000 as new support, the next leg higher could materialize quickly, opening the door to targets in the $3,400\u2013$3,600 range. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason ETH Breaks Major Resistance Ethereum (ETH) has decisively broken above the psychological and technical resistance at $3,000, closing its most recent candle at $3,008.97. This breakout follows a strong 15% daily surge, as seen in the chart, marking a powerful move backed by growing bullish momentum. Volume has expanded significantly, confirming trader conviction and institutional participation in this move. The breakout puts an end to nearly two months of sideways action, with ETH previously locked between the $2,500\u2013$2,850 range. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $2,796, was breached with strength, acting as a springboard for price acceleration. The reclaim of this moving average adds technical validation to the breakout and signals the beginning of a new bullish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves ETH is now in a key zone for potential continuation. As long as bulls defend the $2,850\u2013$2,900 level as support, Ethereum has room to rally toward $3,400 and beyond. With Bitcoin trading at all-time highs and macro conditions turning favorable for risk assets, ETH could lead the next wave of altcoin expansion. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "The XRP price could be preparing for a historic breakout, as a prominent crypto pundit has pinpointed two key catalysts that could send the altcoin soaring to new all-time highs. As analyst sentiment flips bullish, and XRP attempts to move out from its prolonged consolidation phase, the stage may be set for the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-awaited price explosion. Factors Set To Send XRP Price To A New ATH JD, a well-known crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has identified two critical technical conditions that could propel the XRP price to a fresh ATH target. According to the expert, XRP\u2019s path to a historic price surge depends on breaking out of a long-standing Falling Wedge pattern and invalidating the EDO Farina indicator. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% \u201cMoonshot\u201d For XRP Price If This Line Breaks The Falling Wedge pattern has held XRP in a tight consolidation phase for an extended period, particularly evident on the weekly chart. JD considers this formation historically bullish when broken to the upside, and XRP is apparently nearing a pivotal point where a breakout could be imminent. Notably, a successful breach of this Falling Wedge pattern would signal renewed bullish momentum and potentially spark a rally toward uncharted price territory. The second factor emphasized by the crypto analyst is the need to render the EDO Farina bearish indicator null and void. JD views this technical signal as a false indicator of sustained downward movement. The market expert maintains a strong and long-standing bullish position on XRP, predicting on multiple occasions that the cryptocurrency could soon skyrocket. In one of his latest price analyses, JD outlined his bullish forecast for XRP, citing his previously accurate call of a 12x rally to $3.37. Confident in his method, the analyst now aims to apply the same strategy to pinpoint the altcoin\u2019s next market top. JD also noted that no major news, hype, or sudden excitement is necessary to drive XRP to a new all-time high. In his view, such events often trap inexperienced traders, causing them to buy high and get \u201cRekt.\u201d Building on this optimistic outlook, the analyst projects that the altcoin will eventually climb to new levels before crashing by up to 90%. Analyst Forecasts Over 250% Surge For XRP In a bold new analysis, Javon Marks, another prominent crypto analyst, shared a bullish outlook for XRP, predicting a potential price surge of over 251% from its current level. According to the market expert, historical price behavior and long-term chart patterns indicate that XRP may be on the cusp of entering its next significant upward leg, with targets set at $9.631. Related Reading: XRP Price About To Explode: XRPBTC Could Repeat 2017 Fractal Notably, XRP\u2019s bullish target is not confined to this level.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/analyst-sounds-the-alarm-shiba-inu-primed-for-over-1500-breakout/",
      "summary": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) might be on the verge of a powerful rally, according to crypto analyst MasterAnanda, who believes the popular meme coin could climb more than 1,500% in this cycle. The analyst predicts SHIB may cancel another zero and reach a new all-time high if a few key levels are cleared. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape Signs Of A Possible Reversal SHIB has been stuck in a downtrend since March 2024. It peaked at $0.000045 before sliding back to close that month at $0.000030. Since then, the coin has moved within a descending triangle pattern, bouncing around the base while facing strong bearish pressure. However, something may be changing. SHIB has just printed a fully green weekly candle and gained 15% over the past seven days. According to analysts, this is one of the most bullish weekly moves since early May, when the token jumped 25%. Despite the optimism, SHIB remains below its 200-day moving average, which sits at $0.000016. That&#8217;s around 19% higher than its current price of $0.000013. Analysts see this as a critical level the token must beat to confirm a long-term bullish trend. Bullish Price Targets Appear On The Chart MasterAnanda believes SHIB will break above the triangle and make a run toward $0.000032, aligning with the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level. If that plays out, the analyst sees a further move to $0.000067, then to $0.00010, which would represent a new all-time high. From there, two more possible targets have emerged using Fibonacci extensions: $0.00017 and $0.00022. Those would mark gains of 1,180% and 1,529%, respectively. While ambitious, other analysts have also supported a similar price path based on the same descending triangle breakout. Shiba Inu Sentiment Mixed As Greed Index Climbs Although bullish targets are grabbing headlines, market sentiment is still uncertain. Based on recent data, SHIB recorded green days on just 13 out of the last 30, and showed 4.25% price volatility. The current reading for sentiment is &#8220;Neutral&#8221; and the Fear &#38; Greed Index stands at 69, which is in the &#8220;Greed&#8221; category. Price prediction tools indicate that SHIB could increase 27% to August 10, 2025, at about $0.000017. That will bring it nearer to its MA-200, but still far from the lofty targets being predicted by some analysts. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason SHIB holders are now waiting to see what&#8217;s next. Will the triangle breakout occur in a hurry, or will resistance levels hold the token below major technicals? The coming weeks may provide the answers.
