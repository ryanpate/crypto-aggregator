      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-open-interest-climbs/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin open interest has risen rapidly once again, with the price pushing above previous peaks to new all-time highs. The BTC price has also stayed over the $100,000 mark for an extended period of time, triggering a new wave of confidence that the cryptocurrency has found its bottom. This has led to crypto traders making their bets and driving the open interest up, pushing it back above December 2024 levels and May 2025 peaks. Bitcoin Open Interest Crosses $70 Billion Again Back in December 2024, the Bitcoin open interest had recorded a new milestone after the volume rose to over $70 billion, marking a new all-time high at the time. The Bitcoin price had also risen sharply at this time and was able to hit $100,000 for the first time in history, triggering even more interest in the asset. Related Reading: Last Crash Before The Surge: Why Bitcoin Is Set To Drop Below $107,000 However, once both the price and the open interest hit these milestones, it wasn\u2019t long before the shorters began to take over the market. The Bitcoin price quickly plummeted back down below $100,000, and over the next few months, open interest would crash back down to the $40 billion territory, resulting in a 40% loss by May 2025. Now, once again, the Bitcoin open interest has crossed the $70 billion mark, sitting close to the $77 billion peak recorded back in May 2025, data from Coinglass shows. In the same vein, the BTC price has been able to maintain above $100,000 and has hit a new all-time high of $117,000. Going by historical performance, it is likely that the Bitcoin price will continue to rise from here, but this break to new all-time highs could carry bearish implications. This is because it is possible that the trend from December 2024 could play out once again. If this happens, then the Bitcoin price could retrace after hitting new highs, an expected correction as shorts pile up. BTC Price Risks Another Crash As the Bitcoin open interest continues to rise and the price has already broken out to new highs, the expectations of a downtrend have become stronger. reported that crypto analyst FriendlyRox expects the Bitcoin price to crash by almost 50%, putting the target as low as $60,000 by the time it\u2019s done. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP\u2019s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated Crypto analyst and market expert Capo of Crypto has also joined the train, predicting a notable crash event that will send Bitcoin below $100,000 and obliterating altcoins in the process. This comes as institutions are piling into the crypto market, with Bitcoin in the lead, and Capo forecasts a possible \u2018Black Swan\u2019 event like the COVID crash.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-breaks-symmetrical-triangle-next-stop-164/",
      "summary": "Solana has shown a potential breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle. Here&#8217;s where the next price target could lie, according to an analyst. Solana Has Surged Above Symmetrical Triangle Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Solana has just broken a resistance line. The level in question is part of a Symmetrical Triangle, a pattern from technical analysis (TA). This pattern belongs to the class of triangles, formations that involve the asset trading within two converging trendlines. The upper line acts as a source of resistance, while the lower one as that of support. A break out of either of these levels implies a continuation of trend in that direction. A surge above the triangle is a bullish sign and a drop under it a bearish one. Since the price&#8217;s range becomes narrower as it travels within a triangle, a breakout can become more likely as it approaches the apex. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype\u2014$4.4B Inflows Back The Move Generally, triangle breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the height of the formation (that is, the distance between the upper and lower trendlines at their widest). There are three popular triangle types: Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical. The first and second variants have one trendline parallel to the time-axis. In the case of the Ascending type, it&#8217;s the upper level. This means that as Solana moves inside an Ascending Triangle, its range gets narrower toward a net upside. Similarly, the Descending Triangle involves the opposite setup, with the support line being parallel to the time-axis instead. The third type, the Symmetrical Triangle, is the middle ground between the two: it has the two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In other words, the Symmetrical Triangle represents a period of consolidation where the range gets narrower in true sideways fashion. Due to this fact, a breakout is more-or-less equally probable to occur in either direction. In contrast, there is a bias associated in Ascending and Descending Triangles. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle Solana was trading inside just earlier: As is visible in the above graph, the Solana price was nearing in on the end of the triangle and as probability would dictate, a breakout was becoming likely. The asset indeed ended up finding a break and it seems to have been in the up direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading So what could be next for SOL? According to the analyst, the asset might target $164. This level corresponds to the 1.272 Fibonacci Extension line. Fibonacci Extension levels are defined based on ratios found in the popular Fibonacci series. The 1.272 level, in particular, corresponds to the square root of 1.618, which is the famous &#8216;Golden Ratio.&#8217; SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $158, up 3% in the last 24 hours.
