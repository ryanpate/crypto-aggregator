      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-yearly-trend-suggests-cycle-top-near-205000-by-year-end-analyst-says/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a moderate price correction since June 11, falling from around $111,000 to just above $104,000 at the time of writing. While rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East may be weighing on the asset, several analysts maintain that BTC\u2019s long-term bullish trajectory remains intact. Bitcoin To Top At $205,000? In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor Carmelo Aleman pointed to the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend as a signal of strong potential growth in BTC\u2019s price through the rest of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance \u2013 A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend tracks BTC\u2019s annual price performance since 2011, revealing a recurring pattern of three bullish years followed by one year of consolidation. This trend aligns closely with Bitcoin\u2019s four-year halving cycle, helping investors identify long-term market phases beyond short-term volatility. Aleman shared the following chart to support his outlook for 2025. If BTC maintains the growth pace typically seen in the third year of this cycle, it could climb 120% in 2025. Such a surge would take BTC from $93,226 at the beginning of the year to as high as $205,097 &#8211; potentially marking the cycle top for this year. If realized, this would make 2025 the third consecutive year of gains and complete another full bullish cycle. This scenario suggests that BTC is currently in the final phase of its ongoing cycle, giving investors limited time to adjust their strategies to align with the market\u2019s growth trajectory. Supporting this outlook, other cyclical metrics &#8211; such as Realized Cap &#8211; continue to post new all-time highs in 2025. Aleman concluded: The Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend is a tool that allows us to filter out daily market noise and reconnect with Bitcoin&#8217;s true cyclical nature. It reminds us that beyond micro metrics and short-term candles, Bitcoin adheres to a structural rhythm that repeats with striking consistency: three years of expansion followed by one of compression. On-Chain Indicators Suggest More Upside Beyond the Yearly Percentage Trend, several on-chain metrics continue to support a bullish case for BTC. Notably, both whale and retail BTC inflows to Binance have dropped to cycle-lows &#8211; often a sign that investors are holding in anticipation of further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 Whales also appear to be accumulating ahead of a potential breakout. According to CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, Bitcoin whales withdrew 4,500 BTC from Binance on June 16 &#8211; a move historically associated with price rallies. Still, caution remains warranted. On-chain data indicates that short-term holders have been selling into the recent dip, which could temporarily suppress price momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,079, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. Featured image with Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-danger-a-dip-under-0-16-could-trigger-a-30-crash-analyst/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s price is back at a crucial line. It\u2019s testing the $0.168 area for a second time since mid\u2011April. A clear break could send the meme coin spinning lower. Bulls and bears are watching every tick. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Key Support Under Scrutiny According to crypto expert Ali Charts, Dogecoin fell roughly 30% from its mid\u2011May high. That slide brought it down to the same $0.168 mark that held as support last April. If prices drop below that level on a weekly close, there are hardly any bids to slow the fall. Below $0.168 lies what traders call a \u201cgap area,\u201d where past buying activity was sparse. That could open the door to steeper losses and fast moves. Cup And Handle Pattern Based on reports, the current chart forms part of a four\u2011year cup\u2011and\u2011handle setup. The lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle sits right where the handle meets its cup. A clean break above the triangle\u2019s upper trendline would point to a target near $0.75. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 That projection comes from the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the cup\u2019s depth. Hitting $0.75 would mean a 350% gain from today\u2019s levels. Momentum Indicators Signal Weakness Momentum readings have lost much of their shine. After a brief golden cross in May, the 50\u2011day moving average slipped under the 200\u2011day in early June. The MACD line is widening beneath its signal, hinting at longer\u2011term selling pressure. The RSI sits at 42, under the neutral 50 mark, and drifting lower. Under 50 on the RSI often points to more sellers than buyers. With those readings turning sour, bulls need a strong bounce around $0.168 to stay alive. ETF Decision Could Swing Sentiment All eyes now turn to June 15, when US regulators may rule on a spot Dogecoin ETF. Approval would let traditional money flow in from big funds. A thumbs\u2011down or a delay, on the other hand, could spark fresh sell\u2011offs. That decision could make or break the next leg of Dogecoin\u2019s move. Related Reading: Trump Media Makes Moves On Bitcoin And Smartphone \u2013 What\u2019s Next? According to CoinCodex data, Dogecoin has recorded 13 out of 30 green days over the past month, with price swings of about 10.57% on average. Their forecast pegs DOGE at $ 0.20 by July 18, a 17% rise from current levels. Market sentiment sits in the neutral zone, and on\u2011chain signals aren\u2019t flashing clear buy or sell warnings. This week\u2019s action around $0.168 will tell us if Dogecoin can steady itself. Holders and traders should watch volume, weekly closes, and that looming ETF call. If support holds, we may see a rebound. If it breaks, lower levels could come into view fast. Either way, Dogecoin is at a make\u2011or\u2011break moment\u2014and everyone will be listening for the next big clue. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
