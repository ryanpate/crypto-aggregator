      "summary": "Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) above $112,000, and if on-chain data is to go by, there is some real conviction behind the move. Bitcoin Realized Cap Shows ATH Breakout Not Just Speculative In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the &#8220;Realized Cap&#8221; of Bitcoin. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates the asset&#8217;s total value by assuming that the &#8216;true&#8217; value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading This is different from the methodology that the usual market cap employs, where all tokens part of the supply are assigned the same value: the current Bitcoin spot price. The last transaction of any token is likely to represent the last time that it changed hands on the network, so the price at that time could be considered as its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all coins, its value essentially represents a net cost basis for the entire supply. In other words, the model can be looked at as a measure of the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying in the present. During the past day, the Bitcoin market cap saw a surge as the spot price set a new record. But what about the Realized Cap? &#8220;Unlike market cap, Realized Cap reflects actual capital inflows &#8211; only rising when coins move at higher prices,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode, showing whether or not real capital inflows occurred for Bitcoin with this rally: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap has been following an upward trajectory for a while now, suggesting capital inflows have been coming into the asset. With the latest price surge, too, the metric has seen a leg up, corresponding to a whopping $4.4 billion flowing into the coin. &#8220;The $4.4B jump as $BTC broke a new ATH above $112K confirms real conviction behind the move, not just speculative markup,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. In some other news, the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is currently sitting around the 2.25 mark, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has pointed out in an X post. The MVRV Ratio measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and Realized Cap. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that BTC encountered resistance the last few times the metric hit a value around 2.75.

Right now, the 2.75 level corresponds to a spot price of $130,900. &#8220;This will essentially be the first selling pressure point,&#8221; says the analyst.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-signal-last-time-preceded-464-rally/",
      "summary": "In a new video released June 9, crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK issued a extremely bullish XRP update, citing a convergence of technical signals that he believes could set the stage for a powerful upward move. Drawing parallels to previous market cycles, the analyst points to the reappearance of a signal that once preceded a 464% rally in XRP, and says this may mark the beginning of a similar explosive breakout. XRP Breakout Confirmed? Yesterday, XRP recorded its highest 4-hour close since May 23, breaking out of a prolonged range. The token has entered what he called a \u201cdense area of liquidity,\u201d an important technical zone that has historically preceded impulsive price action. In a notable divergence from typical market dynamics, XRP is leading Bitcoin, rather than following it. \u201cXRP is currently leading Bitcoin on this move,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve been calling for a while is for XRP to lead alts and lead a potential alt season.\u201d CryptoInsightUK sees further confirmation in Bitcoin\u2019s setup. BTC is still consolidating but pushing above the $111,000 liquidity zone. A move into that zone, he said, would \u201cgive us confluence that the price action XRP\u2019s displaying is not a fakeout.\u201d Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP\u2019s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated Structurally, XRP\u2019s trend remains intact. Despite recent pullbacks, the token has maintained its higher-low formation, a signal of technical strength. More importantly, XRP/BTC is beginning to show momentum reversal. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had the highest 4-hour close since the 24th of May. This is showing the momentum to the downside is waning.\u201d He highlights a specific line on the XRP/BTC chart referenced by fellow analyst Credible Crypto as the \u201cGandalf line\u201d\u2014a level that has acted as a pivot point for years. XRP has now closed above it on the 4-hour chart. &#8220;We\u2019ve wicked into it, bounced off it. We lose it, we get pushed down hard. We break it, we normally really go for it.&#8221; Zooming out, he points to the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) on XRP\u2019s price chart. If the current weekly candle closes above the RSI\u2019s simple moving average, it would be the first time since XRP\u2019s breakout off the lows\u2014an event that previously triggered a 464% move to $2.70. \u201cIf we get the bullish cross close\u2026 464% from this [level] would take us to $13.05,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to about $12 on this push.\u201d Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% \u201cMoonshot\u201d For XRP Price If This Line Breaks Moreover, the analyst anticipates a 325% move in XRP/BTC based on historical ratios and a potential surge in XRP dominance toward 14%, with an even more aggressive Elliott Wave count pointing to a possible move to 20% dominance. \u201cWe\u2019ve completed a Wyckoff accumulation. We\u2019re in the sign of strength phase. Last point support\u2026 we\u2019re going into phase E,\u201d he said, referencing classical technical accumulation structures. Still, despite the bullish setup, the analyst made clear he plans to de-risk between $8 and $13, emphasizing capital preservation after a potential 20x move from 50 cents. \u201cThe risk-to-reward on the downside is just too large at that point,\u201d he noted. \u201cEven if it goes significantly higher\u2026 anyone who\u2019s done a 20x on something should be taking some money off the table.\u201d He concluded the analysis with cautious optimism: \u201cDon\u2019t start counting your Lambos yet, but also probably start scrolling the magazine.\u201d For now, all eyes are on XRP\u2019s price action and Bitcoin\u2019s staying power above $111,000. If both confirm, as he put it: \u201cIt\u2019s game on.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.44. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

The analyst suggested that the altcoin can\u2019t reach such heights and revealed what price levels he will be taking profits at. Analyst Indicates XRP Price Cannot Reach $1,000 In an X post, Jaydee stated that while the \u201cmoonboys and influencers: are waiting for the XRP price to reach $1,000, he plans to take more profits at his next levels.

He further suggested that the rally will be similar to how XRP recorded an explosive surge in 2017, when it rallied from $0.0006 to $3.80. However, Jaydee doesn\u2019t expect this to happen. Instead, his accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could just rally to a conservative target of around $7 between August and September. This would still mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin. The crypto analyst also recently predicted a 50% \u201cmoonshot\u201d for the XRP price, which could send it to as high as $3.35 in the short term. A rally to $3.35 will bring the altcoin close to its current ATH of $3.80. It would also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. XRP Is Bullish On All Timeframes In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender declared that the XRP price is bullish on all timeframes for the first time since January 2025, when it reached its yearly high of $3.3. In another X post, the analyst stated that XRP is way ahead, having recorded a breakout above $2.33. With this breakout, he remarked that the altcoin\u2019s journey to its all-time high has begun. Related Reading: XRP Price Closes Highest Quarterly Candle In History Dark Defender\u2019s accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could surpass its current ATH of $3.80 and rally to $4.2.

Crypto analyst CasiTrades also highlighted how bullish the break above $2.30 was for XRP. She claimed that the altcoin could reach as high as $3.04 on this leg up. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.42, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/hidden-clue-in-bitcoin-close/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s latest hourly close may be offering more than meets the eye. With the 25- and 50-hour SMAs holding firm and the MACD showing renewed expansion, some analysts believe a breakout could be quietly brewing, and smart traders are starting to take notice. BTC\u2019s Momentum Builds With Healthy Technical Backing In his latest 1-hour market update, Shaco AI noted that Bitcoin continues to humor the bulls, printing a strong close at $111,225.5. The price action has maintained a clear bullish bias, staying well above both the 25-hour simple moving average (SMA) at $110,147 and the 50-hour SMA at $109,420. This positioning suggests that BTC is building a solid base for continuation, with short-term trend followers likely remaining confident in the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading Furthermore, the MACD has widened impressively, with a gain of $589.72, reflecting persistent buying pressure and bullish sentiment. As the MACD histogram expands and signal lines diverge, it reinforces the idea that the bulls may be far from done, and dips could be viewed as buying opportunities. Shaco AI also pointed to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now sits at 63.73. This level shows that the market is in a healthy bullish zone, strong enough to maintain upward momentum, but not yet in overbought territory that typically invites profit-taking or cooling off. Adding confidence to the trend, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has hit 38.93, which Shaco AI emphasized as a key confirmation that the current trend has strength and durability. With all key indicators pointing to continued bullish structure, supported by rising momentum, trend alignment, and strong directional force, Bitcoin\u2019s short-term technical picture remains decisively positive. The bulls are in control, and the chart suggests they may not be done pushing just yet. Breakout Or Breakdown? Bitcoin Poised At A Technical Crossroads Shaco AI, in his final remarks, highlighted that Bitcoin is approaching critical territory, marking resistance at $111,999.79 and support at $108,096.55 as the key zones to watch. He urged traders to &#8220;watch these like a hawk!&#8221; as price action around these levels could be decisive in determining BTC\u2019s next major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Upward Move \u2014 Can It Break New Highs? He also pointed out that trading volume has been unusually quiet, joking that it &#8220;seems to have missed some coffee breaks,&#8221; with just 395 units recorded compared to the average of 869. This lighter volume signals reduced conviction, which could lead to sudden volatility or fakeouts near those key zones. \u201cKeep those eyes peeled for potential breakouts or retracements as BTC flirts with key levels, but do remember there&#8217;s caution in the air with this lighter trading volume,\u201d the expert added.

      "summary": "Solana is exhibiting strong bullish signs supported by moving averages, volume, and momentum indicators, which hint at a short-term pause or consolidation in the rally. What Bulls Need To Watch To Sustain The Rally In an X post, Gemxbt stated that the Solana 1-hour chart has displayed a bullish market structure, with the price trading above the 5, 10, and 20-day moving averages. The indication of short-term moving averages signals strong upward momentum, which shows that buyers are in control. The recent price action has been supported by notable volume spikes, confirming the strength behind the upward moves and adding credibility to the rally. Related Reading: Solana Whale Moves $152 Million In One Splash\u2014What\u2019s Going On? The key resistance is around $154, where SOL has previously faced selling pressure. This zone will determine whether bullish momentum can push the price higher. On the downside, support is sitting near $150, which is acting as a cushion to absorb any immediate selling pressure and prevent a deeper pullback. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, which may signal that the asset is due for a period of consolidation or sideways movement before continuing its climb. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recently shown a bullish crossover, reinforcing the uptrend and suggesting the upward momentum could continue if buying interest persists. Crypto investor and trader Theodor Coin also revealed that the Solana 1-hour chart is showing a clear recovery after the dip seen in early July. The open interest is trending upward and has now surpassed $3.62 billion. An increase here typically indicates growing trader market engagement, which is a precursor to heightened volatility and significant price moves. From here, a breakout above the $154 resistance could unleash a powerful rally fueled by the increasing market interest and positive momentum. Uptrend Line Remains Intact \u2014 A Positive Sign A crypto analyst known as Day on X also updated that Solana is holding above the long-term support area around $120 on the weekly chart, a level that has been a launchpad for rallies. Related Reading: Solana Ready For $160 Reclaim? Analysts Say Breakout Is A Matter Of Time The long-term uptrend line remains intact, and with each higher low, the case for a massive cup-and-handle pattern becomes stronger. However, this pattern won&#8217;t confirm until SOL breaks above the critical $250 resistance zone, a level that capped price action during the previous rally. If SOL manages to break out above the $250 zone, it could unlock a measured move price target of $500, which marks a milestone in Solana&#8217;s recovery and expansion. The analyst also noted that SOL is not there yet, and that the first step for bulls is reclaiming $185 resistance level, which has consistently rejected upside attempts. featured image from iStock images, chart from tradingview.com"
