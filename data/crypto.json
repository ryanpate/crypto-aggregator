      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-freezes-og-whales-dump-on-wall-street/",
      "summary": "While Bitcoin continues to hover above the $100,000 threshold, the driving forces behind this historic consolidation phase appear to be more complex than the surface-level narratives of institutional \u201cFOMO\u201d and ETF euphoria. According to multiple leading analysts, a silent rotation is underway\u2014one that suggests long-term holders are offloading their positions while corporate treasuries and institutional buyers quietly absorb the flood. OG Bitcoin Whales Are &#8216;Dumping&#8217; On Wall Street Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, delivered a sobering breakdown via X on June 29, challenging the prevailing belief that Bitcoin\u2019s price stagnation amid surging demand is anomalous. \u201cPeople are wondering why BTC has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDespite what X news might suggest, it&#8217;s because Bitcoin OGs (long-term holders) have been dumping on Wall St since the ETF Launch in January 2024, unloading their positions.\u201d Edwards, known for blending on-chain metrics with macro frameworks, pointed to a visible dynamic shift that is now being captured in blockchain data. While older coins are being redistributed, a newer class of holders\u2014primarily treasury-oriented entities\u2014are stepping in aggressively. \u201cWe have clearly entered the heat of [the Treasury Company] trend today as many copy-cats have entered the market,\u201d he said, referencing his earlier prediction on Bits and Bips that corporate adoption would eventually eclipse ETF inflows in relevance. What makes this transition particularly remarkable is the data behind it. Edwards highlighted that 6-month-plus BTC holders\u2014commonly associated with more strategic, non-speculative accumulation\u2014have skyrocketed in the past two months. \u201cThe amount of BTC acquired in the last 2 months by this cohort has completely consumed all of the BTC unloaded by LTHs over the last 1.5 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIncredible.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin In Stalemate With Liquidation Traps On Both Sides Of The Market This cohort&#8217;s aggressive accumulation, he added, has historically preceded bullish squeezes. \u201cWhenever aggressive spikes in 6M+ holders occur, price usually squeezes following these periods. Short-term bullish,\u201d Edwards remarked. However, he tempered the optimism by cautioning that broader on-chain data still signals fragility. \u201cIf the 6M+ holders (Treasury Companies) can continue their relentless buying, that should be achievable,\u201d he noted, signaling that the flywheel has momentum, but is not yet immune to systemic pressure. Adding another layer to this developing narrative, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Co-founder and CSO at Ledn, offered an alternative theory. He suggested that what appears as two flows\u2014LTHs selling and Treasury entities buying\u2014might in fact be \u201cthe same trade.\u201d He wrote, \u201cLong term holders [are] selling spot to buy ETFs/BTC Treasury Cos. Even though that feels unnatural for us bitcoiners.\u201d Di Bartolomeo framed the shift as generational, pointing out that many early adopters may simply be more comfortable in traditional financial custody rather than self-sovereign wallets. Related Reading: Analyst Spots Bitcoin Time Bomb Hidden In Bullish Weekly Chart But Edwards pushed back on that explanation, arguing that if ETF migration was driving the reclassification of long-term holders, it would be evident across multiple aging cohorts. \u201cI don&#8217;t think so because we would have seen a similar uptrend over time in the 6M+ and 1Yr+ cohorts if that was the case,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome is definitely moving to equities, but it&#8217;s very typical of this stage of the Halving cycle to see LTH selling into profit.\u201d Why Bitcoin ETF Do Not Have A 1:1 Effect On Price The apparent dissonance between rising demand and stagnant price has also prompted commentary from on-chain analyst TXMC, who warned that most observers misunderstand what actually sets Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cBitcoin people grossly underestimate how little of the supply is actually setting the price every hour,\u201d he wrote. He described Bitcoin\u2019s fragmented market structure as a web of siloed exchanges, loosely synchronized through cross-exchange market-making. \u201cEach location has its own liquidity and depth which vary wildly. A large market order can have an outsized effect depending on which exchange it is placed at, and which time of day.\u201d TXMC argued that while ETFs and institutional desks are accumulating large quantities of Bitcoin, much of this activity is routed through OTC desks that bypass order books entirely. \u201cThese actions do not affect the price in the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe desks source their own liquidity, and only have to go into the books to fill the difference.\u201d This explanation may help reconcile why ETF inflows in the billions of dollars have failed to push BTC significantly higher. Edwards\u2019 thesis aligns with this too, insofar as the ETF boom may be fueling redistribution rather than outright net demand. TXMC added: \u201cStop underestimating how many big entities are out there looking for exit liquidity.\u201d Despite growing bullishness in cohort composition, the real test lies ahead. Whether corporate treasuries and ETF managers can absorb the remaining exit waves of Bitcoin\u2019s earliest holders remains to be seen. But if Edwards is right, the rotation may already be past its critical phase. \u201cThe flywheel still has a long way to go,\u201d Edwards concluded. And if history is any guide, these moments of consolidation amid redistribution tend to precede volatility\u2014not follow it. At press time, BTC traded at $108,044.

      "summary": "As the market\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), struggles to maintain momentum above the crucial $2,500 threshold, one analyst believes that ETH is poised for a significant rally. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. &#8220;Most doubt ETH and altcoins right now\u2014I&#8217;m betting on $4,000 this summer,&#8221; he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop&#8217;s analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"
