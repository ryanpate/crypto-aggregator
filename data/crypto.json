      "summary": "Bitcoin and Ethereum both posted modest gains in the past week, with BTC rising 6.2% and ETH up by 9.6%. However, momentum appears to have paused at the start of the new week. As of Monday, Bitcoin trades just above $107,000 after a slight 0.6% daily dip, while Ethereum has remained flat over the past 24 hours. Analysts have turned to blockchain data and macro signals for cues on where the market may head next. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freezes Over $100,000 As OG Whales \u2018Dump On Wall Street\u2019: Expert Bitcoin and Ethereum Onchain Trend Recent insights from CryptoQuant Quicktake platform contributor Amr Taha provide some context behind the price action. In a detailed post, Taha noted that Ethereum inflows to Binance have continued for five consecutive days, a trend that could suggest either rising sell pressure or repositioning by major players. At the same time, data from Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holder (STH) Net Position Realized Cap shows a notable reversal, increasing from negative $49 billion to over $5 billion. This pattern is typically associated with increased activity from retail investors, especially during periods of upward price movement. Taha noted: Historically, spikes in (STH) occur near potential market tops, as retail investors tend to FOMO into Bitcoin rallies. While this doesn&#8217;t necessarily signal a reversal, it has often preceded short-term corrections or periods of sideways consolidation. Bitcoin\u2019s steady climb in June, despite occasional pullbacks, appears to have encouraged smaller investors to re-enter the market. In the case of Ethereum, another CryptoQuant analyst, \u201ccrypto sunmoon,\u201d pointed to continued accumulation by long-term holders during last month\u2019s price consolidation. This suggests a different dynamic is at play on the Ethereum side, with more patient capital building positions amid ongoing price suppression. Long-term holder accumulation often indicates growing confidence in an asset\u2019s future, even if current market conditions appear lackluster. US Policy and Macro Risk Add Layers to Market Outlook Beyond market behavior, external factors may also shape crypto price action. Amr Taha highlighted recent political developments in the United States, particularly former President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a proposed Senate bill promising wide-reaching tax cuts. The bill, which excludes taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security income, could lead to an increase in consumer liquidity. If passed, this could impact investor appetite across both traditional and digital markets by temporarily boosting household spending power. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Are Taking Fresh Market Positions, But Are They Safe? However, not everybody is convinced of the bill\u2019s long-term implications. Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that the measure, if not accompanied by spending cuts, could expand the federal deficit and lead to economic instability over time. Large fiscal imbalances often have ripple effects on monetary policy, potentially affecting interest rates, inflation expectations, and risk sentiment, all of which can influence investor behavior in crypto markets. Taha concluded: Geopolitical disturbances can significantly impact investor sentiment. In response, investors might reconsider their positions in asset markets, possibly moving away from riskier assets and equities toward more stable options like bonds or safe-haven currencies.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-july-preview-history-dont-trust-the-quiet/",
      "summary": "Market tactician Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) has put a statistical spotlight on Bitcoin\u2019s habit of dozing through June before rewarding \u2013 and sometimes punishing \u2013 traders in the following quarter. \u201cBTC June has historically been a pretty slow month,\u201d he wrote, noting that the just-ended period was no exception, with spot prices meandering in a narrow band and finishing \u201cpretty flat.\u201d The comment was accompanied by a Coinglass heat-map of monthly returns that reaches back to 2013 and vividly illustrates the summer pattern he is talking about. What July Hides For Bitcoin The numbers support the observation. According to the Coinglass dataset, the mean return for June over the past twelve years is essentially zero (-0.12 %), while July posts a respectable +7.56% on average and an even stronger +8.90 % on the median. August cools to a modest +1.75% mean, and September is where the sell-side pressure historically bites, averaging -3.77% with a negative median of -4.35%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freezes Over $100,000 As OG Whales \u2018Dump On Wall Street\u2019: Expert A simple frequency count underscores the asymmetry: July has finished green in eight of the last twelve years, whereas August and September managed only four positive outcomes each. Years that veterans still recall \u2013 2017\u2019s +65.32 % August melt-up followed by a -7.44 % September slide, or 2020\u2019s +24.03 % July rally that surrendered to a -7.51 % September pullback \u2013 appear to have etched the \u201cbig flush-out\u201d narrative into collective memory. Daan\u2019s takeaway is behavioural rather than predictive: \u201cAugust &#38; September are where we often see a big flush-out but are also the dips you often want to be buying into the end-of-the-year rally\u2026 it\u2019s good to be aware of these seasonalities. That way you can focus more on the larger timeframe and won\u2019t get spooked or get over-excited too easily.\u201d The comment arrives just as Bitcoin tests a cluster of long-timeframe resistances. In a post on Saturday he reminded followers that BTC is \u201cclose to all-time high but at resistance\u2026 [it] is yet to close a weekly or more than two consecutive daily candles above that resistance. Once it does, we can start getting excited for a larger move.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Are Taking Fresh Market Positions, But Are They Safe? The seasonality conversation matters because it collides with a crowded macro calendar and a notoriously illiquid holiday stretch. While historical averages do not guarantee future performance, the heat-map suggests that directional conviction often returns in October \u2013 the best-performing month on the table with a +21.89 % mean. For traders, that leaves a two-month corridor in which whipsaw moves are common and positioning discipline becomes paramount. Daan extends the framework to altcoins via the TOTAL3 index (crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ether). \u201cThe TOTAL Altcoin Market Cap has held on to its local support but is still not showing any clear trend\u2026 to really get this high timeframe move going you want to break those local highs above the ~$950 B mark. At that point you can start aiming for cycle highs.\u201d Whether 2025 repeats the seasonality script will hinge on the macro environment, ETF inflows and, above all, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to convert resistance into fresh price discovery. Until that weekly close arrives, seasoned traders appear content to keep summer expectations firmly tethered to the data \u2013 exactly as Daan recommends. At press time, BTC traded at $107,344.
