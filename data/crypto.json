      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin dominance remaining on the high side has been one of the major hindrances for the altcoin season. Going by past performances, the Bitcoin dominance would have to crash for altcoins to have a chance to rally, but with the dominance still climbing, the chances of an altcoin season remain slim. As this trend continues, a crypto analyst has predicted a possible turn in the tide for the Bitcoin dominance, predicting a crash that could give altcoins a chance. Bitcoin Dominance Rejection From Trendline Is Key Over the years, the Bitcoin dominance has been following a trendline that has often marked the point of resistance. This trendline rises from 2017 and has sloped down past 2021 and now into the year 2025. The significance behind this is the breakdown from the trendline and the Bitcoin dominance receding sharply from here. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs Presently, the Bitcoin dominance is still sitting high above 65% at the time of this writing, but this recent rise has seen it touch the resistance trendline. According to crypto analyst CoreCrypto, this is a critical inflection point, especially on the weekly chart. More importantly, this is usually the point where dominance recedes, giving rise to altcoin dominance. Some major developments that the analyst tells investors to watch on the dominance chart include a rejection from the resistance trendline, where the dominance currently lies above 65%. There is also support for the dominance, as shown by the yellow line in the chart below. A break below this support is critical for the fall in the dominance. Another development to watch out for is for rising Ethereum strength. In the past, the Ethereum price starting to outperform the Bitcoin price has often signaled the start of the altcoin season. So, as the ETHBTC chart begins to strengthen and Bitcoin succumbs to sideways movement, it opens the door for altcoins to rally into the next altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move In the event of a break from the resistance trendline, the analyst sees the possibility of a sharp decline. CoreCrypto predicts a 36.91% drop to the 42%-45% levels. This is lower compared to previous altcoin seasons, but follows the declining trend of a 50.79% drop in 2017 compared to a 45.10% drop in 2021. \u201cIf BTC.D gets rejected from this resistance again, it could mark the start of the long-awaited Altseason 2025,\u201d the crypto analyst explained. \u201cA breakdown from this wedge would likely result in capital rotation from BTC into altcoins \u2014 just like in previous cycles.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

Related Reading: Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout Bitcoin Holds Crucial Range Bitcoin&#8217;s price ended the second quarter with a retest of the $108,000 barrier before being rejected and closing Q2 and June around the $107,140 area, its highest monthly close in history. Despite the positive performance, the flagship crypto started July with a pullback toward the $105,000, hitting a one-week low of $105,623. Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that this suggested BTC\u2019s post-breakout retest is in progress, which would strengthen the cryptocurrency\u2019s case for another leg up. The analyst previously explained that Bitcoin needed a weekly close above the $104,400 support after losing it, as reclaiming this area would solidify its price recovery and position the cryptocurrency for a retest and confirmation of this level. Additionally, it would continue building its base around this area to transition into BTC\u2019s second Discovery Uptrend. According to the Tuesday analysis, the new weekly close suggests Bitcoin is positioned for another post-breakout retest. The analyst also noted that, in the past 40 days, BTC broke out of two 2-week downtrends but was rejected from the crucial 6-week downtrend, around the $108,000 mark, during the same timeframe. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted the rejection from this level, affirming that \u201cit is mandatory for bulls to step in quickly and not allow the price to have too big of a dip.\u201d The flagship crypto needs a \u201cstrong bounce from the most important support and resistance level, just at $106-104K,\u201d which it has momentarily held. To the analyst, failing to hold this area would open the door for a bigger pullback, risking a drop to the Macro support between $101,000 and $102,000. He highlighted a big gap between the current support area and the Macro support, which formed on the recent price recovery. BTC Risks Massive Drop In Q3 Sjuul pointed out that below the $101,000 support, \u201cthere is not much to defend the price from falling much lower,\u201d adding that the \u201chistorical quarterly return of BTC for Q3 has not been great, so this adds some extra caution to the picture we have taken from the chart.\u201d Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades asserted that historical data shows that Q3 is generally the slowest period for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) due to the decreasing activity, volume, and liquidity during the summer months. He added that, as a new quarter and month begin, BTC will likely see a \u201cchoppy start,\u201d but Bitcoin is still consolidating within its current range and descending channel, suggesting that investors should give it time to \u201cplay out and watch for confirmations\u201d of the direction it will take for the rest of the month.

Notably, the same signal appeared in 2015 and 2018, with BTC retracing over 75% and 85% after the indicator flashed. If it follows its historical performance, the analyst forecasted that BTC could drop to the $40,000 mark this quarter.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-defies-market-dip-as-usdt-activity-and-drawdown-metric-signal-growth/",
      "summary": "While the broader crypto market experienced a downturn with a 2.7% decline in total market cap over the past 24 hours, TRON (TRX) managed to move in the opposite direction. TRX recorded a 0.6% gain during the same timeframe, bringing its current trading price to $0.2788. Zooming out to a weekly view, TRON has posted a 2.4% increase, standing out among major assets amid an otherwise lukewarm market. This movement has caught the attention of on-chain analysts tracking deeper signals in the TRON ecosystem. According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, TRON\u2019s long-term price behavior reveals increasing resilience and a diminishing susceptibility to extreme volatility. Related Reading: Tron\u2019s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered\u2014Here\u2019s Who Was Behind It Reduced Drawdowns Point to Market Maturity In a recent post titled \u201cTRX Drawdowns Highlight Growing Resilience,\u201d Darkfost shared drawdown analysis as evidence that TRON has become structurally more stable over time. He explained that drawdown metrics, which measure the peak-to-trough decline in an asset\u2019s price, can serve as a reliable tool for identifying strategic market entry points. Darkfost highlighted four major TRX drawdown periods since 2020: a 61% drop in March 2020, a 70% fall in June 2021, a 55% decline in January 2022, and a 40% decrease in January 2025. Each of these correction phases was followed by significant recoveries. However, the drawdown depth has consistently decreased with each cycle, a development the analyst interprets as a sign of increasing investor confidence and capital retention in the TRON network. \u201cWith TRX now trading around $0.27, each of these drawdowns has proven to be profitable in hindsight,\u201d Darkfost noted. He added that the trend suggests that TRON is evolving into a more stable asset class with stronger market positioning. Contributing to this stability is the ongoing flow of capital and growing ecosystem usage, particularly for stablecoin transactions. TRON has become a dominant layer for Tether (USDT) transfers, and data from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn supports this view. TRON Surpasses Ethereum in Stablecoin Settlement In a separate post, Maartunn reported that TRON processed a record $23.4 billion in daily USDT transfers on June 25, 2025, an all-time high for the network. This figure significantly surpasses the $9.9 billion handled by Ethereum on the same day, highlighting the divergence between the two blockchains. Maartunn pointed out that TRON has outperformed Ethereum in USDT transfer volume since mid-2022, noting that the gap between the two networks continues to widen. \u201cThe chart doesn\u2019t just show a record; it highlights the growing gap between TRON and Ethereum,\u201d he wrote. While Ethereum\u2019s USDT activity has declined roughly 39% since its November 2024 peak, TRON remains in an upward trend. This transition signals a growing role for TRON as the main settlement layer for Tether transactions, while Ethereum appears to be shifting toward other use cases.
