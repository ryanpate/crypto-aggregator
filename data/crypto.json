      "summary": "An AI startup founder and vocal XRP supporter on the social media platform X has offered his long-awaited price prediction for the cryptocurrency. XRP&#8217;s price action in recent days has been highlighted by a quick surge to $2.30 on June 30, in what looks like the bulls trying to close the month of June above $2.20. That momentum, however, was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency has slipped back below this level in the most recent two days. Although momentum has not yet returned in full, bullish predictions are still active, and this latest prediction adds another confident voice to the growing chorus of those expecting a significant breakout. XRP Price As High As $20 To $30 Taking to the social media platform, Vincent Van Code, an AI startup founder, offered his personal price outlook for XRP. He explained that while he rarely comments on specific targets, he believes the asset has the potential to reach between $30 and $50. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 However, it is important to note that this reasoning is not rooted in technical analysis, but rather in belief and long-term conviction based on XRP&#8217;s current price trajectory. Furthermore, he noted that his investment in XRP is shaped by this personal view of a $20 to $30 price target and admitted he cannot predict the timing of such a rally. The details of how the journey plays out to this price target are far less important than the eventual outcome. It is clear that the ultra-bullish price prediction is not intended to persuade or convince others. However, it shows the confidence some traders have in XRP&#8217;s future price. It also resonates with many predictions from other crypto participants regarding XRP, both in terms of technical and fundamental analysis. Familiar Price Predictions Within The Altcoin&#8217;s Circle This prediction aligns with a broader sense of optimism often found among XRP supporters. Although some critics continue to argue that price targets of $30 or more are unrealistic, especially due to its huge circulating supply, many in the XRP community continue to see such price targets as attainable. Related Reading: Deaton Says Ripple IPO Could Trigger $100B Valuation, How High Will The XRP Price Be? The beliefs of extravagant XRP price targets are often based on its fundamentals, mostly on expectations of widespread adoption in cross-border payments and institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. In fact, one analyst pointed to this as the reason why the XRP price will surge above $1,000, stabilize at this level, and eventually become very expensive. Technical analysis from crypto analyst JackTheRippler pointed to an incoming price target above $30 for XRP. In a similar vein, a recent technical analysis by popular crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO shows that the altcoin is on track to climb above $9.5 and reach as high as $37.5. XRP rallied to as high as $2.30 on June 30, and then reversed to an intraday low of $2.15 in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-next-direction-uncertain/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is holding steady above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), showing signs of underlying strength despite a lack of clear directional momentum. With rising trading volume and mixed technical indicators, the next move could swing either way, keeping the market on edge. RSI Holds Neutral As Bitcoin Awaits A Clearer Signal According to Shaco AI, in a recent update on X, Bitcoin is currently hovering around $107,264.17, positioning itself just above two key moving averages. It\u2019s nudging the 25-day SMA at $107,229.82 and holding slightly above the 50-day SMA, which sits at $107,040.81. This positioning reflects a mild bullish bias in recent sessions, keeping both bulls and bears on alert. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance Looking at momentum indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is resting at 53.36\u2014firmly in neutral territory. This suggests that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold at the moment, offering no strong directional clues as it keeps the market guessing. Furthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX) adds to this indecisive mood, coming in at a soft 20.44. This low reading signals a weak trend, meaning there\u2019s not enough force from bulls or bears to drive a clear breakout just yet. In other words, the market isn\u2019t leaning heavily in either direction. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory at -137.33. Although it isn\u2019t signaling any strong downward momentum, traders may want to stay cautious and alert for any sudden shift in the current tone. Despite the technical indecision, market activity is picking up. Bitcoin&#8217;s recent trading volume has surged to 1903.51, well above the average of 1522.43. This uptick signals a rise in interest and participation, indicating that traders are actively positioning themselves in anticipation of Bitcoin\u2019s next move. Critical Zones At Play As Market Prepares For A Directional Push Looking at key levels, Shaco AI highlighted that resistance is at $108,789.99, which seems to be a strong level to overcome. The level marks a significant ceiling for Bitcoin, and any attempt to push higher will need solid momentum to break through. On the other hand, support lies at $104,622.02. This support level will be critical in case the price begins to retreat, as a breakdown here could open the door for further downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $110,000: Why BTC Must Break Out Of This Wedge Based on current indicators, the analyst suggests it\u2019s wise to keep an eye out for potential movement in either direction.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bounces-off-key-demand-level-price-discovery-on-the-menu/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has experienced heightened volatility over the past few days, moving between critical levels as market participants await a clear breakout or breakdown. After testing $105,000 as support, BTC rebounded strongly and pushed back toward the $109,000 resistance zone\u2014an area that has capped upward momentum for several weeks. While bulls remain in control of the broader structure, price action continues to show hesitation just below the all-time high, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High To confirm the next leg of the long-term trend, Bitcoin needs to break into price discovery territory above $112,000 with strong volume and follow-through. Until that happens, the current range-bound conditions could persist, especially as traders weigh macro factors and profit-taking activity increases. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis pointing to another strong bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster, key dynamic support levels that have repeatedly triggered bullish reactions. This bounce reinforces the underlying strength in the current trend, suggesting that buyers continue to step in at crucial levels. As long as BTC holds above this support zone, the path toward a breakout remains intact\u2014but confirmation is still needed. Bitcoin Prepares For Expansion Phase Bitcoin appears poised to enter a new expansive phase, with a breakout above its all-time high potentially triggering a fresh wave of bullish momentum, not just for BTC, but for the broader crypto market. After weeks of grinding just below the $112,000 resistance level, Bitcoin has struggled to push decisively higher. However, the structure remains bullish, and buyers have consistently defended key demand zones around $105,000. This ability to maintain higher lows during a period of consolidation signals strong market control by the bulls. According to Jelle, Bitcoin has just seen another powerful bounce from the 50-day moving average and exponential moving average (MA/EMA) cluster\u2014an area that has historically acted as a dynamic support zone. Each time BTC has touched this cluster in recent months, it has rebounded with renewed strength, and the latest bounce is no exception. Jelle believes this reaction confirms the uptrend remains intact, with conditions aligning for a breakout. \u201cThe trend is up\u2014new all-time highs are very much on the menu this week,\u201d Jelle noted, emphasizing the importance of sustained momentum above current resistance. If Bitcoin can close decisively above $112K, it would likely ignite a surge in altcoins, many of which have lagged during BTC\u2019s dominance-driven phase. With bulls maintaining control and technical support holding firm, the market is now watching for confirmation that Bitcoin is ready to enter price discovery once again. A successful breakout could mark the beginning of the next major leg in the crypto cycle.

The 12-hour chart shows a series of failed breakouts above the $109K level in recent weeks, highlighting the strength of this resistance zone. However, bulls have continued to defend higher lows, maintaining overall market structure and preventing deeper corrections. The latest candle shows a 1.93% surge, reclaiming the 50- and 100-period moving averages around $106,000, a key short-term cluster that previously acted as support. Volume also picked up during this bounce, suggesting renewed buying interest as Bitcoin tries to establish bullish momentum.

If BTC fails to break and close above this range soon, the risk of a return to the $103,600 demand zone increases, especially in the face of rising volatility and profit-taking across the network.

      "summary": "The \u2018MicroStrategy\u2019 of Ethereum has emerged, with Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee and Joe Lubin making moves to advance their respective ETH treasuries. Tom Lee has emerged as the Chairman of BitMine, which will hold ETH, while Lubin is already the Chairman of SharpLink Gaming. Lee and Lubin Raise $675 Million for Ethereum Treasury Strategy Tom Lee and Joe Lubin have already advanced their plans to create the \u2018MicroStrategy\u2019 of Ethereum. On Tom Lee\u2019s end, BitMine announced a $250 million private placement to raise capital for its Ethereum strategy. The Bitcoin mining company stated that the net proceeds of the offering will be used to acquire ETH, which will become the firm\u2019s primary reserve asset. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here\u2019s Why BitMine plans to close this private placement on or about July 3, as it aims to become one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders with Tom Lee as the Chairman of the Board. On the other hand, SharpLink Gaming, with Joe Lubin\u2019s help, is already the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder. The company earlier launched its Ethereum treasury with a $425 million ETH purchase. SharpLink Gaming recently announced that it has increased its total ETH holdings to 198,167 ($475 million), further establishing its position as the \u2018MicroStrategy\u2019 of Ethereum. Between June 23 and 30, it acquired 9,468 ETH for $22.8 million at an average price of $2,411 per ETH. During that same period, SharpLink Gaming also raised an additional $24.4 million through its At-The-Market (ATM) facility, selling $2.5 million shares. The company revealed that most of the proceeds will go toward further Ethereum acquisitions. As of June 30th, 100% of its ETH is staked, and the firm has earned 222 ETH in rewards since it began an ETH treasury company. Plans To Mirror Saylor\u2019s Strategy In an X post, crypto commentator Eric Conner commented on how Ethereum is getting its own MicroStrategy era thanks to Lee and Lubin\u2019s experiments. He highlighted BitMine\u2019s proposed KPI of \u2018ETH per share,\u2019 which mirrors Saylor\u2019s playbook, except that ETH earns yield in this instance through staking. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor\u2019s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Conner further remarked that BitMine\u2019s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum. On the other hand, he noted that Joe Lubin and SharpLink Gaming\u2019s move is bigger. SharpLink is already staking its ETH holdings and plans to explore other DeFi strategies. With this move, the crypto commentator declared that ETH becomes the reserve while yielding bankroll growth. Lubin also recently raised the possibility of adding leverage to SharpLink Gaming\u2019s Ethereum strategy, which will mirror Saylor\u2019s strategy. He stated that they may do convertible equity and issue bonds at low rates, without putting the strategy at risk. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,444, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-under-0-20-is-free-predicts-2000-upside/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin is revisiting a technical juncture it has not seen since the months preceding its 2020\u201321 parabolic rally, according to a comparative chart published by the pseudonymous analyst Kaleo to his 705,000 followers on X. In the annotated TradingView graphic, weekly candles for DOGE-USD trace two multi-year falling wedge structures\u2014one stretching from the January 2018 high to early 2021, and an almost mirror-image pattern extending from the May 2021 peak until today. History Repeating For Dogecoin? The first wedge resolved in late 2020 with a decisive breakout above a descending trend-line that had capped every rally for more than thirty-six months. Kaleo marks that moment with a yellow label reading \u201cWe are here\u201d at roughly $0.003, immediately before the price detonated to the cycle top near $0.75 in May 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit The current structure shows the same downward-sloping resistance\u2014now anchored by successive lower highs from $0.16 in late 2022 to $0.11 in late 2023\u2014finally giving way. Since the, DOGE has recorded higher highs in April at $0.22 and in December 2024 at $0.48. Friday\u2019s close printed at $0.1604, still below the psychological $0.20 threshold but fractionally above the dotted secondary resistance that has defined the wedge\u2019s upper boundary since mid-2022. Kaleo\u2019s overlay projects the 2020 breakout trajectory forward in time, mapping a near-vertical thrust from the present $0.16 area to roughly $0.55, a brief consolidation, and a continuation leg that tops close to $3.50. While this upper target hasn\u2019t ever been printed in DOGE\u2019s history, the analyst\u2019s replica path underscores how little overhead structure exists once price escapes the wedge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal\u2014But One Move Could Ruin It A key role in the chart are playing the two vertical dashed lines labeled \u201cBTC Halving\u201d: 12 May 2020 and 21 April 2024. In Kaleo\u2019s read, Dogecoin\u2019s macro reversals are synchronized with Bitcoin\u2019s quadrennial supply shock, implying that the breakout could be a post-halving echo of the 2020 move. Price construction within the wedge also mirrors the earlier cycle: successive lower highs and higher lows compress volatility until an impulsive weekly bar pierces resistance. The horizontal line intersecting the new breakout\u2014will be the first major test of post-wedge momentum. Below, the lower dashed boundary intersects in the region between $0.10 and $0.09; a weekly close beneath that floor would invalidate the fractal. Kaleo distills the setup into a single line: \u201cDogecoin under 20 cents is free.\u201d On the chart\u2019s scale, the red quote-box at $0.1604 sits a hair\u2019s breadth under the $0.20 psychological band, reinforcing the idea that the risk-to-reward profile remains asymmetric so long as price stays below that number. Whether history rhymes as precisely as the analyst\u2019s fractal suggests will hinge on broader market liquidity and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, but from a purely structural perspective the meme-coin has already checked the same boxes it did four years ago. And the US Federal Reserve money printer hasn\u2019t even started roaring again. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.161. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
