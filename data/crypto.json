      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to reclaim a crucial area amid its recent price recovery, which could propel the flagship crypto toward new highs. Some analysts suggested that BTC is preparing for the \u201cfinal resistance,\u201d while others warned that it still risks a potential pullback to lower levels. Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 \u2013 Is A Recovery Around The Corner? Bitcoin Rally Eyes Next Resistance Bitcoin has finally regained significant bullish momentum after printing a massive daily candle on Monday. The flagship crypto recently lost its post-all-time high (ATH) range of $106,800-$109,700, sparking concern among some investors. Amid the recent market pullbacks, which began in late May, the flagship crypto also registered some volatility, losing key levels as support and hitting a one-month low near the $100,000 level last week. However, BTC reclaimed the $105,000 mark over the weekend before surging above the $106,800 crucial resistance on Monday. Following this performance, analyst Rekt Capital stated that Bitcoin has successfully retested the $104,400 re-accumulation range high resistance as new support for four weeks. He highlighted that BTC was \u201crebounding from this new support base in an effort to transition into Price Discovery again.\u201d Additionally, Bitcoin ended its two-week downtrend, recording a Daily Close around the $110,500 area. Per the analyst, BTC \u201chas skipped through the $106,600-$109,443 Daily Range entirely,\u201d and is \u201conce again positioning itself like in late May for a retest\u201d of the range\u2019s high as support, which propelled the price to its ATH last month. A daily close above the $109,443 level would set up BTC for a revisit of the \u201cfinal Daily resistance,\u201d around the $111,723 mark, before a new ATH. The analyst also affirmed that reclaiming the \u201cfinal weekly resistance\u201d of $108,900 as support would also add to BTC\u2019s momentum. BTC In A &#8216;Dangerous Area&#8217;? Analyst Crypto Jelle suggested that turning the $108,000 price area into support could send Bitcoin to the price discovery phase, potentially targeting the $120,000 mark. He noted that previous unsuccessful breakout attempts failed to reclaim this level, but that the cryptocurrency is currently holding this area. Based on a multi-month pattern, Jelle also reaffirmed its $140,000-$150,000 target for BTC\u2019s cycle top. The analyst highlighted a major inverted Head and Shoulders pattern forming since the end of 2024. According to"

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the veterans of the Bitcoin market are taking 89% less profits compared to the May peak, despite prices being similar now. Bitcoin Realized Profit For 1Y+ Hands Is Relatively Low Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Realized Profit of the seasoned hands on the Bitcoin network. The &#8220;Realized Profit&#8221; refers to an indicator that measures, as its name implies, the amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being transacted or &#8216;sold&#8217; on the chain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If the previous selling value is less than the current price for any token, then that particular token&#8217;s sale is contributing to profit realization. Related Reading: Toncoin Heading Toward 40% Breakout, Pattern Could Suggest The amount of profit realized in the sale is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this value for all tokens being transferred to find the total for the network as a whole. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Profit of the entire userbase isn&#8217;t of interest, but just that of a specific part of it: the 1+ year holders. These are the investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than a year, without having involved them in a transaction even once. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their tokens, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, this part of the userbase with its significant holding time would include the resolute diamond hands of the market. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit for these HODLers over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit of the 1+ year investors observed a huge spike in late May. This sharp profit-taking spree from these seasoned hands came as BTC surged to $110,000 following its post all-time high (ATH) pullback. Shortly after the selloff from this cohort, BTC started on a decline. During the past day, though, the asset has appeared to have finally shoved off this bearish momentum, as it has once more returned above the $109,000 mark. This time, however, there hasn&#8217;t been any significant reaction from the diamond hands. Currently, the 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) of the group&#8217;s Realized Profit sits at $13.6 million, which is 89% down compared to the $126 million peak from last month.

      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, may finally be awakening from its slumber. It recently flashed a bullish golden cross on the daily chart &#8211; a signal that has many crypto analysts forecasting a potential new all-time high (ATH) in the near future. Ethereum Flashes Bullish Golden Cross In an X post published today, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH has formed a golden cross on its daily chart. He shared the following chart and remarked that bullish momentum appears to be building for Ethereum. To explain, a golden cross is a bullish technical pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average (MA) &#8211; typically the 50-day &#8211; crosses above a long-term MA like the 200-day. It signals a potential shift in momentum and is often seen as an indicator of a sustained upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 \u2013 Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez commented on ETH\u2019s recent price action. He noted that Ethereum has broken resistance on the 4-hour chart and could be setting up for a move as high as $2,920 in the coming days. Fellow market commentator Ted Pillows echoed a similar view. He stated that ETH is currently trading at a local range high, pushing against a key resistance level at $2,800. Pillows suggested that the digital asset might reach $4,000 later this month. Multiple technical indicators and market structure patterns are also hinting at near-term upside for ETH. For instance, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader observed a hidden bullish divergence on the 12-hour chart. A hidden bullish divergence occurs when price forms a higher low, while a momentum indicator &#8211; such as RSI or MACD &#8211; forms a lower low. This setup suggests that although momentum appears weak, the underlying trend remains intact, and a price continuation to the upside is likely. In a similar vein, digital assets analyst Crypto Caesar pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s Wyckoff Accumulation pattern is \u201cstill playing out perfectly.\u201d He shared a chart predicting that ETH may hit a new all-time high by August 2025. All Indicators Point To Further Upside Beyond the technical patterns, other on-chain and market indicators continue to support the bullish thesis. For instance, even after gaining over 11% in the past two weeks, Ethereum\u2019s funding rates remain relatively neutral &#8211; a sign that the rally may still have room to grow.

      "summary": "Tron (TRX) has experienced positive price action recently, aligning with the upward trend seen across the broader cryptocurrency market. In the past 24 hours, TRX climbed approximately 3.9%, reaching a trading value of $0.294. Despite these recent gains, Tron remains significantly below its all-time high of $0.43, set in December 2024, representing roughly a 31.8% decrease from that peak. This upward trajectory coincides with notable stablecoin activity on the Tron network, particularly involving Tether&#8217;s USDT token. Recently, a substantial minting event involving USDT occurred, signaling increased liquidity and potential market demand. Related Reading: TRON Surges Past 8 Million Daily Transactions as TRX Holds Above $0.27 Significant USDT Minting Event on Tron Amr Taha, an analyst from CryptoQuant&#8217;s QuickTake Platform, highlighted a significant event occurring on the Tron blockchain involving Tether&#8217;s stablecoin, USDT. According to Taha\u2019s report titled &#8220;Tether Treasury mints $1 billion USDT on TRON prior to Bitcoin reaching $110,000,&#8221; the Tether Treasury recently issued 1 billion new USDT tokens on the Tron blockchain on June 9, 2025. This mint represents the largest single issuance of USDT on Tron for the month so far, emphasizing the network&#8217;s increasing relevance for stablecoin transactions. Taha noted that two primary factors likely drove this sizable minting event. First, it points toward elevated market demand for stablecoins, particularly within Tron\u2019s ecosystem, known for low transaction fees and high-speed transfers. Second, the minting could signal significant institutional activity or preparations for substantial over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trades. Historically, such minting events tend to precede increased trading activity as investors leverage newly injected liquidity into the markets. The introduction of additional stablecoin liquidity typically boosts overall cryptocurrency market conditions, potentially providing support during periods when traditional financial markets are less robust. Divergent Trends: Rising TRX Price and Declining TVL Meanwhile, separate on-chain analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson noted a sharp decrease of nearly $2 billion in the total value locked (TVL) within lending protocols on Tron. This recent drop in TVL contrasts notably with the rising price of TRX, marking a divergence that raises intriguing questions for investors. Wedson pointed out that historically, reduced TVL in lending platforms on Tron has correlated with upward price movements for TRX, as previously observed in early 2024. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Reason Behind Tron Price Sluggishness \u2014 Are TRX Bears Now In Control? However, the current scenario, where TRX\u2019s value continues to climb despite significant reductions in lending protocol engagement, may hint at underlying shifts in investor strategies or possible structural changes within the network&#8217;s financial ecosystem.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/why-bitcoin-calm-rally-could-be-a-setup-for-a-massive-breakout-analyst-reveals/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has returned to an upward trajectory, with the asset posting a 1.7% gain in the last 24 hours to reach $109,505. This marks a 4% increase in the past week, placing the cryptocurrency less than 2% below its all-time high of $111,000 set last month. The move follows a period of subdued market activity, with recent gains occurring in a relatively quiet trading environment. Analysts have looked into on-chain indicators for signals of whether the current price action is sustainable or approaching overheated levels. Particularly, unlike previous rallies driven by sharp price spikes and speculative retail demand, the latest growth appears more measured. This has prompted the assessment of metrics such as Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), MVRV ratio, and exchange premium indexes to gauge underlying investor behavior and sentiment. Related Reading: BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Becomes Fastest Ever To Reach $70 Billion AUM Bitcoin Long-Term Holders and US Demand Drive Quiet Accumulation According to an analysis published on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform by contributor Avocado Onchain, Bitcoin\u2019s current rally is taking shape under relatively stable conditions. The analyst points to a declining 30-day moving average of Binary CDD, a metric that tracks the spending behavior of long-term holders. The decrease suggests that these holders are not yet exiting the market, indicating a continued confidence in the asset\u2019s potential for further gains. Another notable indicator cited in the analysis is the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the difference between Bitcoin prices on US-based Coinbase and other global exchanges. This premium is increasing and nearing levels observed during Bitcoin\u2019s prior peaks in March and December 2024. While elevated premiums can be a warning sign of overheating, Avocado notes that the Korea Premium Index remains low, suggesting muted activity from retail traders in Asia. This balance implies that institutional buying pressure, particularly from US-based investors, could be driving the recent momentum. In addition, the MVRV ratio, a comparison of Bitcoin\u2019s market value to its realized value, has been rising gradually without any sharp jumps. This suggests that the market has not entered an extreme greed phase, further reinforcing the idea that the current uptrend may have more room to run. Avocado wrote: In summary, rather than anticipating a correction, the current indicators suggest that Bitcoin may have further room to grow, and this could be a time to carefully monitor the potential for continued upside. Whale Activity and Institutional Inflows Signal Market Confidence In a separate post, another CryptoQuant contributor known as Crypto Dan highlighted consistent buying activity from larger market players. His report notes that the Coinbase Premium has been climbing steadily since April 21, indicating increased demand from US investors. This trend, combined with observations of whale accumulation, points to a strengthening market foundation despite the absence of exuberant price behavior. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here The analyst further noted that such patterns are characteristic of post-correction recovery phases in Bitcoin\u2019s historical price cycles. So far, the combination of long-term holder conviction, institutional demand, and subdued retail activity suggests the rally may be advancing on more stable footing than prior surges.
