      "summary": "On-chain data shows the veterans of the Bitcoin market are taking 89% less profits compared to the May peak, despite prices being similar now. Bitcoin Realized Profit For 1Y+ Hands Is Relatively Low Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Realized Profit of the seasoned hands on the Bitcoin network. The &#8220;Realized Profit&#8221; refers to an indicator that measures, as its name implies, the amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being transacted or &#8216;sold&#8217; on the chain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If the previous selling value is less than the current price for any token, then that particular token&#8217;s sale is contributing to profit realization. Related Reading: Toncoin Heading Toward 40% Breakout, Pattern Could Suggest The amount of profit realized in the sale is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit sums up this value for all tokens being transferred to find the total for the network as a whole. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Profit of the entire userbase isn&#8217;t of interest, but just that of a specific part of it: the 1+ year holders. These are the investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than a year, without having involved them in a transaction even once. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their tokens, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, this part of the userbase with its significant holding time would include the resolute diamond hands of the market. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit for these HODLers over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit of the 1+ year investors observed a huge spike in late May. This sharp profit-taking spree from these seasoned hands came as BTC surged to $110,000 following its post all-time high (ATH) pullback. Shortly after the selloff from this cohort, BTC started on a decline. During the past day, though, the asset has appeared to have finally shoved off this bearish momentum, as it has once more returned above the $109,000 mark. This time, however, there hasn&#8217;t been any significant reaction from the diamond hands. Currently, the 24-hour simple moving average (SMA) of the group&#8217;s Realized Profit sits at $13.6 million, which is 89% down compared to the $126 million peak from last month.

      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, may finally be awakening from its slumber. It recently flashed a bullish golden cross on the daily chart &#8211; a signal that has many crypto analysts forecasting a potential new all-time high (ATH) in the near future. Ethereum Flashes Bullish Golden Cross In an X post published today, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that ETH has formed a golden cross on its daily chart. He shared the following chart and remarked that bullish momentum appears to be building for Ethereum. To explain, a golden cross is a bullish technical pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average (MA) &#8211; typically the 50-day &#8211; crosses above a long-term MA like the 200-day. It signals a potential shift in momentum and is often seen as an indicator of a sustained upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 \u2013 Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez commented on ETH\u2019s recent price action. He noted that Ethereum has broken resistance on the 4-hour chart and could be setting up for a move as high as $2,920 in the coming days. Fellow market commentator Ted Pillows echoed a similar view. He stated that ETH is currently trading at a local range high, pushing against a key resistance level at $2,800. Pillows suggested that the digital asset might reach $4,000 later this month. Multiple technical indicators and market structure patterns are also hinting at near-term upside for ETH. For instance, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader observed a hidden bullish divergence on the 12-hour chart. A hidden bullish divergence occurs when price forms a higher low, while a momentum indicator &#8211; such as RSI or MACD &#8211; forms a lower low. This setup suggests that although momentum appears weak, the underlying trend remains intact, and a price continuation to the upside is likely. In a similar vein, digital assets analyst Crypto Caesar pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s Wyckoff Accumulation pattern is \u201cstill playing out perfectly.\u201d He shared a chart predicting that ETH may hit a new all-time high by August 2025. All Indicators Point To Further Upside Beyond the technical patterns, other on-chain and market indicators continue to support the bullish thesis. For instance, even after gaining over 11% in the past two weeks, Ethereum\u2019s funding rates remain relatively neutral &#8211; a sign that the rally may still have room to grow.

      "summary": "Tron (TRX) has experienced positive price action recently, aligning with the upward trend seen across the broader cryptocurrency market. In the past 24 hours, TRX climbed approximately 3.9%, reaching a trading value of $0.294. Despite these recent gains, Tron remains significantly below its all-time high of $0.43, set in December 2024, representing roughly a 31.8% decrease from that peak. This upward trajectory coincides with notable stablecoin activity on the Tron network, particularly involving Tether&#8217;s USDT token. Recently, a substantial minting event involving USDT occurred, signaling increased liquidity and potential market demand. Related Reading: TRON Surges Past 8 Million Daily Transactions as TRX Holds Above $0.27 Significant USDT Minting Event on Tron Amr Taha, an analyst from CryptoQuant&#8217;s QuickTake Platform, highlighted a significant event occurring on the Tron blockchain involving Tether&#8217;s stablecoin, USDT. According to Taha\u2019s report titled &#8220;Tether Treasury mints $1 billion USDT on TRON prior to Bitcoin reaching $110,000,&#8221; the Tether Treasury recently issued 1 billion new USDT tokens on the Tron blockchain on June 9, 2025. This mint represents the largest single issuance of USDT on Tron for the month so far, emphasizing the network&#8217;s increasing relevance for stablecoin transactions. Taha noted that two primary factors likely drove this sizable minting event. First, it points toward elevated market demand for stablecoins, particularly within Tron\u2019s ecosystem, known for low transaction fees and high-speed transfers. Second, the minting could signal significant institutional activity or preparations for substantial over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trades. Historically, such minting events tend to precede increased trading activity as investors leverage newly injected liquidity into the markets. The introduction of additional stablecoin liquidity typically boosts overall cryptocurrency market conditions, potentially providing support during periods when traditional financial markets are less robust. Divergent Trends: Rising TRX Price and Declining TVL Meanwhile, separate on-chain analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson noted a sharp decrease of nearly $2 billion in the total value locked (TVL) within lending protocols on Tron. This recent drop in TVL contrasts notably with the rising price of TRX, marking a divergence that raises intriguing questions for investors. Wedson pointed out that historically, reduced TVL in lending platforms on Tron has correlated with upward price movements for TRX, as previously observed in early 2024. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Reason Behind Tron Price Sluggishness \u2014 Are TRX Bears Now In Control? However, the current scenario, where TRX\u2019s value continues to climb despite significant reductions in lending protocol engagement, may hint at underlying shifts in investor strategies or possible structural changes within the network&#8217;s financial ecosystem.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has returned to an upward trajectory, with the asset posting a 1.7% gain in the last 24 hours to reach $109,505. This marks a 4% increase in the past week, placing the cryptocurrency less than 2% below its all-time high of $111,000 set last month. The move follows a period of subdued market activity, with recent gains occurring in a relatively quiet trading environment. Analysts have looked into on-chain indicators for signals of whether the current price action is sustainable or approaching overheated levels. Particularly, unlike previous rallies driven by sharp price spikes and speculative retail demand, the latest growth appears more measured. This has prompted the assessment of metrics such as Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), MVRV ratio, and exchange premium indexes to gauge underlying investor behavior and sentiment. Related Reading: BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Becomes Fastest Ever To Reach $70 Billion AUM Bitcoin Long-Term Holders and US Demand Drive Quiet Accumulation According to an analysis published on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform by contributor Avocado Onchain, Bitcoin\u2019s current rally is taking shape under relatively stable conditions. The analyst points to a declining 30-day moving average of Binary CDD, a metric that tracks the spending behavior of long-term holders. The decrease suggests that these holders are not yet exiting the market, indicating a continued confidence in the asset\u2019s potential for further gains. Another notable indicator cited in the analysis is the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the difference between Bitcoin prices on US-based Coinbase and other global exchanges. This premium is increasing and nearing levels observed during Bitcoin\u2019s prior peaks in March and December 2024. While elevated premiums can be a warning sign of overheating, Avocado notes that the Korea Premium Index remains low, suggesting muted activity from retail traders in Asia. This balance implies that institutional buying pressure, particularly from US-based investors, could be driving the recent momentum. In addition, the MVRV ratio, a comparison of Bitcoin\u2019s market value to its realized value, has been rising gradually without any sharp jumps. This suggests that the market has not entered an extreme greed phase, further reinforcing the idea that the current uptrend may have more room to run. Avocado wrote: In summary, rather than anticipating a correction, the current indicators suggest that Bitcoin may have further room to grow, and this could be a time to carefully monitor the potential for continued upside. Whale Activity and Institutional Inflows Signal Market Confidence In a separate post, another CryptoQuant contributor known as Crypto Dan highlighted consistent buying activity from larger market players. His report notes that the Coinbase Premium has been climbing steadily since April 21, indicating increased demand from US investors. This trend, combined with observations of whale accumulation, points to a strengthening market foundation despite the absence of exuberant price behavior. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here The analyst further noted that such patterns are characteristic of post-correction recovery phases in Bitcoin\u2019s historical price cycles. So far, the combination of long-term holder conviction, institutional demand, and subdued retail activity suggests the rally may be advancing on more stable footing than prior surges.

      "summary": "XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.265 zone. The price is now consolidating and might aim for an upward move above the $2.30 resistance. XRP price started a decent upward move above the $2.250 zone. The price is now trading above $2.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2.2750 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP Price Consolidates Gains XRP price formed a base and started a fresh increase from the $2.10 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $2.150 and $2.20 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $2.25 level. Finally, the price tested the $2.320 resistance. A high was formed at $2.3294 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high. The price is now trading above $2.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a bullish trend line forming with support at $2.2750 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.30 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.320 level. The next resistance is $2.350. A clear move above the $2.350 resistance might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.420 resistance or even $2.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $2.30 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.2750 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.250 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.220 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone.
