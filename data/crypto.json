      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-break-above-118000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has rallied massively over the past seven days by posting an impressive price gain of nearly 9% after climbing from around $108,300 to almost $118,800. This move was quite surprising, particularly as the process saw Bitcoin clearing its previous all-time high from late May by breaking above $111,970. But according to Bitcoin technical analyst CryptoCon, this breakout may just be the beginning. In a recent post on the social media platform X, CryptoCon revealed a long-term cycle pattern that points to a more ambitious price target for Bitcoin. Analyst Unveils BTC&#8217;s Golden Number For This Cycle In a recent post on social media platform X, CryptoCon revealed a long-term cycle pattern that points to a more ambitious target for Bitcoin. His analysis is based on the 5.618 Fibonacci extension, which is a number he says has perfectly aligned with every prior cycle top. The projection opens up the possibility of whether Bitcoin\u2019s current move marks the start of another parabolic run. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It\u2019s Now \u2018Illegal\u2019 To Short Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why CryptoCon\u2019s technical chart analysis builds on the recurring 5.618 Fibonacci extension level in previous market cycles. The analyst shows how Bitcoin\u2019s previous tops have fallen within striking distance of this precise extension by measuring the move of each market cycle and applying this golden ratio. The chart shown below features the $30.84 peak in June 2011, the $1,205 top in November 2013, the $18,702 high from December 2017, and the peak of $63,839 in November 2021. Each of these market tops, as shown in the Bitcoin multi-year price chart below, converged on the same 5.618 multiple from their preceding bear market lows. Now, using this same approach in the ongoing cycle, CryptoCon projected that the next major step for Bitcoin is somewhere between $170,000 and $180,000. Particularly, the 5.618 Fibonacci extension points to a &#8220;Golden Number&#8221; of $184,181 for Bitcoin&#8217;s price in this cycle. Bitcoin Price Compression Is About To Expand Violently Several major forces appear to have contributed to BTC&#8217;s recent surge in the past 48 hours. A significant short squeeze earlier in the week reportedly wiped out over $1 billion in bearish positions. At the same time, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered over $1 billion in daily inflows in the past two consecutive days. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Breakdown \u2014 Here\u2019s The Best Time To Buy In his X post, CryptoCon also commented on the current state of Bitcoin\u2019s chart: \u201cAll the boring price action is coming to a squeeze; it can&#8217;t stay that way forever.\u201d This observation reflects the long period of tight, sideways trading between $105,000 and $108,000 that Bitcoin experienced in the previous two weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,762, retracing slightly after reaching its most recent all-time high of $118,667, according to CoinGecko data. Other crypto analysts now find themselves watching the $130,000 region as another zone of consolidation activity on the way to the possible cycle peak.

Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Pi Network Volume Spike Signals Fresh Interest According to on-chain data, weekly gains of 1.1% suggest renewed curiosity around the Pi Network token. Its recent push past $0.48 may have drawn eyes back to the network. A big swell in transfers shows people shifting coins more than usual, even if the price isn\u2019t following the same upward path. In the past few days, two separate moves of exactly 3.14 Pi have caught attention. Those small transfers tie back to the project\u2019s namesake, the number \u03c0. Based on reports, these sent-outs came from a single wallet\u2014labeled GASWBD\u2026\u2014which also withdrew over 10 million Pi in just six days. That same address links to about 320 million Pi in earlier activity, leading many to wonder if a big miner, an institutional backer, or someone from the Pi team is behind it. \ud83d\udd14 3.14 Pi Withdrawn \u2014 Twice in One Day: A Signal Echoing Across the Pi Network \ud83d\udd14 The Numbers Are Speaking.

They arrived just as the price flirted with the psychological $0.48 mark. Some community members see the transfers as a rallying call, a nod back to Pi\u2019s roots. Traders, though, tend to watch those numbers for clues of real buying or selling pressure. So far, the pattern looks more like a planned message than a panic sell\u2011off. Talk of a mainnet rollout or fresh exchange pairings has spread across forums. People point to the organized nature of the withdrawals as proof that bigger plans are underway. They hint that big news might be on the way\u2014maybe new partners or additions that bring Pi out of its test network and into mainline usability. Forecast: Caution Ahead According to current forecasts, the value of Pi could decrease to $ 0.35 by August 11, 2025, a decline of 25%. Technical indicators are showing Bearish, and the Fear &#38; Greed Index for the market is at 79 (Extreme Greed). Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Pi experienced 11 green days in the past 30 (37%) and recorded 9% price fluctuation over that time. That breakdown between high excitement and bearish direction is a picture of conflicting indicators for anyone considering getting on board now. So far, Pi Network is a project generating hope and skepticism. The $208 million volume increase indicates that people are indeed taking notice. But the prediction and on-chain activity suggest caution may be advisable until stronger milestones emerge. Featured image from Jeffrey Coolidge/Getty Images, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-sopr-signals-more-gains-ahead-despite-new-ath-analyst/",
      "summary": "In the past week, Bitcoin has grabbed the major headlines as prices surge to a new all-time high of $118,856 following a market gain of 9.77%. In remarkable fashion, the premier cryptocurrency added an estimated $10,000 to its market value increasing its market cap to a solid $2.34 trillion. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggest there may be more tailwind ahead backing Bitcoin\u2019s ability to explore new price territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000\u2014But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns STH SOPR Sits At 1.02, Suggests Market Not Overheating In a recent quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a market analyst with username CryptoMe has shared some compelling insights on Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory amidst current market euphoria. As earlier stated, the flagship cryptocurrency experienced a significant price gain to brush nearly against the $120,000 mark. Despite this rise, CryptoMe notes that short-term holders&#8217; spent output profit ratio (STH SOPR) indicates that this class of investors are yet to engage in significant profit-taking. For context, The STH-SOPR measures the ratio of realized profits or losses by investors who\u2019ve held BTC for less than 155 days. A STH-SOPR reading above 1.0 indicates that BTC are being sold at a profit, while values below 1.0 indicate losses. Based on the chart below, sharp increases in this on-chain metric especially into the 1.05-1.20+ range (red zone) have correlated with profit-taking phases and can often precede local tops. However, the STH-SOPR currently sits at 1.02, suggesting that although some short-term holders are in profit, no aggressive market distribution has commenced. This development is particularly bullish considering the STH realized price is presently at $100,000 indicating these investors are 17%-18% in profit and are opting to hold for further price gains. Meanwhile, the analyst notes that this present on-chain situation aligns with the broader sentiment in the derivatives market. Open Interest is climbing, signaling growing participation, but funding rates remain neutral to slightly positive. This lack of extreme funding imbalances suggests that traders are not flooding the market with overleveraged long positions due to FOMO. CryptoMe explains that all these factors indicate the Bitcoin market is far from overheating and there is still potential for more growth ahead.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst TradingShot has drawn attention to a bullish pattern for Dogecoin, indicating that a significant price surge is on the horizon. The analyst suggested that this could be the final leg up for the foremost meme coin and advised market participants not to miss it. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally With Megaphone Pattern In a TradingView post, TradingShot predicted that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $1.25. He noted that the meme coin has been trading in a bullish Megaphone pattern within a channel up. The analyst added that the recent rebound on June 16 on the weekly MA200 is a higher low at the bottom of both patterns. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price To Jump Double-Digits To $0.2 With the 1-week Relative Strength Index (RSI) also rebounding on its long-term support zone, TradingShot declared that Dogecoin is most likely at the start of a new bullish leg. He noted that this could be the final rally that will shape this cycle\u2019s top. Meanwhile, the analyst claimed that DOGE is targeting $1.25 because the previous two bullish legs peaked on the 3.618 Fibonacci extension of the last decline. He told market participants that they can settle for $0.8 if they wish to pursue a target within the Channel up. A rally to both $0.8 and $1.25 would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for Dogecoin, whose current ATH is at $0.73. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach these targets in the first half of next year. Dogecoin is expected to maintain a steady climb from now till then as it reaches those targets. The meme coin has already begun another uptrend following Bitcoin\u2019s rally to a new ATH. DOGE has again reclaimed the $ 0.20 psychological price level and could potentially reach its last local high at around $0.26. DOGE Against Its Bitcoin Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support with the monthly time frame indicators fully reset. The analyst indicated that this was possibly the best setup for Dogecoin, one that could spark a massive run for the meme coin. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline Meanwhile, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the Dogecoin-to-Bitcoin chart might show a God candle this month.

The analyst\u2019s accompanying chart showed that DOGE could rally to as high as $9 during this period. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $0.2 support level as being crucial for this lift-off for the meme coin.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-macd-signals-massive-rally-ahead-400-price-surge-possible/",
      "summary": "In line with a bullish trading week, Sui (SUI) prices soared by over 20% reaching a local peak of $3.54 before experiencing a slight retracement. The prominent altcoin, which is tipped to be a major player in a potential altseason, has maintained a remarkable price performance in the present market cycle rising by 352.04% in the last year alone. Based on technical indicators, renowned market analyst Ted Pillows postulates SUI may be gearing up for parabolic rally following recent market gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Through 50EMA After Rejection, ETH Dominance Sees Resurgence SUI Market Structure Signals Potential Breakout In an X post on July 11, Ted Pillows shares an insightful price analysis on the SUI market identifying a series of technical signals that precedes explosive market gains. These include a well-defined price movement within a well-defined ascending channel on the weekly timeframe, combined with an imminent bullish MACD crossover. In analyzing the ascending price channel, SUI has shown a strict adherence to both resistance and support zones. Notably, a healthy correction from its previous highs near $5.00 resulted in the altcoin finding support around $2.50 before initiating another rebound. As the altcoin presently consolidates, historical data indicates a potential return to the channel upper\u2019s boundary between $10.50 and $13.00. However, the major strength in Pillows\u2019 bullish thesis is the MACD setup that shows an impending bullish crossover i.e. when the MACD line (white) crosses above the signal line (orange), often interpreted by traders as an early sign of trend reversal or strengthening bullish momentum. Historically, the last time a decisive bullish MACD cross occurred on the weekly chart, it induced a six-month rally that delivered over 400% in gains. Going by this precedent, SUI bulls may be eying a potential price target of $13.76 by end of 2025. Related Reading: SUI Explodes Higher, Climbing Above 20-Day MA \u2014 But Can The Rally Hold? SUI Market Overview At the time of writing, SUI trades at $3.42 reflecting a 1.16% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the market trading volume is up by 17.68% and valued at $1.95 billion. On a monthly scale, SUI has recorded a marginal loss of 0.11%, suggesting that bearish forces still maintain a subtle grip on the market. Nevertheless, data from CoinMarketCap shows the Sui community remains bullish on the altcoin\u2019s future. Contributors to this market optimism includes the potential of SUI spot ETF following applications by prominent asset managers such as Grayscale, Canary Capital and 21 Shares. Meanwhile, the potential of an altseason remains valid amidst continuous speculations by market analysts. As earlier stated, SUI&#8217;s strong price history and growing recognition places the cryptocurrency as a major frontrunner in any altcoin market run.
