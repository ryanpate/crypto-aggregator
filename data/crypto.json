      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-must-hold-level-or-risk-30-price-crash/",
      "summary": "An analyst has explained how Dogecoin might have to hold strong above this level, if the memecoin has to avoid a 30% price drop. Dogecoin Is Currently Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart that shows where Dogecoin currently stands from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the graph in question, showing the trend in the 1-day price of the memecoin. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the Dogecoin price has possibly been trading inside a triangular channel during the last few months. The channel hasn&#8217;t appeared to be just any triangle-shaped one, either, but a special type called the Symmetrical Triangle. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls A Symmetrical Triangle forms whenever an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern tracks lower highs in the price, and the lower one higher lows. As the asset moves inside this channel, its range becomes narrower with time, until it shrinks down to a point at the apex. Generally, volatile moves are more likely to occur when consolidation tightens, so a breakout of the pattern becomes increasingly probable as the price approaches the tip of the triangle Symmetrical Triangle breakouts can signal a continuation of the trend in the direction of the break. This means that a rise above the pattern can be a bullish sign, while a drop below it may be a bearish one. As displayed in the chart, the 1-day price of Dogecoin has recently been nearing the end of the triangle, a potential sign that a breakout could be imminent. Currently, the memecoin is retesting the lower line, so it will be interesting to see whether the level holds or if this is where a break would finally happen. Unlike the Ascending and Descending Triangles, two other popular types of triangular channels in TA, breakouts are usually considered to be equally probable in either direction for a Symmetrical Triangle. The reason is simple: consolidation occurs in an exactly sideways manner in this pattern. In contrast, the Ascending and Descending types slope upward and downward, respectively, which can bias the breakout direction. Thus, even if Dogecoin is retesting the lower level right now, a rebound and then breakout from the upper line may also still be quite possible. That said, in the event that a bearish breakout does take place, things can be especially troubling for DOGE, as there is another level of importance just nearby.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-whale-and-retail-inflows-to-binance-fall-to-cycle-lows-more-upside-ahead/",
      "summary": "As Bitcoin (BTC) reels amidst escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran &#8211; dropping from $110,530 on June 9 to just above $106,900 today &#8211; concerns are mounting that BTC\u2019s upward momentum may have stalled. However, on-chain data suggests that both Bitcoin whales and retail investors still anticipate further upside for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whale And Retail Inflows To Binance Tumble According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin inflows to Binance crypto exchange from two distinct cohorts &#8211; whales and retail investors &#8211; have fallen to their lowest levels in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum \u2018Highly Likely\u2019 To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows Darkfost shared the following chart illustrating that Bitcoin whale inflows to Binance have hit their lowest point since 2024. Similarly, retail investor inflows are also at their lowest since 2024, signalling a strong preference to hold rather than sell. The contributor emphasized that this alignment in behavior between whales and retail investors is a \u201chighly constructive signal for the market.\u201d Apart from the consistent inflows observed at the start of the current cycle, Darkfost identified two previous instances when both groups acted in sync. Notably, such periods of aligned behavior have typically coincided with previous market tops. These tops were marked by synchronized BTC inflows into exchanges, leading to a significant uptick in selling pressure and, eventually, market demand exhaustion. Commenting on the recent drop in BTC inflows, Darkfost suggested that market participants may be waiting for clearer macroeconomic cues or are simply exhibiting high conviction in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential. They added: Such alignment across investor classes may also reflect broader market confidence, with expectations of further profits ahead. Recent trading setups support the aforementioned outlook. In a separate X post, seasoned crypto analyst Ash Crypto highlighted that a Bitcoin whale had opened a massive $200 million long position with 20x leverage. Should BTC Holders Be Worried? Despite the encouraging dip in BTC inflows to major exchanges like Binance, some analysts warn that a deeper correction may be imminent. For example, TradingView analyst MIRZA recently predicted that BTC could fall as low as $85,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance \u2013 A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Similarly, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a cautionary note, that BTC may see a steep slide in the coming months. Brandt stated that if BTC mirrors the 2021-22 market cycle, then it may risk falling to as low as $23,600. That said, BTC outflows from exchanges continue to rise, depleting available reserves &#8211; a dynamic that could result in a supply shock. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $106,920, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-with-4-of-swifts-volume/",
      "summary": "A recent analysis by a crypto market expert has reignited interest in XRP\u2019s potential utility, especially in the context of Ripple capturing a portion of SWIFT\u2019s global transaction volume. According to the expert, if Ripple secures just 14% of SWIFT\u2019s market share, the implications for XRP\u2019s supply and potential could be significant. XRP\u2019s Potential If Ripple Takes On 14% Of SWIFT Market expert Crypto Eri has emphasized, through detailed mathematical calculations, the impact Ripple, capturing 14% of SWIFT\u2019s total annual cross-border volume, could have on XRP\u2019s supply and daily transactions. Notably, the market expert emphasized that if Ripple were to process such a percentage, which is roughly $4.2 trillion, it would require a surprisingly small portion of XRP\u2019s total supply to support the transaction. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance According to Crypto Eri\u2019s calculations, the $4.2 trillion annual volume translates to approximately $11.5 billion in daily transaction value. To assess how much the altcoin would be needed to facilitate this, the analyst assumed a deliberately conservative scenario, with each token being used once every three minutes. This is significantly slower than XRP\u2019s actual settlement capability of 3 to 5 seconds but was chosen to reflect the potential liquidity management constraints in real-world applications. With 86,400 seconds in a day and each transaction occupying about 80 seconds, each XRP could be used for up to 480 transactions daily. Moreover, at the current market price of $2.15, Crypto Eri calculated that one XRP could facilitate $1,032 worth of transactions per day. To process the estimated $11.5 billion in daily volume, this would need approximately 11.15 million XRP tokens. This figure is striking when compared to XRP\u2019s circulating supply, which currently stands at around 58.82 billion tokens. Crypto Eri stated that just 0.0190% of this supply would be necessary to handle the calculated transaction volume, reinforcing the idea that XRP\u2019s high velocity and reusability make it a possible efficient bridge asset. Overall, Crypto Eri\u2019s Ripple-SWIFT analysis model presents a compelling case for XRP\u2019s utility in the global payments space. Her calculations and projections have also sparked widespread engagement across the crypto community, with several independent researchers and members concurring with her assessment and contributing their data-driven models to validate the projections further. The Token Burn Rate Estimates For Trillion-Dollar Use Case As XRP\u2019s potential utility in global finance is brought into focus by Crypto Eri, the market expert also offers new insight into XRP\u2019s burn rate in terms of fees needed to facilitate a $5 trillion annual transaction volume. A crypto community member followed up on the analyst\u2019s earlier Ripple and SWIFT calculations by asking how many of the token would be conservatively burned through transaction fees. Related Reading: Liquidity Levels Show XRP Price Is Headed Up, But Must Cross $2.40 First The analyst estimated that only 5,000 XRP would be permanently burned in the process\u2014an astonishingly small figure considering the massive scale of value being transferred. The estimate assumes an average transaction size of $10,000, which would result in roughly 500 million transactions per year to reach the $5 trillion mark.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-consolidation-continues-altseason-may-follow-a-clean-break-above-resistance/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has remained in a volatile consolidation phase, trading between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels as geopolitical tensions weigh heavily on global markets. After last week\u2019s failed breakout above resistance, ETH has retraced yet again, struggling to build sustained momentum. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified market uncertainty, contributing to spikes in volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation \u2013 Details Despite the macro headwinds, Ethereum bulls continue to defend key support levels, preventing a deeper breakdown. The $2,400 zone has acted as a strong floor in recent weeks, absorbing sell pressure and keeping ETH within its current trading range. Meanwhile, the $2,800 resistance remains the major hurdle to reclaim for a bullish breakout scenario. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum is still consolidating below a key resistance area. This structure indicates that ETH is coiling before its next major move. The window for a potential breakout narrows as price tightens within this established range. Ethereum Prepares To Move Ethereum has pushed into a critical price zone, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,600\u2013$2,700 range after recent volatility. The asset has shown resilience, rebounding from last week\u2019s lows and re-entering the mid-range of its multi-week consolidation. With price action once again approaching the $2,800 resistance level, market participants are eyeing a potential breakout that could open the door to $3,000 and beyond. Analysts remain divided. On one side, bullish momentum and improving market sentiment suggest ETH is preparing for a larger move. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger aggressive buying and initiate a broader altcoin rally. Many investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of a rotation from Bitcoin into high-beta assets like Ethereum, hoping to ride the next phase of the cycle. On the other side, caution persists. Some technical analysts argue that Ethereum may still be at risk of losing steam, especially if the price gets rejected again at resistance. A failure to maintain the current range could result in a retracement toward $2,400 support or even lower, shaking out weak hands. According to a recent technical update from Jelle, Ethereum remains locked in consolidation just below its key resistance zone. The analysis points to a tightening structure where the window of opportunity is closing. If ETH breaks above this zone, it could ignite fireworks across the altcoin market. With global uncertainty still present and traders closely watching resistance levels, Ethereum\u2019s next move could define the pace of the broader market. Whether it\u2019s a breakout or a breakdown, the coming days are likely to be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support \u2013 Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Action: Technical Details Ethereum is currently trading at $2,606, maintaining a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 as shown in the 12-hour chart. After multiple rejections around the $2,800 zone, the asset is struggling to break through this resistance level decisively. Despite the volatility triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty and Middle East conflict, ETH has managed to defend the $2,500 area, supported by a rising 100-period moving average. The recent bounce from the lower end of the range suggests that bulls are still active, stepping in to defend critical structure. However, volume remains relatively muted, indicating that buyers are cautious and awaiting confirmation before initiating larger positions. Meanwhile, the 50-period moving average remains above the 200-period MA, hinting at a medium-term bullish bias if support continues to hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds $2,500 Support \u2013 History Signals $4,000 As Potential Target The yellow horizontal zone marks the key resistance Ethereum must clear to trigger a sustained move higher, with a clean break above $2,800 likely igniting upside momentum toward $3,000. If the range breaks to the downside, the $2,400 zone is the next level to watch for demand. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
