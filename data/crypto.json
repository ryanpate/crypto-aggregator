      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-staking-hits-35m-eth-is-a-major-price-explosion-on-the-horizon/",
      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a notable pullback after a brief period of upward momentum earlier this month. The asset, which surged past the $2,800 level in mid-June, has since declined by 8.7% over the past week, now trading at around $2,498. This retreat follows broader market consolidation, as Ethereum struggles to maintain upward pressure despite strong on-chain activity. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues \u2013 Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Ethereum Staking and Accumulation Trends While ETH&#8217;s price action has turned negative, on-chain indicators suggest a contrasting narrative of growing investor conviction. According to insights shared by on-chain analyst OnChainSchool via CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, Ethereum has set a new record in staking activity. In the first half of June alone, more than 500,000 ETH were staked, pushing the total locked amount to over 35 million ETH. This growth in staked ETH not only reflects rising validator participation but also contributes to reducing the circulating supply, a dynamic that may influence future price movements. The report also highlights a rise in accumulation addresses, wallets that have received ETH but have never transferred any out. These addresses now collectively hold 22.8 million ETH, another all-time high. This trend is often interpreted as a sign of long-term holding behavior and suggests that certain investor cohorts are positioning themselves for future price appreciation rather than short-term gains. Taken together, the record levels of staking and accumulation point toward an increasingly illiquid supply, which, if demand increases, could amplify upward price pressure. Ethereum Hits ATH in Staking: Over 35 Million ETH Locked \u201cAlongside this, Accumulation Addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH.\u201d \u2013 By @onchainschool Read more \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/WYoX9qpODZ pic.twitter.com/6MAlK0sCfJ \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 17, 2025 A Technical Look: Price Explosion on the Horizon? In addition to the on-chain data, market participants are also analyzing Ethereum from a technical perspective. A crypto analyst on X operating under the pseudonym \u201cBitcoinsensus\u201d has drawn attention to a multi-year \u201cbullish flag\u201d pattern forming on ETH charts since 2021. A bullish flag is a technical chart formation that typically follows a strong price move upward, marked by a period of consolidation in a downward-sloping channel. If the asset breaks out of the flag to the upside, it can signal a continuation of the prior bullish trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support \u2013 Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels Bitcoinsensus suggests that if the pattern completes, Ethereum could target a move toward the $8,000 range.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross has surged into a zone that has historically signaled overpriced conditions for the asset. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Crossed Above 2.2 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross of Bitcoin. The NVT Golden Cross is an indicator based on another metric known as the NVT Ratio. The NVT Ratio keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. The idea behind the indicator is that the ability to transact coins (as gauged by the transaction volume) could be considered as a reflection of the asset&#8217;s &#8216;fair value.&#8217; Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark &#38; Whale Wallets Set New All-Time High Thus, through the comparison of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s current value (that is, the market cap) with this fair value, the metric can tell us about whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. When the value of the metric is high, it means the market cap is high compared to the transaction volume. Such a trend could imply BTC may be becoming overheated. On the other hand, the indicator being low could suggest room for the coin to grow relative to its volume. Now, the NVT Golden Cross, the actual metric of relevance here, is a signaling indicator like the Bollinger bands for the NVT Ratio that aims to locate tops and bottoms in its value. The NVT Golden Cross does so by comparing the short-term trend (represented by the 10-day MA) with the long-term one (30-day MA). Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the metric over the last couple of years. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has recently registered a sharp uptick and entered into the region above the 2.2 mark (highlighted in red). This zone is where the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market cap has historically outpaced the transaction volume to a degree that a reversion to the mean has tended to occur. In other words, it&#8217;s where price corrections to the downside have taken place for the asset. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion\u2014Warning Sign For Bitcoin? Though, it&#8217;s visible from the chart that not every top in the NVT Golden Cross inside this territory coincides with a price top. And in many instances that it does, the decline in the asset isn&#8217;t to some major degree. So far since the signal has appeared, however, the asset has indeed been going down, a potential sign that the same reversion effect may be in play once more. It now remains to be seen whether downside will be limited, or if this will be one of those instances where the signal was followed by an extended drawdown.

      "summary": "Amid the tension in the Iran-Israel conflict, the cryptocurrency market experienced another daily pullback. Bitcoin (BTC), which had just recovered from Friday\u2019s drop, erased its recent gains and recorded a 4.5% dip to the $103,000 mark in the past 24 hours. However, some analysts believe that the flagship crypto is preparing for a big move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Big Move As Price Compresses Between Key Levels \u2013 $2,100 Or $4,000 Next? Bitcoin Could See Massive Move Soon On Monday, Bitcoin attempted to break its post-November range high but failed to hold the $108,000-$109,000 area as support for the fourth time in a month, falling back into its larger range. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that this resistance level remains a key area to watch, adding that \u201cwithout a clean break above, it&#8217;s not the time to get excited just yet.\u201d Nonetheless, the trader considers that the BTC is \u201csetting up for a large move\u201d as the cryptocurrency continues to hold its monthly range between $100,000 and $110,000. He asserted that this range will break &#8220;at some point in June,\u201d as well as the current weekly high and low, which have \u201ca very low probability of being held\u201d in the coming days. Daan added that a break from these levels is highly possible in the next 1-2 weeks, likely leading to a big move in the direction of the break. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted the crypto market\u2019s performance and investors\u2019 concerns amid the war-related headlines, noting that Bitcoin reacted in a similar pattern during past geopolitical and crypto-related events. According to the analyst, global events\u2019 uncertainty has led to mass liquidation and on-chain panic multiple times since 2020, leading to 30%-50% crashes. However, the market has recovered from these events after significant accumulation. Here\u2019s the pattern: Big event (Black Swan). Panic headlines. Sharp BTC dump. Retail Panic sells. Smart money buys. Time passes. Bitcoin hits new highs. Based on this, Sjuul forecasted a strong Bitcoin pump and a new all-time high (ATH) once the current war tensions are over. BTC Holds Key Support Amid Pullback Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin has been retesting its old range high as support for the past six weeks and showing stability around the $104,400 level during this period. According to the analyst, as long as BTC\u2019s price Weekly Closes above this level, the candle wicks below it are \u201cjust noise\u201d and it is positioned to transition into its Second Price Discovery Uptrend. He also pointed out that the cryptocurrency has only seen a less than 10% dip during the recent pullbacks. Moreover, these drop depths have also been diminishing, with the first rejection producing a 7.72% drop and the second dip being 5.79% deep, while the current rejection has seen a 4.5% retrace so far. Rekt Capital considers the strongest support to be between the $102,000-$104,000 area, and the final level to break is the range high resistance of $108,890. Related Reading: XRP Must Complete Right Shoulder Before Takeoff\u2014But How Low First? &#8220;As long as this resistance isn&#8217;t rejecting price too much, then maybe it&#8217;s getting weaker over time,\u201d he affirmed, concluding that a weekly close above this level would be \u201ca very strong sign for a reclaim of this resistance into new support to springboard price higher.\u201d As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,085, a 1.1% jump in the past hour.
