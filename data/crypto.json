      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-repeat-of-2021/",
      "summary": "Ethereum saw a notable decline in its price over the last week, and the weekend culmination pulled the price back towards levels not seen in over one month. The movement tracks with the established bearish trend of the month of June and continues to show mounting sell pressure on the cryptocurrency. However, with this decline has emerged a trend similar to what was seen back in 2021, right before the market picked up and saw the beginning of the altcoin season. Ethereum Price Crash Similar To 2021 Looking at the current Ethereum price action and that of what was seen back in Q2 2021, there have been some striking similarities. Most especially, how the Ethereum price has performed in the month of June so far has been the same as what happened back in June 2021. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens In 2021, the Ethereum price began the month of June trading above $2,600. However, as the month went on, the altcoin suffered multiple declines and crashed below $2,000 before it was over. Eventually, the price would find its bottom somewhere around $1,600 before the decline was over. Fast forward four years to the year 2025, and the month of June is showing the same trend. June 2025 had begun with the Ethereum price trending above $2,600 before the bears took control. Since then, the altcoin has crashed by more than 20%, and looks primed for more. Using the historical performance, it would suggest that the Ethereum price decline is far from over. If there is a repeat of June 2021, then Ethereum could suffer another 20% crash before the month of June is over, to find its bottom somewhere between $1,600 and $1,700. The Trigger For Altcoin Season Given that Ethereum is the largest altcoin in the market, it is naturally the trigger for the altcoin season. Looking back on 2021, the altcoin season began when the Ethereum price began to rally. But the recovery did not begin until the month of July, and eventually lasted into the month of November. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications So far, investors are already looking positively toward July 2025, as there have been rumors of a rate cut. This is expected to trigger a market rally for risk assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the fact that a resolution to the Iran-Israel war could be in the works. If this trend holds, then it is possible that the Ethereum price would begin to rally in July. As seen in 2021, Ethereum would end up rising over 200% in the course of five months, to put in a new all-time high in the month of November. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-zone-markets-next-true-pivot-glassnode/",
      "summary": "The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted the $97,000 to $98,000 zone as an important one for Bitcoin. Here&#8217;s why. Bitcoin CBD Suggests Build Up Of Supply In This Range In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about a potentially significant zone for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) is an indicator that measures the amount of the BTC supply that investors last purchased or transferred at the various price levels. As is visible in the above graph, there is a dense supply zone located between $97,000 to $98,000. Generally, investors are quite sensitive to retests of their cost basis, so a large amount of them (or alternatively, a few large holders) having their acquisition level inside a narrow range could make retests of it significant for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss When the mood in the market is bullish, holders can react to retests of their cost basis from above by buying more. They may do so believing that the same level would end up proving profitable again in the future and the retrace is just a &#8216;dip.&#8217; The cryptocurrency suffered a plunge yesterday and nearly touched this region. Since then, however, things have turned around for the asset and it has gained some distance over it once more. In the event that the decline does continue, which may not be too unexpected given the volatile geopolitical situation at the moment, the zone could end up acting as the next true pivot for Bitcoin, according to the analytics firm. While the CBD tells us where the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply is concentrated, it doesn&#8217;t contain any information about who bought or sold at those price levels. Glassnode&#8217;s behavioral cohorts, investor groups divided on the basis of their behavior, solve this problem. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by these holder cohorts over the past few years: There are five of these behavior groups. First Buyers (green) include the investors who are buying Bitcoin for the very first time. As displayed in the chart, the supply of this group has been on the rise, indicating fresh demand has been coming in. Momentum Buyers (blue) are those that capitalize on market momentum by buying during uptrends. On the opposite spectrum are the Conviction Buyers (purple), who buy despite falling prices. Finally, there are the Loss Sellers (red) and Profit Takers (yellow), who correspond to investors exiting at a loss and profit, respectively. During the past couple of weeks, the former cohort has seen an increase of 29%, a sign that weak hands have been capitulating. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy That said, the analytics firm has noted, &#8220;Conviction Buyers also increased, suggesting sentiment isn\u2019t collapsing. Some are cutting losses &#8211; others are actively lowering their cost basis.&#8221; BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,900, down more than 4% in the last seven days.

There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $632 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Gains After forming a base above the $600 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $620 and $625 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $651 swing high to the $602 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $632 and the 100-hourly simple moving average.

The next resistance sits near the $650 level. A clear move above the $650 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $665. A close above the $665 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $644 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $635 level. The next major support is near the $632 level. The main support sits at $625. If there is a downside break below the $625 support, the price could drop toward the $612 support.

      "summary": "Cardano (ADA) has been struggling to hold some crucial levels over the month, falling to multi-month lows over the weekend. As the cryptocurrency attempts to hold a key support area, some analysts believe this make-or-break retest will determine its next big move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wobbles? Metaplanet Buys Big, Breaks $1 Billion Mark Cardano To See More Bleeding Cardano is recording a 4.5% daily increase after bouncing from the $0.51 area on Sunday. Notably, ADA was in a downtrend following its 3-year high of $1.32 in December 2024, which ended after the late April breakout and May bullish rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold its April-May range amid the June market pullback, losing the key $0.66 area ten days ago. Since then, Cardano has recorded seven consecutive red daily candles and fallen below the $0.60 support. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that Cardano\u2019s rally will be halted unless some ground is recovered. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency\u2019s multi-month price action \u201cended up being a classic distribution schematic\u201d after losing the $0.66 support. This would signal that ADA\u2019s uptrend has ended and a potential downtrend is ahead. \u201cAs long as we don&#8217;t reclaim $0.66, just expect further downtrend from now on,\u201d he asserted. Meanwhile, market watcher Man of Bitcoin highlighted the cryptocurrency\u2019s June downtrend, affirming that if the price remains below the descending trendline, downward pressure will persist. He added that \u201cOne more low in wave iv is still possible,\u201d hinting that a drop below the $0.50 could be on the horizon before the next wave up. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that \u201cit should be a brief wick to the downside\u201d as a \u201csustained break lower would weaken the bullish outlook.\u201d ADA Retest To Trigger Rally To $1? Amid the ongoing global war tensions, ADA\u2019s price retested the crucial $0.52 support on Sunday, hitting a four-month low of $0.51, before recovering and closing the week around the $0.54 mark. Market watcher Rose Premium Signals noted that a weekly close around the crucial $0.56 level would continue the possible double-bottom setup forming on ADA\u2019s chart. The analyst added that a confirmed rebound from the $0.54-$0-56 area could send the price to the initial $0.99 target and set the stage for a climb toward the $1.20 and $1.50 resistances. On the contrary, failing to hold this area could see Cardano lose its six-month price range and retrace to the $0.32 level. Meanwhile, Crypto Billion affirmed that Cardano appears to be forming a potential triple bottom structure, which could lead to a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support \u2013 $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move As the cryptocurrency retested the $0.50-$0.52 area over the weekend, the analyst highlighted that this key range had been held twice before since the November breakout. Additionally, he pointed out that ADA\u2019s price appears to be trading within a multi-month falling wedge pattern, which suggests a breakout toward the $1 mark if the price climbs toward the upper boundary. As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.54, a 15.6% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"
