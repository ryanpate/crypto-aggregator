Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful? VC Firm Says XRP Could Reach Nearly $9,000 In Just 5 Years Vice President J.D. Vance provided the tie\u2011breaking vote that sealed the deal for the $4.5 trillion package. The package contains major tax reductions, deeper border security funding, and substantial cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP. No crypto\u2011specific language was included, but lawmakers attempted to insert a tax benefit for digital currencies during last minute wrangling. Bitcoin Dips Before Quick Rebound Based on reports from crypto exchanges, Bitcoin slid to about $106,344 just before the vote as traders held off on big bets. Once the Senate approved the bill, BTC jumped back above $107,800. That\u2019s a swing of roughly $1,400 in a single session, or about 1.3%. Some traders said they sold into the dip and bought back in once the outcome was clear. Others just shook their heads and waited for the next news headline. Altcoins And Liquidations Take A Hit Ethereum barely moved, dipping 0.3%, while XRP fell about 0.7% on the day. Solana saw the biggest wobble, dropping as much as 6% during trading. In total, more than $219 million in liquidations hit the broader crypto market. Bitcoin alone accounted for roughly $60 million of that, as leveraged positions got squeezed when prices spiked back up. Crypto Stocks See Gains Stocks tied to digital assets also rallied on the bill\u2019s passage. MicroStrategy (now Strategy) shares climbed around 3.2%, and Coinbase jumped 2.3% in early trading on Tuesday. Those moves outpaced the Nasdaq\u2019s modest gains.

The traders will be watching closely for the next inflation reading and for any signals from the Federal Reserve. If a rise in prices drives the Fed to more increases, crypto markets may come under new strain. However, others view the Senate vote as another reminder that Bitcoin and its cousins can move on significant political news\u2014sometimes in ways not necessarily expected.

      "title": "Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-2-year-sideways-movement/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) is now 195 days into its latest sideways movement, which is part of a broader two-year stretch marked by sluggish price action and short-lived rallies. According to a crypto analyst, just 36 days of meaningful gains have defined this cycle, while the rest have been a relentless grind. Still, despite the clear market fatigue and repeated new lows, the analyst insists that the cycle isn\u2019t over yet. Bitcoin Cycle Sees Only 36 Days Of Real Gains The current Bitcoin market cycle is being closely examined, as a new analysis by expert analyst Crypto Con delves deep into the cryptocurrency\u2019s past movements, revealing two full years of sideways price action with only brief periods of upward momentum. The analyst\u2019s chart, titled \u201cCycle 4 Ranges and Expansions,\u201d highlights a pattern of prolonged range-bound activity interrupted by short bursts of expansion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move As of now, Crypto Con notes that Bitcoin has been consolidating for 195 consecutive days since December 18, 2024, without setting a new local high. The chart analysis shows that the total time spent in actual upward expansion in the entire cycle is just 5.76 months. Even more interesting is the fact that when isolating the days in which Bitcoin recorded new local highs, the number shrinks to just 36 days. According to the market expert, these expansion bursts are responsible for all of Bitcoin&#8217;s significant price increases during its current cycle. Every expansion phase has also occurred within extremely narrow windows\u2014typically just two to five days long. The rest of the cycle after this has been characterized by a consistent sluggish grind and long stretches of price consolidation, where momentum fades and the market struggles to advance. Flattened Price Action Hides Cycles\u2019 Underlying Strength A closer look at the bottom section of Crypto Con\u2019s chart, which removes the expansion bursts, shows how Bitcoin\u2019s price has essentially remained flat or trended lower throughout the cycle. Major sideways phases in 2023 and 2024 lasted 192 days and 238 days, respectively, offering minimum sustained upside. The current 2025 range has now extended close to 200 days, continuing the trend of market inactivity. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Despite the drawn-out stagnation, Crypto Con maintains that this cycle is not over yet. He implies that Bitcoin\u2019s prolonged accumulation and consolidation could be building pressure for a significant breakout. The chart also shows Bitcoin\u2019s next potential upside target between $165,000 and $180,000. Currently the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $106,990, meaning a jump anywhere between these targets would represent price increase of over 54%. If previous patterns hold, BTC\u2019s next major move may arrive swiftly, as past expansions have delivered their impact in just a few trading sessions. Until that moment arrives, Bitcoin remains locked in what is shaping up to be the slowest and possibly the most patient-testing cycle to date. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-consolidates-below-resistance/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is at a pivotal point, and the weekly close could define its next move. To confirm bullish continuation and strengthen market confidence, BTC needs to secure a solid weekly close above $107,720. Bitcoin Weekly Candle Could Set The Stage For A Run Bitcoin is approaching a make-or-break moment, but if BTC can secure a strong weekly close above $107,720, it could trigger a move toward the $130,000 to $135,000 range in Q3. This key level is acting as a resistance zone, and breaking it could unlock a new wave of bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near SatheMeme_Expert revealed on X that a similar setup had appeared in Q4 2024, when BTC posted its biggest weekly close of the year. The result was an unstoppable rally that shattered resistance and fueled one of the strongest bullish legs of the cycle. The weekly chart shows Bitcoin is trading within a well-defined historical parallel channel. As mentioned by Pinnacle_Crypto, this channel has previously marked a breakout point in October 2023 and October 2024, which fueled upward moves. If this pattern continues, BTC could be on track to reach the $150,916 target in October 2025. The channel provides a roadmap, with key breakouts that signal the start of rallies. Alongside, price dips will serve as accumulation zones. Crypto analyst Gemxbt also highlighted that Bitcoin&#8217;s 1-hour chart is currently in a downward trend, but the price is attempting to bounce off a support zone near $106.500. So far, this area is holding firm, providing a foundation for buyers to step in, and technical indicators support this potential shift. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recovering from oversold levels, hinting that selling momentum is waning, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is nearing a bullish crossover, which could signal the start of upward momentum. However, for a meaningful reversal to hold, BTC must overcome the critical resistance near $108,500. A breakout above with sustained volume will be crucial to confirm the trend and bullish momentum. Consolidation Phase Matures \u2014 Breakout May Be Imminent BTC is consolidating inside a descending channel formation on the daily chart, a pattern that typically reflects a phase with a broader trend. Dynamite Trader emphasized that BTC is currently trading above the 50-day moving average (MA 50), a technical level that is now solid for the bulls. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Just Realized $2.6B In Profit, Is the Market About to Crack or Soar? A breakout above the descending channel would mark a shift in sentiment and momentum, potentially triggering a bullish continuation toward the $120,000 region, the next psychosocial target on the macro chart. According to MiraCrypto, Bitcoin has shown a strong breakout from the descending channel on the 1-day chart, signaling a shift in momentum. BTC is now consolidating above the resistance, which has turned into support. This consolidation above the breakout levels is a bullish continuation signal seen before the next leg higher. MiraCrypto noted that as long as BTC holds this zone, the path remains open for a move toward $135,000. featured Image from Istock images, chart from tradingveiw.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-defi-activity-expands-sunswap-hits-3b-monthly-swaps-in-2025/",
      "summary": "Tron (TRX) is currently navigating a prolonged consolidation phase that began in December 2024, with prices oscillating between key levels and no clear breakout direction in sight. Despite this range-bound action, Tron remains firmly in the spotlight as fundamental developments capture market attention. The most significant news came two weeks ago, when reports revealed that Tron is preparing to go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment. This potential listing could mark a major milestone for the blockchain platform, potentially making it the first major crypto network to enter US public markets directly. Related Reading: Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High At the same time, on-chain data signals growing momentum beneath the surface. According to insights from CryptoQuant, DeFi activity on the Tron network has been steadily expanding. Rising transaction volumes, increasing deposits in JustLend, and record swap activity on SunSwap point to deepening liquidity and user engagement. These developments highlight a maturing ecosystem, but the market has yet to price in a breakout move. As consolidation continues, traders and investors are closely watching for the next major catalyst. Whether Tron\u2019s public listing or accelerating DeFi traction triggers it remains to be seen, but momentum is quietly building. Tron DeFi Growth Signals Underlying Strength Tron is testing critical price levels after months of sideways movement, consolidating between $0.211 and $0.295. This range has acted as a structural base since late 2024, and a clean break in either direction could determine Tron\u2019s next major trend. A breakout above $0.295 would likely trigger fresh momentum toward new local highs, while failure to hold support could expose the asset to deeper corrections. While the broader crypto market anticipates upward expansion\u2014supported by the rally in US equities and a more stable macro backdrop\u2014Tron remains trapped in this tight band. Volatility persists, and without a decisive breakout, market participants remain cautious. Still, underlying fundamentals suggest TRX may be quietly gathering strength. According to CryptoQuant data, DeFi activity on the Tron network is rising rapidly. SunSwap has surpassed $3 billion in monthly swap volume consistently throughout 2025, with May setting a record at $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, JustLend deposits have more than tripled year-to-date, peaking at $740 million. These developments point to deepening liquidity and growing demand across Tron\u2019s DeFi ecosystem. Stablecoin inflows and increasing borrowing activity further reinforce Tron\u2019s expanding utility, suggesting the network is becoming a robust settlement layer. While the price remains range-bound for now, the fundamentals hint at a strong foundation for future upside, once the technical breakout finally materializes. Related Reading: Tron Shows Adoption Strength As Volume Still Led By Big Transfers \u2013 Details TRX Price Consolidates Near Resistance TRX is currently trading around $0.2813, maintaining its position near the upper boundary of the long-standing consolidation range that began in December 2024. The asset has shown resilience above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all of which are trending upward, supporting the bullish outlook. The 50-day SMA at $0.2508 and the 100-day SMA at $0.2289 are providing dynamic support, indicating strong buyer interest on dips. Price action throughout June remained sideways, with low volatility and volume consistent with a classic consolidation phase. Despite multiple rejections below the $0.295 resistance, TRX has not shown any signs of structural weakness, holding firmly above $0.26\u2013$0.27 and gradually building pressure toward a breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near Volume has remained stable, though not yet signaling the kind of breakout momentum that would confirm a move into higher price discovery. Traders are watching closely for a clean candle close above $0.295 to validate a bullish continuation. If successful, TRX could rally toward the $0.32\u2013$0.35 zone, with minimal overhead resistance. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-as-high-as-20-30/",
      "summary": "An AI startup founder and vocal XRP supporter on the social media platform X has offered his long-awaited price prediction for the cryptocurrency. XRP&#8217;s price action in recent days has been highlighted by a quick surge to $2.30 on June 30, in what looks like the bulls trying to close the month of June above $2.20. That momentum, however, was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency has slipped back below this level in the most recent two days. Although momentum has not yet returned in full, bullish predictions are still active, and this latest prediction adds another confident voice to the growing chorus of those expecting a significant breakout. XRP Price As High As $20 To $30 Taking to the social media platform, Vincent Van Code, an AI startup founder, offered his personal price outlook for XRP. He explained that while he rarely comments on specific targets, he believes the asset has the potential to reach between $30 and $50. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 However, it is important to note that this reasoning is not rooted in technical analysis, but rather in belief and long-term conviction based on XRP&#8217;s current price trajectory. Furthermore, he noted that his investment in XRP is shaped by this personal view of a $20 to $30 price target and admitted he cannot predict the timing of such a rally. The details of how the journey plays out to this price target are far less important than the eventual outcome. It is clear that the ultra-bullish price prediction is not intended to persuade or convince others. However, it shows the confidence some traders have in XRP&#8217;s future price. It also resonates with many predictions from other crypto participants regarding XRP, both in terms of technical and fundamental analysis. Familiar Price Predictions Within The Altcoin&#8217;s Circle This prediction aligns with a broader sense of optimism often found among XRP supporters. Although some critics continue to argue that price targets of $30 or more are unrealistic, especially due to its huge circulating supply, many in the XRP community continue to see such price targets as attainable. Related Reading: Deaton Says Ripple IPO Could Trigger $100B Valuation, How High Will The XRP Price Be? The beliefs of extravagant XRP price targets are often based on its fundamentals, mostly on expectations of widespread adoption in cross-border payments and institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. In fact, one analyst pointed to this as the reason why the XRP price will surge above $1,000, stabilize at this level, and eventually become very expensive. Technical analysis from crypto analyst JackTheRippler pointed to an incoming price target above $30 for XRP. In a similar vein, a recent technical analysis by popular crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO shows that the altcoin is on track to climb above $9.5 and reach as high as $37.5. XRP rallied to as high as $2.30 on June 30, and then reversed to an intraday low of $2.15 in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19.
