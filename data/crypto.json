      "summary": "Although Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) momentum has stalled over the past week due to escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the flagship cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern on the three-day chart &#8211; significantly increasing the likelihood of a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Bitcoin Eyeing New ATH Soon? In an X post published today, crypto analyst Mister Crypto highlighted that BTC is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the three-day chart. The analyst shared the following chart, noting that a successful breakout could propel Bitcoin\u2019s price as high as $150,000. For the uninitiated, the inverse head &#38; shoulders is a bullish chart pattern that signals a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It consists of three troughs, a lower low &#8211; called the &#8220;head&#8221; &#8211; between two higher lows &#8211; called the &#8220;shoulders.&#8221; This is followed by a breakout above the &#8220;neckline&#8221; resistance, indicating rising buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Despite ongoing uncertainty in the market, analysts remain largely optimistic. For example, noted analyst Jelle pointed out that BTC has formed a major bullish pennant above previous highs &#8211; another positive technical signal. BTC is also poised to benefit from shrinking supply on trading platforms. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto commentator Master of Crypto noted that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are about to fall below two million &#8211; the lowest level since 2017. Depleting BTC balances on exchanges suggest that investors are moving their Bitcoin to long-term storage, reducing the amount available for immediate sale. This supply constraint can create upward pressure on price, especially if demand continues to rise. Meanwhile, another Bitcoin analyst, apsk32, highlighted BTC\u2019s ongoing alignment with the power curve cycle. Remarkably, Bitcoin has followed this cycle consistently for 15 years, and if the trend holds, the next cycle top could occur in November or December 2025. BTC Quantity More Important Than Price In a separate X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki emphasized that the number of BTC one holds is more important than its current price. In a detailed thread, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Warning: Short-Term Holder Selling Accelerates Amid Price Correction While a $1 million price target may seem ambitious, other analysts also forecast new highs in the near term. For example, CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Aleman recently projected that BTC could top out at $205,000 by the end of 2025. In addition, exchange data suggests an impending supply crunch, as whales continue withdrawing large amounts of BTC while exchange inflows remain subdued.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-gears-60-move-will-it-be-up-or-down/",
      "summary": "An analyst has explained how Dogecoin could be primed for a 60% price move. Here&#8217;s the range that could end up deciding the direction of the break. Dogecoin Is Nearing The End Of A Triangle Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin is currently looking from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 1-day price of DOGE. As displayed in the graph, the daily Dogecoin price has been trading inside what appears to be a triangular channel. A triangle is a TA pattern that forms whenever an asset&#8217;s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 13%: Can Key On-Chain Support Stop The Fall? The upper line of the pattern is likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower one support. A break out of either of the lines can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. There are a few different types of triangles, with a few popular ones being the Symmetrical, Ascending, and Descending variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides the type of the triangle. In a Symmetrical Triangle, the lines converge at a roughly equal and opposite slope. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, both upward and downward volatility shrinks in an even manner. For the Ascending and Descending versions, however, there is a bias to the upside or downside. In the former, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis and the price progressively makes higher lows. Similarly, the latter involves lower highs with a flat support level. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the Triangle that Dogecoin has been moving inside for the past few months is similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it has a slight tilt toward the downside. It&#8217;s also visible that DOGE is nearing in on the end of the triangle. Generally, triangle breakouts become more likely to occur as the asset approaches the apex, as the consolidation range squeezes tight in this region. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend\u2014But Can They Keep It Up? Considering that Dogecoin may be in this zone now, it&#8217;s possible that its spring may be ready to uncoil. Based on the pattern forming in the daily price, the analyst has noted that DOGE looks primed for a 60% move. As for which way a break would happen, that naturally comes down to which line the memecoin exits the triangle from. &#8221; All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend,&#8221; notes Martinez. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, down more than 11% over the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com"
