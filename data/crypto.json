      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-remains-bullish-above-2/",
      "summary": "The XRP price is holding strongly above $2, maintaining its momentum as technical indicators show signs of a bullish trend. Notably, a distinct Falling Channel on the XRP price chart suggests that a breakout could be brewing, with a potential rally toward $3.8 in sight. XRP Price Holds Steady As Bulls Target $3.8 A technical analysis by Rose Premium Signals reveals that XRP is currently flashing strong bullish signals following a breakout from a long-term Falling Channel. Earlier in January, XRP broke past $3 but experienced a strong correction that has kept its price down ever since. Despite the ongoing downtrend, XRP has been firmly holding above the $2 threshold as it prepares for new all-time highs. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? Previously, XRP traded within a descending range for several months, forming lower highs and lower lows. However, recent price action has seemingly invalidated this downtrend structure with a decisive breakout above the upper boundary of the Falling Channel, indicating a potential trend reversal and the beginning of a bullish continuation. The chart shared by Rose Premium Signals on X (formerly Twitter) shows that after the breakout, XRP has been consolidating above the former resistance-turned-support zone, around the $2 level. The analyst confidently states that XRP\u2019s outlook remains inherently bullish despite past downtrends, suggesting that the recent consolidation pattern indicates that bulls are still in control. Notably, the breakout above the Falling Channel is significant, as it typically implies a strong upside move, especially on higher time frames. Projected price targets based on technical formation are positioned at $2.9520, $3.3967, and $3.8767. Interestingly, the highest projected target exceeds XRP\u2019s all-time high of $3.84 and reflects a 73.54% increase from current price levels. It\u2019s important to note that these bullish targets forecasted by Rose Premium Signals align with historical resistance zones and measured moves from the Falling Channel breakout. If momentum sustains and market conditions remain favorable, XRP could rally toward these targets over the coming weeks, potentially offering significant upside for long-term holders and traders. Analyst Says Buy The Dip, With Ideal Entry At $1.85 While forecasting several optimistic targets for XRP, Rose Premium Signals emphasized a strategy of buying the altcoin during dips. This method aims to capitalize on low price points to maximize potential gains as XRP rebounds. Related Reading: Wave Count Analysis Reveals The XRP Price Trigger Point For Take-Off The analyst\u2018s chart highlights the $1.85 support level with a clear \u201cBuy Here\u201d label, suggesting that this level is considered an ideal entry point should the price revisit it. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.23, meaning a drop to $1.85 would represent a 17.04% decrease. According to the analysis, this support level also marks the base of the recent Falling Channel breakout, providing a favorable risk-reward setup for those looking to enter or expand their positions.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/coinbase-account-freezing-issue-best-wallet-alternative/",
      "summary": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has acknowledged that the unexpected freezing of user accounts has been a major issue for the cryptocurrency exchange. In a recent announcement on X, Armstrong stated that the company has successfully reduced these unnecessary account restrictions by 82% and is committed to further improvements. The progress comes after significant investment in upgrading the platform\u2019s machine learning models and infrastructure, according to Dor Levi, a product team member at Coinbase. The enhancements have improved the precision of the Coinbase security systems, leading to fewer legitimate accounts being mistakenly flagged and frozen. Despite these advancements, Armstrong and Levi confirmed that Coinbase will continue to comply with court orders and legal sanctions requiring account restrictions. The Custodial Dilemma: When Your Crypto Isn\u2019t Yours Despite the platform\u2019s efforts, the announcement has been met with continued frustration from many customers. Some users on social media reported being unable to access funds for months, and in some cases, over two years, leading many to abandon the platform. Compounding the issue are complaints made on X about the difficulty of reaching a human customer service representative to resolve matters. The situation is a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with custodial wallets, where a third party, like Coinbase, holds the user\u2019s private keys and thus has ultimate control over their funds. Given these challenges, the principle of \u2018not your keys, not your crypto\u2019 has never been more relevant. The only way to guarantee immunity from third-party freezes, breaches, or restrictions is by using a non-custodial wallet like Best Wallet, where you retain complete control of your private keys and digital assets. Best Wallet: Security You Control, Freedom You Deserve If you\u2019re looking to escape these custodial risks, Best Wallet offers a powerful solution built on the principle of true ownership.

      "summary": "Many crypto traders still manually wade through hundreds of token profiles, candlestick charts, and market cap pages each day.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-going-to-1-next-impulse/",
      "summary": "Maelius (@MaeliusCrypto) has published a fresh weekly chart of DOGE/USDT from Binance and\u2014despite the meme-coin\u2019s recent pull-back\u2014sees the groundwork for a textbook Elliott-wave extension that could catapult prices toward the psychological $1.00 mark. Can Dogecoin Hit $1? The chart tracks every weekly candle since early-2021 and puts the current market at $0.1843 after a four-week slide from the March high near $0.26. That decline has carried price straight back into a broad green \u201cdemand\u201d band that now stretches roughly from $0.12 up to $0.17. The zone once acted as heavy overhead resistance during 2022-23; Maelius notes that, after last year\u2019s breakout, it has switched polarity and is behaving as a base of demand. Two moving averages frame the structure. The 50-week exponential average (EMA 50, blue) is curling higher and sits at about $0.205, while the 200-week EMA (red) is printed at $0.1415. Price is currently wedged between the two, a configuration that often precedes a decisive expansion in volatility. Notably, a rising red trend-line\u2014drawn beneath successive higher lows since late-2023\u2014now coincides almost exactly with the 200-week EMA, reinforcing the $0.15 area as technical support. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive Maelius\u2019 count assigns the March 2024 spike to $0.23 as the primary wave 1, and the subsequent retreat to the October 2024 low near $0.12 as the primary wave 2. From that inflection point the analyst sees the opening stages of a third wave unfolding, but\u2014crucially\u2014he marks a smaller-degree wave 1 of that larger wave 1 peaking just above $0.48 in early December last year, followed by the present pull-back that he labels the smaller-degree wave 2. In other words, the chart shows a classic \u201c1-2, 1-2\u201d nesting: a big 1-2 at primary degree, immediately followed by a smaller 1-2 that kicks off the presumed third-of-third advance. Such a configuration is typically regarded by Elliott technicians as the most explosive setup in the entire impulse hierarchy because the next leg is the wave 3 of wave 3, a segment that can extend with the steepest slope and often delivers the bulk of a trend\u2019s price appreciation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst A dashed projection ray extrapolates that third wave to the $1.10 region, before wave 4 is pencilled in as a shallow retrace to roughly $0.65 and wave 5 completes somewhere in the $1.50\u2013$1.80 range. Maelius tempers the roadmap in his accompanying post, stating he is \u201cnot a fan of hard targets\u201d but believes \u201cthis one goes towards $1 in the next impulse.\u201d Under the price pane Maelius plots the weekly WaveTrend Oscillator (WTO). Both the fast (black) and slow (red) curves bottomed inside the highlighted oversold band in April and have since hooked sharply higher. That turn has been accompanied by a steady contraction in the crimson histogram bars; over the last two candles the histogram has in fact flipped back to light-grey on the positive side of the midline, signalling that bearish momentum is losing its grip and that a fresh bullish impulse may be brewing. DOGE is now hovering exactly at the upper rim of the demand box. A weekly close above the EMA 50 at $0.205 would signal renewed bullish dominance and open the way to $0.26\u2014the May swing high\u2014and the mid-$0.40s cluster that halted price during the December 2024 rally. Conversely, a decisive break under $0.14 would violate the two-year ascending trend-line and postpone the Elliott count. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.18.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/ignore-the-trump-musk-noise-bitcoins-backbone-stays-solid/",
      "summary": "A sudden slide in Bitcoin\u2019s dollar value rattled traders this week after US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk tangled in public comments. The drop was sharp, and it raised questions about whether BTC can keep its upward momentum. According to market data, prices dipped quickly before finding a floor, leaving some investors on edge while others looked to on-chain figures for clues. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Exchange Reserves Slip Based on reports from CryptoQuant, the amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges fell from 2,435,600 BTC to 2,365,400 BTC over seven days. That\u2019s a nearly 3% decline. When coins leave exchanges it often means people want to hold them in private wallets. Fewer coins available to sell can tighten supply. In turn, that may help prices recover. Realized Cap Hits New High According to the same data, Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Capitalization recently hit $935 billion. It\u2019s the highest level on record. Realized Cap tracks the value of all coins at the price when they last moved on-chain. A rising number shows fresh capital flowing into Bitcoin. It suggests both small traders and large institutions are still betting on BTC\u2019s long-term value. Netflow Shows Accumulation Based on the flow of deposits and withdrawals, Bitcoin\u2019s netflow has been negative. That means more coins have left exchanges than have been deposited. Withdrawals beat deposits in trading volume. In simple terms, holders aren\u2019t looking to sell right now. It\u2019s a classic sign that buyers outnumber sellers\u2014at least in the on-chain arena. UTXO Bands Point To Holder Confidence CryptoQuant\u2019s UTXO Value Bands also reveal growing activity across multiple coin-age groups. UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Outputs. It measures the age and value of coins that haven\u2019t moved. When you see more coins in older bands and steady movement in newer ones, it tells you a variety of investors\u2014from long-term holders to recent buyers\u2014are staying active. That pattern tends to shore up market support. Related Reading: Blank Pi Network Wallets Spark Outcry\u2014What\u2019s The Network Hiding? Looking Ahead Even if Bitcoin\u2019s price can swing wildly day to day, these on-chain signals hint at solid backing underneath. Less supply on exchanges, a record realized cap of $934.88 billion, ongoing negative netflow and rising UTXO activity all point toward patient investors holding their ground. Short-term dips may still occur, especially when big names trade barbs on social media. But for many in the market, the long-term story remains intact.
