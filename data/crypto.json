      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/south-korea-cbdc-delay-best-wallet-edge/",
      "summary": "South Korea pressed pause on its central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, even as its new government pivoted toward promoting domestic stablecoins. Telling banks involved that introducing won-denominated stablecoins would be \u2018desirable,\u2019 South Korea&#8217;s central bank has slowed down on any progress towards a CBDC. In the meantime, Hong Kong is rolling out a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance aimed at challenging U.S. dollar dominance and bolstering its own financial infrastructure. Both countries reinforce a common perception: crypto is here to stay, and you\u2019ll need a top-notch crypto wallet like Best Wallet app to keep on top of everything. South Korea: Cold Feet on CBDC, but Full Speed Ahead on Stablecoins In a surprise move, the Bank of Korea halted the second phase of its CBDC pilot, planned for later this year, for further review. The advanced pilot, involving peer-to-peer transfers and merchant payments, takes a back seat amid rising concern over cost, commercialization ambiguity, and regulatory readiness. This policy change is strongly influenced by President Lee Jae\u2011myung\u2019s administration, which won elections earlier in June based at least partly on crypto promises. The new administration also fostered a regulatory framework enabling firms with modest capital (\u20a9500 million ~ US$370K) to issue stablecoins under the Digital Asset Basic Act. At a time when over a third of South Korea\u2019s population \u2013 roughly 18M people \u2013 trade crypto, boosting stablecoins seems like a solid move. The decision to move away from a CBDC is a bit more surprising. Still, with so many investors trading crypto daily, there\u2019s a real desire to build and strengthen frameworks like the ones for stablecoins. Other countries are making similar moves, though perhaps for more political reasons. Hong Kong: Regulating Stablecoins to Reduce U.S. Dollar Dependence Hong Kong is set to enforce its Stablecoins Ordinance starting August 1, 2025. Passed on May 21, the law mandates HKMA licensing for any fiat-referenced stablecoin issuer targeting the city\u2019s residents. The rigorous licensing requirements cover reserve holdings, fund segregation, redemption rights, and anti-money-laundering protocols. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan ties the initiative to China\u2019s broader de\u2011dollarization strategy, highlighting stablecoins as pivotal for trade and cross-border payments in local currencies. In his words: \u2018Fintech has great potential in the application of cross-border trade, and the goal is to solve the long-standing pain points of slow and high cost of cross-border payment, and better serve the real economy in the field of payment\u2026 stablecoins are a cost-effective alternative to the traditional financial system and have the potential to revolutionize payments and capital market activities, including cross-border payments. The stablecoin legislation will\u2026 encourage issuers to extend the application of stablecoins to different scenarios, and help solve the real pain points of enterprises in business and people&#8217;s lives.\u2019 Hong Kong anticipates local issuers and regulated institutions taking the lead, with limited retail uptake initially, but significant promise for cross-border institutional use. And as retail interest grows, more and more investors are going to need a crypto wallet \u2013 the best kind of crypto wallet. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 Supercharge the Leading Web3 Wallet for the World Crypto Economy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) takes two key ingredients for crypto wallet utility and creates something even more powerful. The first element is a simple, powerful web3 wallet \u2013 Best Wallet app. With MPC and biometric security, the ability to set up multiple wallets, and a unique upcoming tokens hub to research and purchase hot crypto presales, Best Wallet app gives new and experienced crypto users everything they need to succeed in today\u2019s crypto economy. The $BEST token supercharges the entire ecosystem. Token holders gain: \u2705 Reduced transaction fees \u2705 Better staking returns \u2705 Exclusive project access \u2705 Governance rights The ongoing presale has raised $13.6M so far. $BEST tokens are on sale for $0.025255, but our price prediction shows they could reach $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, delivering 102% gains for presale participants.

What These Moves Signal Both governments seek to balance private stablecoin innovation with preserving monetary policy control. South Korea\u2019s pivot reflects a pragmatic approach: redirecting momentum from costly and uncertain CBDC deployment toward a more agile, regulated stablecoin model. Hong Kong\u2019s strategy signifies a calculated expansion of its role in the global digital asset economy, linking stablecoin issuance to monetary liberalization and regional trade objectives, and supporting China\u2019s broader political goals. In each case, the success of stablecoin ambitions hinges on the dirty details of regulation, institutional participation, and financial market dynamics. And success means that everyone, not just major institutions, will want their own Web3 wallet. As always, do your own research \u2013 this isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "summary": "Solana is displaying signs of strength as it trades with a key chart pattern, which indicates that the altcoin is preparing for a solid move. The price has been holding steady, forming lower highs and higher lows within a narrowing range. This pause in momentum could be setting the stage for another breakout. Key Resistance Levels In Focus As Breakout Approaches Solana has developed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, signaling a continuation of its uptrend. According to Dynamite Trader&#8217;s post on X, this pattern often precedes strong breakouts, suggesting that momentum could soon accelerate. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breakout Watch: Price Could Rally Hard Above $150 Level? Currently, SOL&#8217;s price is holding above the midline of the flag, indicating underlying strength. However, it&#8217;s also testing the daily 100 moving average (MA100), which is acting as a dynamic resistance. SOL&#8217;s reaction to this level will be crucial in determining whether the bullish flag leads to a decisive breakout or a deeper consolidation. Another analyst, Henry, highlighted that Solana is gearing up for a big move after completing a clean Cup and Handle breakout on the 4-hour chart, a bullish pattern that signals continuation. The breakout saw SOL flip the $149 resistance into support, a key technical shift. If this level holds, Henry sees a rally toward the $168 to $174 zone, which aligns with previous resistance levels and bullish extension targets. He adds a warning that volatility is increasing, and high-leverage positions are at risk on both sides. Solana is setting up a clean wedge on the weekly chart. Currently trading at $150, SOL has been consistently bouncing between support and resistance levels, which is known for building pressure before delivering sharp moves. Talking about this, Top G emphasizes that if this plays out as expected, the next leg up could be significant, and $300 isn&#8217;t just speculation; it&#8217;s a realistic target based on the structure and behavior. Holding Above The Breakout Zone Could Accelerate The Move Upward Solana has broken above the downtrend line on the 4-hour chart. This move could mark a pivotal shift in short-term momentum, with potential bullish continuation if current levels hold. Related Reading: Solana Price At \u2018A Very Delicate Level\u2019 \u2013 Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key If SOL maintains its position above this trend line, crypto analyst Bens BTC noted that the price could climb toward the next resistance area at $165. The price action is forming a bullish structure, and momentum indicators may soon align with the breakout, further supporting the continuation of the upside. The asset had broken out with strong momentum and is now trading firmly within a long-term bullish channel, a structure that has supported uptrends. The price action looks clean, with higher highs and higher lows forming as SOL surges upward. Furthermore, analyst Persis10t revealed that momentum is picking up, and as long as the channel remains intact, the path forward could be explosive. If the structure holds and attracts volume, Persis10t projects a target of $700+ in the next run, pointing to the upper boundary of the bullish channel as a magnet for price.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-reaching-9-5-and-37-5/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has provided a detailed breakdown of how the XRP price could reach between $9.5 and $37.5. He alluded to previous cycles as the rationale behind why the altcoin could reach such ambitious targets in this market cycle. Rationale Behind XRP Price Rally To $9.5 And $37.5 In an X post, Egrag Crypto stated that historical cycles show that the XRP price always rises above the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and then retests it. He added that the final move from that retest point to the cycle\u2019s top creates the blowoff peak. In Cycle 1, XRP recorded around a 2,000% gain while the altcoin surged 455% from the retest point in Cycle 2. Related Reading: Analyst Puts XRP Cycle High At $20-$30, Here\u2019s Why Egrag Crypto then applied these percentages to the current cycle to show why the XRP price could reach $9.5 and $37.5. He noted that after the initial surge and retest in April 2025, the EMA will likely rise with the price, setting the stage for the next big move. Based on these historical blowoff phases, the analyst said that XRP could record another 2,000% increase and reach $37.5. On the other hand, the XRP price could mirror the second cycle and record a more conservative 455% rise, which puts the altcoin at $9.5. Egrag Crypto\u2019s accompanying chart showed that XRP could reach either of these targets by September 1 later this year. Meanwhile, the analyst advised market participants to choose their targets wisely. He also told them to set their exit plans, avoid getting caught up in hype, stick to their strategy, and get prepared. Breakout In Progress For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the $2.25 level is loading for the XRP price following its reclaim of the $2.07 level. Based on this price action, she remarked that a breakout was in progress. This $2.25 also represents the macro .382, a key level which the analyst has been alluding to for months. Related Reading: XRP Price Completes Bearish Retest As Macro Signals Point To $2.65 CasiTrades declared that momentum is building for the XRP price and that Ripple\u2019s decision to drop its cross-appeal against the SEC is further fueling this momentum. From the current level, she stated that she is watching two key scenarios in the short term. First, the altcoin could move into $2.30, then pull back to test $2.25 as support. The analyst remarked that this would be \u201cideal and healthy.\u201d For the second scenario, CasiTrades predicts that the XRP price could push harder through to $2.45, which is closer to the $2.69 resistance. Then, the altcoin would witness a slight pullback before touching the $2.69 level with resistance. For this scenario, she believes that a retest of $2.25 later would be expected. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/wave-3-xrp-breaks-structure-fireworks-ahead/",
      "summary": "Hours after Ripple Labs said it would abandon its long-running appeal in its securities case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, watched market technician CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) on X argued that XRP\u2019s price structure has already completed its corrective phase and is \u201cnow wave 3 in motion.\u201d The pseudonymous trader described how Friday\u2019s slide to $2.07 had \u201ctagged\u201d three separate Fibonacci confluence markers\u2014the 0.618 retracement of the March-to-May rally, a 1:1 equality projection for wave C of the prior correction, and a 0.618 extension of sub-wave 5. \u201cThe market snapped upward from that exact price,\u201d she observed, before adding: \u201c$2.07 tagged. $2.25 loading. XRP breakout in progress!\u201d XRP Enters Wave 3 By midday in Europe on Monday XRP was changing hands at $2.19, roughly 4% above Friday\u2019s close and 8.5% higher than a week ago. That recovery has carried the token to the edge of the next \u201cmajor test\u201d cited by CasiTrades: the long-monitored $2.25 zone, which she notes coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement measured from XRP\u2019s 2021 swing high. In classical Elliott Wave analysis, a decisive breach and subsequent retest of that level would validate the start of a powerful third wave, the phase in which momentum typically accelerates and sentiment flips decisively bullish. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish CasiTrades outlined two near-term paths: either a brief thrust to $2.30 followed by a healthy back-test of $2.25, or a more explosive extension toward $2.45\u20132.69 before any significant pull-back. \u201cFrom here, I\u2019m watching two key scenarios short-term: 1) A move into $2.30, then a pullback to backtest $2.25 as support. This would be ideal and healthy. 2) Or, price pushes harder through to ~$2.45, closer toward $2.69 resistance. Has a small pullback, before touching $2.69 with resistance. In this plan, a backtest of $2.25 later would be expected,\u201d Casi writes via X. In either scenario, she argues, the structural message is the same: \u201cFlipping that level opens the door for the next full breakout\u2026 once these local resistances are out of the way \u2192 fireworks.\u201d The technical argument lands at a moment when a key fundamental overhang appears to be fading. On June 27 Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company will withdraw the cross-appeal it filed last year contesting parts of Judge Analisa Torres\u2019s split decision on XRP sales. \u201cWe\u2019re closing this chapter once and for all,\u201d Garlinghouse wrote on X, adding that the SEC \u201cwas also expected to drop its appeal.\u201d The move came one day after Torres rejected a joint request from both parties to shrink Ripple\u2019s civil penalty to $50 million and dissolve her permanent injunction. Related Reading: XRP Bulls On Alert\u2014\u2019This Trendline Is Everything,\u2019 Says Analyst That backdrop helps explain why the Fibonacci \u201cgolden-ratio\u201d bounce at $2.07 drew such an emphatic response. But for now, the market\u2019s focal point is whether XRP can turn the $2.25 shelf from resistance into support. If it does, the next cluster of historical supply sits between $2.60 and $2.70\u2014the area that capped rallies in December 2021 and March 2022. A break beyond that zone would leave little chart resistance before psychological milestones at $3.00 and the all-time closing high near $3.40 set in January 2018. Even so, technicians caution that Elliott Wave targets remain probabilistic, not predictive certainties, and that any new macro-regulatory twist could reset the calculus. Friday\u2019s ruling also left Ripple\u2019s injunction intact, meaning the company must still navigate a compliance regime that did not exist when the lawsuit began in 2020. Whether those realities temper the exuberance around wave 3 remains to be seen. In CasiTrades\u2019 words, however, timing is everything: \u201cThis is exactly why we rely on TA. The charts help us spot setups before the news hits. News hits harder after price has positioned.\u201d For a market that has waited more than four years to see its signature legal saga reach closure, traders appear ready to test that maxim on the road to $2.25\u2014and beyond. At press time, XRP traded at $2.19. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

Input Output Global\u2019s Role Input Output Global (IOG), Hoskinson\u2019s company, will keep guiding Cardano as its core coordinator. He warns this work comes at a cost: \u201cIt\u2019s been brutal and expensive this year,\u201d he said, referring to waves of negative comments and legal threats. He adds that it\u2019s \u201cdehumanizing\u201d to be blamed for every hiccup on the network while not getting credit for the wins. Related Reading: Crypto Bombshell: Developer Claims XRP Could Hit $20,000 Rare Evo Conference In Focus Looking ahead, Hoskinson is counting on Rare Evo, a crypto conference, to reset the conversation. He believes the community will use that event to settle governance questions and update Cardano\u2019s constitution with delegated executive powers. There\u2019s even talk of a sovereign wealth fund to back Bitcoin DeFi on the chain. Built on top of Bitcoin, Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) is a network of decentralized financial applications. Last year, Hoskinson pushed a plan to convert $100 million worth of ADA into stablecoin liquidity. That idea sparked fierce debate. Now, he hopes Rare Evo will help turn bold ideas into solid support. Cardano\u2019s path forward may hinge on blending strong tech work with a clear, unified story. As Bitcoin DeFi edges closer, the project that can tell the best story might win the most attention\u2014and the most funds. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
