      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-gears-60-move-will-it-be-up-or-down/",
      "summary": "An analyst has explained how Dogecoin could be primed for a 60% price move. Here&#8217;s the range that could end up deciding the direction of the break. Dogecoin Is Nearing The End Of A Triangle Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin is currently looking from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 1-day price of DOGE. As displayed in the graph, the daily Dogecoin price has been trading inside what appears to be a triangular channel. A triangle is a TA pattern that forms whenever an asset&#8217;s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 13%: Can Key On-Chain Support Stop The Fall? The upper line of the pattern is likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower one support. A break out of either of the lines can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. There are a few different types of triangles, with a few popular ones being the Symmetrical, Ascending, and Descending variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides the type of the triangle. In a Symmetrical Triangle, the lines converge at a roughly equal and opposite slope. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, both upward and downward volatility shrinks in an even manner. For the Ascending and Descending versions, however, there is a bias to the upside or downside. In the former, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis and the price progressively makes higher lows. Similarly, the latter involves lower highs with a flat support level. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the Triangle that Dogecoin has been moving inside for the past few months is similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it has a slight tilt toward the downside. It&#8217;s also visible that DOGE is nearing in on the end of the triangle. Generally, triangle breakouts become more likely to occur as the asset approaches the apex, as the consolidation range squeezes tight in this region. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend\u2014But Can They Keep It Up? Considering that Dogecoin may be in this zone now, it&#8217;s possible that its spring may be ready to uncoil. Based on the pattern forming in the daily price, the analyst has noted that DOGE looks primed for a 60% move. As for which way a break would happen, that naturally comes down to which line the memecoin exits the triangle from. &#8221; All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend,&#8221; notes Martinez. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, down more than 11% over the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin continues to trade below its recent all-time high as selling pressure and macroeconomic developments keep the asset in consolidation. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $104,835, down 2.1% over the past week and around 6.3% off from its peak of $111,814 recorded last month. Despite the broader trend, on-chain data reveals emerging patterns that may signal what could come next in the market. Following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting, analysts have noted diverging trends in Bitcoin\u2019s price and derivatives market activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Momentum Wobbles\u2014Analyst Predicts Correction Below $94K Derivatives Deleveraging and Liquidation Clusters Shape Price Structure According to Amr Taha, a contributor on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, BTC has been hovering above the $104,000 support zone, where strong demand appears to be absorbing sell pressure. However, Taha pointed out that open interest on Binance has declined, forming lower lows, a sign that the derivatives market is undergoing progressive deleveraging. Taha\u2019s analysis emphasized a technical divergence: while price has remained relatively stable around the $104,000 level, open interest has been falling. This divergence suggests that traders are reducing leveraged positions, possibly due to market uncertainty or as a response to the Fed\u2019s cautious stance. Notably, the $104K region has emerged as a critical liquidity pocket, with data showing long positions being liquidated massively in this area. The dominance of long-side liquidations, with few short liquidations, reflects a flush-out of recent entrants attempting to ride the previous rally. The analyst argued that this deleveraging phase could pave the way for a price rebound if macro conditions remain favorable. Historically, Bitcoin has responded positively to rate pauses, often resuming upward movement when signs of seller exhaustion appear. The stabilization of open interest, combined with reduced liquidations, might act as a foundation for a new upward push in the near term. Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance and Shifts in Market Behavior In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Oinonen, highlighted growing whale activity on Binance. Since 2023, the whale ratio metric on the exchange has surged dramatically, climbing from 0.08 in mid-2023 to as high as 0.77 in 2025. This shift marks a 400% increase and indicates significant accumulation behavior among large holders. Whale inflows and retention on Binance have generally coincided with longer-term confidence during periods of market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Channel Break Below $105,000 Sparks Panic, Analysts Predict Further Crashes Moreover, the data shows that during recent episodes of elevated volatility, Binance users have leaned toward holding rather than exiting positions. Inflows to the platform have remained low, particularly from both whales and retail participants, suggesting that market participants are refraining from panic selling and instead are anticipating future price appreciation.
