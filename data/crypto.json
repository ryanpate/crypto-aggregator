The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency climbed above $105,000 for the second time this week. At press time, it was trading at nearly $104,000, up 0.50% over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits\u2014Analyst Reveals Key Insight Historical RSI Breakouts Could Signal New Push According to the charts shared by Moustache, Bitcoin\u2019s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) tends to surge into overbought territory just before major rallies. Back in July 2013, Bitcoin sat at $66, then jumped to nearly $1,120 by November as the RSI hit high levels. A similar spike happened in May 2017, when BTC rose from about $1,300 to $19,700 by December. On April 1, 2021, Bitcoin reached $64,800 while the RSI again climbed beyond its usual range. In 2024, those RSI peaks came on March 1 at $73,800 and again in November when it cleared $100,000. #Bitcoin$BTC monthly RSI is so close to entering overbought territory.

Over the last 10 days, wallets with at least 10 BTC rose by 231 addresses. At the same time, retail wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC fell by 37,460 addresses. That shift suggests big players are using recent dips as a buying chance.

In past runs, Bitcoin often paused or pulled back for days or even weeks before the real rally got underway. Sometimes the RSI stayed elevated while prices drifted sideways. In 2017, for example, a correction followed the high RSI but the broader uptrend kept going. Today\u2019s RSI is near those same levels\u2014and could linger there for a while.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/if-bitcoin-hits-92800/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price crashed from as high as $106,000 to $102,000 on June 20, sparking sell-offs among investors. Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn\u2019t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC\u2019s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. Bulls Need To Step In For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-charts-signal-potential-bottom-all-eyes-on-next-move/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is once again trading at critical demand levels, testing the lower boundary of a six-week range that began forming in early May. After briefly climbing toward $2,800 earlier this month, ETH has retraced back to the $2,400 zone, reigniting debate about whether this is a healthy consolidation or a sign of further downside to come. Despite the pressure, Ethereum has not broken below this range, signaling that buyers continue to step in at these levels. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels \u2013 Here\u2019s Why This extended consolidation period suggests a decisive move is nearing. Breakouts from tight ranges like this one often lead to strong directional momentum, and ETH\u2019s current price structure could act as a launchpad\u2014if bulls regain control. According to top analyst M-log1, Ethereum may have already bottomed during its most recent retrace, with the current action reflecting accumulation rather than weakness. The ETH/BTC ratio, another critical chart watched by traders, is also hovering near support levels, implying that a rotation back into altcoins may be imminent if Ethereum holds or pushes higher. For now, the market watches closely, as ETH\u2019s next move could set the tone for broader altcoin performance in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Holds Range As Market Awaits Decisive Break Ethereum continues to trade within a tight consolidation range that began in early May, showing resilience despite growing global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. The price has hovered between $2,360 and $2,700, forming a narrow channel as buyers and sellers remain locked in a standoff. With conflicts in the Middle East intensifying and financial markets reacting to high interest rates and rising Treasury yields, crypto assets are under pressure, and Ethereum is no exception. The long-anticipated altseason has yet to materialize, and Ethereum is widely seen as the key to unlocking that next phase. ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract and DeFi space gives it a central role in leading altcoin market momentum. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring its current range, especially after M-log1 shared analysis suggesting the recent low at $2,360 could mark a local bottom. According to M-log1, Ethereum is now consolidating just below the $2,450 level, and this zone could serve as a bullish trigger if reclaimed with strength. A decisive move in either direction will likely set the tone for the broader crypto market, with a breakout above $2,500 potentially igniting the next leg upward. Until then, market participants are watching closely. If ETH fails to hold these demand levels, the range could break to the downside, delaying any altseason rally further. But if bulls regain control and push above key resistance, it could signal the start of a much-anticipated upward move. In this environment of uncertainty, Ethereum\u2019s next breakout-or breakdown\u2014could prove pivotal for market sentiment heading into the second half of the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Key Support As Price Retraces Ethereum is currently trading at $2,405, down 4.17% in the last session, after testing a low of $2,367. The chart reveals that ETH has retraced back to the lower boundary of a six-week range, confirming strong demand in the $2,360\u2013$2,400 area. This zone has acted as a critical support level multiple times, with bulls stepping in each time to defend it. The price remains trapped below the 200-day moving average ($2,774), which has proven to be a strong resistance. Meanwhile, both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are trending below price, currently sitting at $2,287 and $2,640, respectively, tightening the range even more. This compression typically leads to high volatility once a breakout occurs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern \u2013 $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Volume has remained elevated during recent sessions, suggesting that buyers and sellers are actively competing for control.

Conversely, if bulls manage to reclaim $2,500 and sustain momentum toward the $2,700\u2013$2,800 resistance band, it may set the stage for a breakout.

      "summary": "After another strong play for its all-time high in the past week, the price of Bitcoin has struggled to build on its recent bullish momentum. Over the last few days, the premier cryptocurrency has been specifically slow and lethargic. On Friday, June 20, the Bitcoin price took a severe hit \u2014 together with the rest of the crypto market \u2014 and fell briefly beneath the $103,000 mark. However, the latest market data suggests that the price of BTC might enjoy some stability after the recent round of long liquidations. BTC Gearing For A Run Of &#8216;Healthier Price Action&#8217;: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha explained the dynamics between the Bitcoin price and its recent long liquidation event. According to the online pundit, the market leader could be preparing for more stable price action over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout? On-Chain Signals Say \u2018Watch This Level\u2019 Taha revealed that the critical $103,000 liquidation cluster, which held a large volume of overleveraged long positions on Binance, has been cleared off. This cascade of long liquidations came after the price of Bitcoin plunged toward the $102,500 level on Friday evening. According to data from CryptoQuant, the price decline caused the long liquidations on Binance, the world\u2019s largest exchange by trading volume, to exceed $160 million. The on-chain analyst noted that this long liquidation event also coincided with a major change in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume on the cryptocurrency exchange. Taha highlighted that the Net Taker Volume has moved deep into the negative territory, falling to nearly -$100 million in the past day. As observed in the chart below, this latest plunge marks the third time the Net taker Volume has fallen to this level in the month of June. According to Taha, the change in this metric suggests that aggressive selling outweighed buying activity during the liquidation event. The on-chain analyst outlines two possible reasons for this trend, including that long positions were forced to close, pushing sell orders into the market as the Bitcoin price fell below $103,000. Taha added that some sections of Bitcoin retail traders might have pushed the panic button and filled new sell orders in fear of further losses. In the end, the crypto analyst concluded that the combination of long liquidations and extremely negative Net Taker Volume might not be completely bad for the flagship cryptocurrency. Taha said: While such events often feel devastating in the moment, they lay the groundwork for healthier price action. Given these dynamics, the path of least resistance may now shift upward as Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels with reduced leverage overhead. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,450, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout?

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-energy-usage-surges-108-smart-contract-activity-accelerates/",
      "summary": "Tron (TRX) has captured investor attention once again with major developments surrounding its future. On Monday, Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment (SRM.O) confirmed a strategic agreement with Tron founder Justin Sun. The deal will see SRM acquire Tron tokens, rebrand itself as &#8220;Tron Inc.,&#8221; and onboard Sun as an adviser, effectively bringing Tron closer to becoming a publicly traded entity. This marks a historic shift for the blockchain industry and positions Tron in a unique space among crypto projects. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels \u2013 Here\u2019s Why However, the market backdrop is anything but calm. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have sparked sharp volatility across risk assets, including Tron. While the token\u2019s price has fluctuated significantly, long-term metrics suggest underlying strength in the network. According to new CryptoQuant data, TRON\u2019s total daily energy consumption\u2014an important measure of smart contract execution and user activity\u2014has surged 108% year-over-year. It now sits at 200 billion energy units per day, compared to just 77 billion a year ago. Notably, 80% of this demand originates from staked TRX, indicating robust participation in the protocol and a significant increase in smart contract interactions. Together, these factors underscore Tron&#8217;s growing relevance as both a technical platform and a public-facing blockchain enterprise. Tron Trades Near Key Demand Amid Broader Market Pullback Tron is currently testing key demand levels after a 9% correction from its recent high near $0.295. The price had briefly surged on Monday after the announcement of Tron\u2019s plans to go public through a deal with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment. However, the excitement was short-lived. As macroeconomic uncertainty deepens and Middle East conflicts escalate, the entire crypto market has entered a retracement phase, dragging TRX below the levels it traded at prior to the news. Despite the challenging conditions, on-chain fundamentals paint a much more resilient picture. CryptoQuant data shows that Tron\u2019s network activity remains robust, with energy consumption\u2014used to execute smart contracts\u2014up 108% year-over-year. Total daily energy usage now exceeds 200 billion units, compared to just 77 billion at the same time last year. This surge in energy use signals growing demand for on-chain operations and smart contract execution. Importantly, about 80% of this energy demand comes from staked TRX, pointing to strong user commitment to the network and increased participation in decentralized applications. The divergence between TRX\u2019s on-chain strength and its current price performance suggests that the recent pullback may be more about broader market stress than any deterioration in Tron\u2019s fundamentals. If volatility stabilizes, these robust activity metrics could help position Tron for a strong recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason TRX Price Holds Trendline Support Despite Volatile Reversal Tron is currently trading at $0.2730, showing a modest 9% pullback from the $0.295 high reached earlier this week following the announcement of a deal involving SRM Entertainment. Price action in the chart reflects this volatile reaction\u2014after spiking, TRX retraced sharply and is now consolidating just above the 50-day moving average (blue line), which has acted as dynamic support over the past two months. Despite this pullback, the structure remains bullish. TRX continues to respect the long-term ascending trendline formed since early March, with higher lows being maintained. Volume surged during the initial rally on the announcement but has since returned to pre-news levels, indicating fading short-term hype and a return to fundamentals. Looking at the broader setup, the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (green and red lines) remain sloped upward, reflecting sustained long-term momentum. The $0.269\u2013$0.253 support band, defined by these MAs, will be key if further downside pressure materializes. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close \u2013 Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent A break above $0.295 would invalidate this short-term pullback and potentially ignite a move toward $0.32. Conversely, failure to hold the trendline could trigger a deeper retracement. For now, TRX holds structure\u2014yet caution remains warranted given broader market uncertainty.
