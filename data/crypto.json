      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/toncoin-walks-a-tightrope/",
      "summary": "In a recent post on X, Michael Steinbach highlighted that Toncoin\u2019s current price is at $2.80, which he considers one of the most exciting levels of the year. With momentum building, Steinbach noted that traders everywhere are now asking the same question: Is a breakout finally underway, or is a sharp sell-off just around the corner? Toncoin Locked In A Narrow Range Between $2.70 And $2.80 Analyzing the daily chart, Michael Steinbach points out that Toncoin has been locked in a tight range between $2.70 as support and $2.80 as resistance for several weeks now. He warns that jumping into the market without a clear plan is a recipe for losses, especially when others are already navigating these well-defined zones with precision. Related Reading: Toncoin Heading Toward 40% Breakout, Pattern Could Suggest He highlights the RSI sitting at 39, a relatively weak position. While it&#8217;s not yet in oversold territory, Steinbach notes that buyers may be holding off for deeper levels. Back in April, a strong rebound occurred from below 30, making the 30\u201332 zone a critical area to watch for potential bullish reactions. In terms of risk, Steinbach warns that a break below the $2.70 support could hand control over to the bears. If that level fails, the next downside targets to watch are $2.50 and, in a worst-case scenario, $2.00. He reminds traders that repeated tests of a support zone tend to weaken it over time, and when it finally cracks, the fallout can come fast. Whether watching for a breakout or a breakdown, having a plan is essential. Reacting after the crowd moves rarely pays off; it\u2019s the calm, pre-planned decisions that give traders the edge when volatility strikes. Breakout Or Pullback? Define The Setup Before Entering In outlining the bullish scenario, the analyst noted that if Toncoin manages to secure a daily close above the $2.80 resistance, momentum could quickly follow through. This breakout could open the path toward $3.00, with an extended target near $3.40, representing a potential 26% gain from current levels. That\u2019s the kind of upside savvy traders prepare for. Related Reading: Toncoin Rises 13% On Telegram\u2019s $300 Million Deal With Elon Musk\u2019s xAI So, what\u2019s the key takeaway? According to the analyst, successful trading doesn\u2019t rely on gut feeling; it requires well-defined triggers. That means either entering on a confirmed breakout above $2.80 with a stop-loss just below, or stepping back and waiting for a pullback that aligns with RSI signals. The focus should always be on minimizing risk while allowing profits room to grow. As for now, the analyst sees the trend as sideways to slightly bearish. Until the chart sends a crystal-clear signal, the best approach is patience \u2014 no FOMO trades, no blind bets, just disciplined setups. Featured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com"

Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $107K As US Senate Clears $4.5T Spending Bill According to CryptoQuant, that price point lines up with past peaks in realized gains for those who have kept their coins untouched for at least six months. &#8216;Market Magnet&#8217; Theory CryptoQuant used the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio to track how deep in profit holders are right now. Based on reports, the average realized profit for long\u2011term holders stands at about 220%. That sounds healthy. But in March and December 2024, holders were sitting on roughly 300% and 350% gains, respectively. The gap between today\u2019s 220% and those earlier highs is what Darkfost, a CryptoQuant contributor, calls a form of \u201cmarket magnet.\u201d Many are calling for $140,000 BTC so that unrealized profits match the cycle\u2019s top levels. Profit\u2011Taking Trends Long\u2011term investors have been selling as Bitcoin flirts with new highs. Recent data shows that these holders have driven much of the selling pressure in the past few weeks. The average cost basis for this group \u2014 the realized price \u2014 is near $33,800. That means anyone buying before six months ago would need Bitcoin to reach $33,800 just to break even. And to hit the profit levels of March and December 2024, BTC must climb to $140,000. This dynamic pushes some traders to lock in gains early, while others hold on for bigger moves. Super Majority Still In The Green Based on reports, a super majority of Bitcoin investors are sitting on unrealized profits worth a combined $2.5 trillion. That number reflects the overall strength of the market\u2019s recent rally. Even so, many investors remain confident that fresh buying can soak up any waves of profit\u2011taking. The current phase feels like a pause. Buyers and sellers are sizing each other up. The question now is whether demand will pick up enough to drive that magnet\u2011level price.

They added that the bull run might only have several months left before a final surge and then a change in trend. If this view holds, that final push could be the moment when BTC nears or even hits $140,000. After that, history suggests a sharp peak and then a cool-down.

      "summary": "Ethereum has regained strong bullish momentum over the past few days, rising more than 23% since June 22 and reclaiming the critical $2,600 level. After weeks of uncertainty and sideways movement, ETH is showing signs of strength, with bulls now eyeing a push toward the $2,700 resistance zone. A successful reclaim of this level could open the doors for a broader rally, potentially reigniting hopes for the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Tron DeFi Activity Expands: SunSwap Hits $3B+ Monthly Swaps In 2025 While volatility remains in the broader market, Ethereum\u2019s recovery has been notable, especially as macroeconomic sentiment improves and risk appetite increases across both equities and crypto. The surge in price has brought renewed attention to ETH\u2019s long-term outlook, with top analyst Ted Pillows stating that \u201cETH is looking good and going above $10,000 this cycle.\u201d This bold projection reflects growing confidence among market participants that Ethereum still holds major upside potential, particularly as network fundamentals strengthen and institutional interest grows. With the $2,700 level acting as the next critical resistance, all eyes are on whether Ethereum can maintain its momentum and set the stage for the next leg higher. The coming days will be essential in confirming whether this rally has staying power or remains short-lived. Ethereum Faces Critical Test As Altcoin Market Watches Closely After a week of volatility, Ethereum surged 9% yesterday, pushing closer to the top of its long-standing range and signaling the potential for a major breakout. Trading between $2,200 and $2,800 since early May, ETH has now returned to the upper end of this consolidation zone. Market participants believe this could be the turning point, not just for Ethereum, but for the entire altcoin market. Ethereum remains the backbone of the altcoin ecosystem, and its price action has historically dictated the momentum of the broader crypto space. A decisive move above $2,800 could trigger a wave of breakouts across major altcoins, many of which remain suppressed under key resistance levels. While short-term volatility remains a concern, analysts argue that Ethereum is showing strong signs of resilience and accumulation. Ted Pillows shared his technical perspective, urging traders to stay focused on the bigger picture: \u201cDon\u2019t let short-term volatility scare you.&#8221; According to him, Ethereum will surpass $10,000 this cycle. His view reflects growing confidence among experienced investors who see Ethereum\u2019s current structure as a launchpad for the next expansion phase. With Ethereum at a critical technical juncture and altcoins waiting for confirmation, the coming days could be pivotal. A breakout above $2,800 would validate growing bullish sentiment and potentially spark the long-anticipated altseason.

ETH Tests 200-Day MA After Breakout Ethereum is showing renewed strength after reclaiming the $2,600 level and closing above all major moving averages on the daily chart. As seen in the image, ETH surged through the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which had been acting as dynamic resistance near $2,516. This marks a significant technical milestone, indicating bullish momentum may be returning. The breakout candle is backed by rising volume, a positive sign that the move is supported by real market participation. If ETH can hold above the 200-day MA, the next critical level to watch is $2,700 \u2014 the top of the range that has held since early May. A decisive close above $2,700 would open the door for further gains, potentially testing the $2,900\u2013$3,000 resistance zone. Related Reading: Solana Hits New Milestone: Wallets Holding 0.1+ SOL Reach Record High Support remains near the $2,500 level, where the 50-day and 100-day MAs converge, offering a strong confluence zone should any pullback occur.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-4-years-rise-to-149000/",
      "summary": "According to a new analysis shared by crypto analyst Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d Severino, Bitcoin has just closed the quarterly chart with a perfected TD9 sell setup. This is actually interesting, because it adds a possibly long timeline before Bitcoin can reach any further significant price target. Most of Bitcoin&#8217;s daily candles in the past seven days have shown mild upward pressure supported by positive sentiment from various technical analyses. However, according to the TD9 setup, Bitcoin could take up to four years to reach $149,000. TD9 Setup Hints At Slow Climb To $149,000 The TD9 is a component of the TD Sequential indicator, which is often used to identify trend exhaustion, potential reversals, and possible trend changes. Interestingly, what makes this particular signal notable at this point is that it is now projecting a TD Risk level of $149,490, which is essentially a price target for Bitcoin. But if past patterns on the TD9 indicator are anything to go by, getting there might take much longer than bulls expect. Related Reading: Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement In 2017, a similar perfected TD9 appeared during Bitcoin\u2019s first rally to $20,000. At the time, the TD Risk was projected at $35,000. It wasn\u2019t until late 2020, roughly four years later, that Bitcoin finally reached and broke above that level. A prior occurrence in 2014 offered the same story. Back then in 2014, the TD9 setup projected a TD Risk of $2,400, but it took approximately 3.5 years to cross that threshold. Now, despite the bullish sentiment today, this historical precedent suggests it could take similar years before the $149,490 target being currently projected by the TD Risk is finally tested or breached. The 3-month candlestick price chart shown above provides a visual analysis of this projection. From the 2014 cycle low, it took 915 days across 10 quarterly candles for Bitcoin to reach its next high. After the 2017 signal, it took 1,096 days (or 12 quarterly candlesticks) for BTC to finally surpass the projected TD Risk level. Bitcoin Price Action On Gradual Climb Bitcoin has spent the past seven days in a steady but modest uptrend, rising approximately 1.5% from a weekly low around $105,430 to the current range between $109,240 and $109,600. During this move, Bitcoin&#8217;s price action tested and retested resistance in the $108,200 to $108,800 zone several times in the past 24 hours. However, it ultimately pushed higher, showing a slow but stable bullish undertone. Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 \u2014 Details At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,330, up by 2% in the past 24 hours. It is currently about a 36% move away from reaching the $149,490 price target. However, if Tony Severino&#8217;s timeline on the TD9 Risk setup does play out, it wouldn&#8217;t be until sometime around July 2029 before Bitcoin reaches the $149,490 price target.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-detonate-shorty-target/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin was changing hands near $0.174 in European trading on Thursday, extending a two-day rebound that began when buyers twice defended the mid-June floor around $0.16. The 11% recovery since the Tuesday low has put the largest memecoin back on traders\u2019 radars, but technical analyst More Crypto Online cautions that what looks like an impulsive burst is in fact \u201call corrective in nature,\u201d with the market still trapped inside a complex diagonal wave pattern that could just as easily fail. Dogecoin Is Quietly Coiling For A Potential Breakout In a video update recorded on 2 June, the analyst dissected the one-hour chart and concluded that the advance from the 22 June low is best counted as a three-wave move. \u201cBecause wave 1 \u2026 was only a three-wave move, the third wave should unfold as an ABC structure,\u201d he said, underscoring that the rally lacks the five-wave DNA of a trend reversal. Even so, as long as Dogecoin defends what he called a \u201cmicro-support area between $0.16 and $0.166,\u201d the diagonal remains valid and a measured target at $0.196\u2014the 138 percent Fibonacci extension of wave 1\u2014\u201cremains plausible.\u201d The roadmap is conditional. First, the current A-wave has to finish; then a corrective B-wave should follow, \u201cand in the C-wave we could then rally to round about $0.196.\u201d A probe toward $0.182 before that pullback cannot be ruled out, but the analyst warned viewers not to assume a straight shot higher. \u201cPlease be aware that we could be dealing with very choppy and messy structures,\u201d he said. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under $0.20 \u2018Is Free,\u2019 Says Analyst\u2014Predicts 2,000% Upside If bulls do force a full five-wave climb from the July swing low, that sequence would mark the first leg of a larger five-wave advance\u2014a textbook signal that the broader down-trend from Dogecoin\u2019s March peak may finally be exhausted. Failure to hold $0.16, however, would invalidate the diagonal count and expose the June lows near $0.151, where on-chain data show a thin layer of spot bids and little derivative support. Market context is mixed. CoinGecko data show Dogecoin\u2019s 24-hour turnover has topped $1.5 billion, roughly in line with last week\u2019s average, while the memecoin\u2019s correlation with Bitcoin has weakened to 0.62, its lowest reading since early May. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit In the short term, though, all eyes are on the $0.16 band. As More Crypto Online summed up, \u201cThe diagonal pattern basically remains plausible as long as we\u2019re holding that $0.16 level.\u201d Should that floor survive the inevitable B-wave turbulence, Dogecoin\u2019s \u201cquiet setup\u201d might indeed detonate shortly\u2014propelling the token toward $0.196 and potentially signalling a more durable trend change. Notably, the upper boundary of Dogecoin\u2019s long-running descending channel in the daily chart, now situated near $0.20, lines up almost exactly with More Crypto Online\u2019s bullish target. A decisive breakout through this confluence would not only pierce the ceiling that has capped prices since the December 8 high at $0.4843 but could also validate the analyst\u2019s call for a trend reversal. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.174. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
