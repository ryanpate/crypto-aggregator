      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/researchers-forecast-bitcoin-at-4-3-million-by-2036-citing-institutional-demand/",
      "summary": "In a striking forecast, two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, have predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to an astonishing $4.3 million by 2036 if institutional buying trends continue. This prediction was highlighted by market expert Giovanni Incasa, who emphasized the significance of applying rigorous supply-demand theories to Bitcoin&#8217;s unique economic structure. Supply Shock Warning Rudd and Porter have employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin&#8217;s market dynamics, warning that the impending supply shock could lead to price fluctuations ten times more severe than anything seen to date. Their findings suggest that the effects of this supply shock will result in permanent wealth redistribution, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge According to their conservative estimates, the Bitcoin price could reach $2.2 million per coin by 2036, a projection rooted in what they describe as &#8220;economic physics.&#8221; The researchers note that the current liquid supply of Bitcoin stands at only 11.2 million coins, with an estimated 4 million Bitcoin lost forever due to lost keys and Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s unspent stash. Their analysis reveals that only half of BTC\u2019s total supply is actively liquid, meaning that even modest institutional purchases could lead to significant supply shortages. Evidence of this trend can be seen in the daily buying habits of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have averaged 285 Bitcoin per day since their launch, and the actions of Bitcoin treasury companies that are removing thousands of coins from circulation through debt financing. Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a strategic reserve of one million Bitcoin, which would involve an acquisition of approximately 550 coins per day over five years. The researchers calculate that if 2,000 Bitcoin are removed from circulation daily, the price could reach $106,000\u2014a figure that is already close to today&#8217;s trading price of $104,800, suggesting that their mathematical framework is holding true. The crux of the researchers&#8217; findings is that traditional supply curves are not applicable to BTC. Its perfectly inelastic supply creates significant bottlenecks as demand rises, leading to dramatic price increases. They emphasize that institutions that delay their investments risk becoming permanently priced out of the market. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Rudd and Porter outline three potential scenarios for Bitcoin&#8217;s future. In a conservative scenario, with a 20-fold increase in demand and continued institutional adoption leading to 2,000 daily Bitcoin withdrawals, prices could reach $2.2 million by 2036. Their bullish scenario posits a 30-fold demand growth, where Bitcoin could hit $5 million by early 2031. The most extreme, hyperbolic scenario anticipates a 40-fold demand increase, with daily withdrawals escalating to 4,000 Bitcoin, potentially driving prices to $4.3 million by 2036 and valuing Bitcoin at six times the current market cap of gold.

      "summary": "After more than five weeks of unrelenting downside pressure, Cardano (ADA) finds itself approaching a potentially decisive juncture. In a new analysis published June 18, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) offered a fresh take on ADA\u2019s price structure, warning that the final leg of a downward five-wave Elliott pattern may now be unfolding\u2014with a critical resolution point drawing near. How Low Can Cardano Crash? \u201cWe dropped down into that second wave&#8230; and had it highlighted, it bounced from there. So we did call that correctly,\u201d the analyst began, referencing earlier predictions. But despite the brief bounce, he now sees a more extended impulse playing out. \u201cIt does look like we&#8217;re turning this into more of a five-wave move down. So one, two, three, four, and working on a fifth wave now,\u201d he explained while analyzing the one-day chart of ADA. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week \u2013 Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? At the core of the bearish outlook is Fibonacci confluence. Quantum Ascend pointed out that ADA currently hovers around the 0.702 retracement level, with the 0.786 level lying just beneath it\u2014both key zones often associated with deeper corrections in Elliott Wave theory. \u201cMakes complete sense for us to go ahead and drop in right to this area at the very minimum,\u201d he noted. Yet despite the grim technicals, the analyst maintains that no structural damage has occurred\u2014at least not yet. \u201cAs long as we hold the 51 cent level, nothing&#8217;s broken, it&#8217;s not a problem, right?\u201d he reassured. The broader context, however, is less encouraging: \u201cWe need Bitcoin to catch a little bit of a bid or Ethereum or something. We need some kind of good news to come in to alleviate a little bit of this because the market\u2019s just pretty much been bleeding\u2026 for over a month now.\u201d ADA has underperformed relative to its peers since early May, with sentiment sliding alongside price. But Quantum Ascend encouraged viewers not to overreact to the current downtrend. \u201cAll it is is an opportunity to dollar cost average,\u201d he said, before addressing the exhaustion many long-term holders are feeling. \u201cI know what you&#8217;re saying, QA. I&#8217;ve been dollar cost averaging for seven months. I get it. I&#8217;ve been there.\u201d Related Reading: Nasdaq Says Yes To Cardano: ADA Earns A Spot Among Crypto Giants Rather than panic-sell or obsess over day-to-day moves, the analyst recommended mental distance and patience. \u201cGo do something fun, it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s summer. Go do something else, anything else. But this thing is gonna resolve itself and alt season is around the corner,\u201d he said. Despite short-term bearishness in the chart, his long-term conviction remains intact. \u201cWorld War III is not starting. I could not have more conviction in all those things.\u201d With ADA potentially entering the final leg of a corrective structure and broader markets searching for a catalyst, all eyes are now on whether support zones hold\u2014or if Cardano is headed even lower before the long-awaited resolution finally arrives.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cryptos-unlikely-ally-top-analyst-reveals-war-as-a-surprising-bullish-force/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Cyclop has made a potentially significant statement, claiming that the ongoing crisis between Israel and Iran may inadvertently boost the performance of digital assets. Despite recent volatility, which saw a sell-off of approximately $140 billion in the crypto market, Cyclop&#8217;s long-term analysis reveals a more optimistic outlook for the broader digital asset industry. Analyst Predicts Bullish Trends For Crypto Amid Conflicts In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Cyclop pointed to historical patterns that suggest geopolitical tensions often lead to bullish trends in cryptocurrency. Citing specific instances from April and October 2024, he noted that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced an initial decline of 18% and 10% respectively during these conflicts, only to rebound with impressive gains of 28% and 62% shortly thereafter. This trend, he argues, indicates a recurring cycle where war-related dips in crypto prices eventually transform into significant growth, as can be depicted in the chart below shared by Cyclop. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge The analyst explains that while such conflicts can trigger short-term bearish movements, the overarching impact tends to be favorable for cryptocurrencies. As wars ignite fears of inflation and instability, Cyclop has noted that many investors for the traditional finance arena turn to crypto as a hedge against weakening fiat currencies. Unlike traditional bank accounts, cryptocurrencies are not subject to freezing, he said, making them appealing during times of geopolitical unrest. Increasingly, digital currencies are being viewed as a form of &#8220;digital gold,&#8221; a safe haven in tumultuous times. Favorable Macroeconomic Factors The current market dynamics echo previous events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and US-Iran tensions in 2020, which similarly resulted in temporary dips followed by recoveries. Cyclop remains confident that the present situation will yield similar outcomes, despite the typical summer slowdown that often affects market activity. Supporting this bullish sentiment are favorable macroeconomic factors. Recent developments indicate that the US and China have reached a compromise, easing tariffs and aiming to stabilize global supply chains. This move is expected to help cool inflation and restore investor confidence. Moreover, President Donald Trump&#8217;s decision to delay new tariffs has contributed to a more risk-friendly environment, allowing liquidity to flow back into crypto markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sets The Stage For A Liftoff With Key Reversal Pattern Further aiding this positive outlook is the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed a modest increase of just 0.1% month-over-month, slightly below forecasts. With year-over-year inflation at 2.4%\u2014down from an expected 2.5%\u2014the Federal Reserve (Fed) is now anticipated to cut interest rates twice by the end of the year. Historically, such rate cuts have been bullish for cryptocurrencies, as they often lead to increased liquidity in the markets. While the immediate aftermath of the Israel-Iran conflict may present challenges, historical data suggests that cryptocurrencies have the potential to thrive in such environments.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-volume-surges-100/",
      "summary": "Amid the chaos that was sparked by Israel\u2019s attack on Iran, Bitcoin has climbed again, shaking off the losses triggered by the conflict. Not only has the price seen an increase from its last week\u2019s lows, but there has also been a notable change in the cryptocurrency\u2019s daily trading volume. This points to continued interest despite global factors and could mean that the expectations of war are already getting priced in for the crypto market. Bitcoin Sees Almost 100% Jump In Volume According to data from Coinglass, there has been a turn in the tide for the Bitcoin trading volume after starting out the new week in a slow trend. Sunday and Monday had seen the Bitcoin daily trading volume come out under $50 billion. However, as the Bitcoin price rose leading up to Tuesday, so did the trading volume. Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT\u2019s Volume? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin daily trading volume had already crossed $88 billion for Tuesday, leading to an almost 100% increase in the trading volume during this time. This follows the trend of high volatility coming with increased volumes as the Bitcoin price swung wildly between $105,000 and $108,000. The sharp jump in volume comes as the Bitcoin open interest remains high at near all-time highs while the rest of the market struggles. Coinglass data shows the current open interest at $71 billion, less than $10 billion away from the $80 billion all-time high recorded in May 2025. In light of altcoins continuing to trend low while Bitcoin remains close to all-time highs, it suggests that most of the attention in the crypto market is now being focused on Bitcoin. As a result, the leading asset continues to dictate the direction of the market, with dominance remaining high above 64%. How War Could Affect This Trend The positive developments surrounding Bitcoin are coming as there seems to be a cooldown in the conflict in the Middle East. But with so little time having passed, expectations are that the war may only be starting, with some calling it the start of \u2018World War 3.\u2019 Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming The Kobeissi Letter has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to address these World War 3 predictions, revealing how the markets would react if there really was a possibility of this happening.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-staking-hits-35m-eth-is-a-major-price-explosion-on-the-horizon/",
      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a notable pullback after a brief period of upward momentum earlier this month. The asset, which surged past the $2,800 level in mid-June, has since declined by 8.7% over the past week, now trading at around $2,498. This retreat follows broader market consolidation, as Ethereum struggles to maintain upward pressure despite strong on-chain activity. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues \u2013 Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Ethereum Staking and Accumulation Trends While ETH&#8217;s price action has turned negative, on-chain indicators suggest a contrasting narrative of growing investor conviction. According to insights shared by on-chain analyst OnChainSchool via CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, Ethereum has set a new record in staking activity. In the first half of June alone, more than 500,000 ETH were staked, pushing the total locked amount to over 35 million ETH. This growth in staked ETH not only reflects rising validator participation but also contributes to reducing the circulating supply, a dynamic that may influence future price movements. The report also highlights a rise in accumulation addresses, wallets that have received ETH but have never transferred any out. These addresses now collectively hold 22.8 million ETH, another all-time high. This trend is often interpreted as a sign of long-term holding behavior and suggests that certain investor cohorts are positioning themselves for future price appreciation rather than short-term gains. Taken together, the record levels of staking and accumulation point toward an increasingly illiquid supply, which, if demand increases, could amplify upward price pressure. Ethereum Hits ATH in Staking: Over 35 Million ETH Locked \u201cAlongside this, Accumulation Addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH.\u201d \u2013 By @onchainschool Read more \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/WYoX9qpODZ pic.twitter.com/6MAlK0sCfJ \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 17, 2025 A Technical Look: Price Explosion on the Horizon? In addition to the on-chain data, market participants are also analyzing Ethereum from a technical perspective. A crypto analyst on X operating under the pseudonym \u201cBitcoinsensus\u201d has drawn attention to a multi-year \u201cbullish flag\u201d pattern forming on ETH charts since 2021.
