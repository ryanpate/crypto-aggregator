      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price activity has been characterized by sharp swings as global uncertainties persist, particularly following the escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran. After plunging by nearly 5% amid the rising geopolitical strain, Bitcoin managed to recover, bouncing back above $105,000 and currently trading around $106,800. The past 24 hours have been highlighted by Bitcoin recovering toward $108,000 briefly again, but with escalating tensions in the Middle East, there&#8217;s a good chance it could crash soon. This aligns with an outlook from a crypto analyst, who noted that Bitcoin might crash toward $100,000. Resistance Band Faces Test For Bitcoin According to crypto analyst Pejman_Zwin on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is hovering within a confluence of resistance and short liquidation zones, stretching from $105,330 to $107,120. This range, he notes, is not only a structural resistance zone but also corresponds with the cumulative short liquidation leverage area. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions Basically, this means there&#8217;s a high possibility of an intensified price volatility if this zone is challenged or broken. The charts also reveal the presence of a possible contracting triangle pattern, which is a bearish continuation setup in the context of a larger correction. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $106,600 convincingly, the structure could shift from a corrective triangle to a five-wave downward impulse. This would cause a deeper retracement, especially as the price is already forming lower highs within the triangle. As such, the longer Bitcoin lingers in this resistance range without a breakout, the higher the likelihood of a rapid downward move. Bearish And Bull Targets If Bitcoin were to confirm this breakdown, the analyst noted the first major target around the lower boundary of the support zone, which lies between $105,330 and $103,162. This zone is reinforced by the monthly pivot point and also overlaps with the cumulative long liquidation leverage region. The 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart further highlighted a potential short setup from the reversal zone near $107,100 and a projected target close to $104,300. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Further downside could pull the price toward the next support band around $102,600 or even down to $101,000, should liquidation pressure persist. Pejman, on the other hand, pointed out that a sustained breakout above the $107,120 resistance line could initiate a bullish reversal and push Bitcoin back towards the heavy resistance cluster above $108,000. A strong daily close above $108,000 could cancel the bearish outlook. However, failure to break above here could lead to a rejection and another downside move. Although Bitcoin is starting to show some signs of bullishness, its price action is still vulnerable to a quick pullback, especially if the tensions in the Middle East continue to unfold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,638, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. This subdued price action shows its current consolidation nature.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-etf-is-next-last-chance-to-buy-solaxy/",
      "summary": "Here\u2019s a list of the people who think a Solana ETF is incoming: everyone. And here\u2019s a list of the people who think a $SOL ETF could send Solana \u2013 and Solaxy, a much-needed Solana Layer 2 \u2013 sky-high: also everyone. That\u2019s right, Solana is gaining serious momentum. Cantor Fitzgerald&#8217;s analysts report that Solana-focused firms DeFi Development, Upexi, and SOL Strategies will raise each raise $250M this year for various crypto-related efforts, including $SOL treasuries. Both the pending $SOL ETFs and current treasury efforts underscore SOL&#8217;s strengths: a unified, low\u2011cost, and high\u2011throughput blockchain that enables native staking yields and positions it as an attractive treasury asset. And how does this impact side projects like Solaxy, Solana&#8217;s first-ever Layer-2 chain? Let&#8217;s discuss below. Solana\u2019s TVL Climbs as ETFs Loom Solana\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) now exceeds $8B, and it maintains a vibrant developer base. Today&#8217;s treasury strategies are shifting accordingly, favoring scalable, productive blockchains alongside traditional reserve assets like Bitcoin. Simultaneously, CoinShares joined other financial heavyweights in filing for a spot Solana ETF, featuring staking components and third-party custody via Coinbase and BitGo. The filing aims to address SEC concerns about redemption and staking. While there\u2019s no timeline on the SEC\u2019s response and potential approval, analysts anticipate potential approvals in late summer or early fall 2025. It\u2019s worth noting that CoinShares\u2019s filing was one of 8 on the same day for new $SOL ETFs. Why the rush? In part because Solana is enjoying steadily growing adoption, despite relatively lackluster $SOL price performance. Strategy\u2019s Treasury Strategy Expands to Solana As the drumbeat of Michael Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin strategy goes on, companies beyond (Micro)Strategy are joining the bandwagon. After all, who doesn\u2019t want their very own pile of crypto? And in this case, companies are applying it to $SOL as well. DeFi Development Corp notified the SEC back in April that it intended to sell $1B in securities to purchase $SOL. SOL Strategies, based in Canada, did the same in late May. What does this mean for investors? At least three possibilities: \u2b06\ufe0f SOL could be moving into the mainstream, attracting attention as a yield-generating asset thanks to its staking model and institutional embrace. \u2705 Approval of spot $SOL ETFs would dramatically lower barriers to $SOL exposure through traditional brokerage venues. \ud83d\udccaContinued technological adoption and treasury-level interest could propel SOL further, though regulatory black swans and market volatility remain risks. Solana stands at a pivotal junction, even as $SOL treasuries take off and Solana meme coins continue to get attention. And the core Solana technical advantages \u2013 low fees, fast transactions \u2013 will get supercharged as Solaxy wraps up a dynamite presale. Solaxy ($SOLX) \u2013 $54M Raised as Time Runs Out for Groundbreak Layer-2 Presale $53.9M raised in its official presale \u2013 but with interest still sky-high, Solaxy ($SOLX) has opened a six-day window for investors to join the action. Solana loyalists and meme coin enthusiasts, drawn by Solaxy\u2019s potential as the first-ever Solana Layer 2, have added another $2M after the presale ended on Monday. That potential is taking shape with the Testnet Block Explorer and Bridge already live. The full launch schedule kicks in with the Token Claim on June 23, then builds out with a Mainnet Launch and bridge connecting Solana, Ethereum, and Solaxy. Multichain functionality is built into Solaxy from launch, with full Layer 2 deployment as the crowning achievement of a red-hot crypto presale. With Solana interest peaking at just the right time, how far could Solaxy go? Our own price prediction shows the token could reach $0.032, up 1,700% from its current $0.001766. What is Solaxy? It\u2019s the future of an already dynamic blockchain, combining Solana\u2019s speed and low costs with Ethereum\u2019s rock-solid framework and incredible ability to scale. Learn how to buy Solaxy, but don\u2019t delay \u2013 this truly is the last chance to buy. Visit the Solaxy Presale Page. Solana Climbs Adoption Ladder \u2013 Will Solaxy Price Follow? Curiously, Solana\u2019s price seems to lag its adoption. Even as institutions flock to $SOL treasuries and ETFs, the token price lags far behind $BTC\u2019s impressive performance. Will Solaxy\u2019s Layer 2 send both $SOLX and $SOL surging? Do your own research. This isn\u2019t financial advice \u2013 crypto markets are always volatile."

      "summary": "According to Digital Ascension Group\u2019s Managing Director Jake Claver, XRP could reach a price level that brings a dramatic shift in how value moves on its network. He argues that higher token prices make the system more efficient. Claver even lays out a bold target of $10,000 per XRP, and he says that can happen within 24 months. The idea has reignited talk of crypto\u2019s next big rally. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Price And Liquidity Efficiency According to Claver, moving large sums on the XRP ledger depends on token price. At $1 per XRP, you need 1,000,000 tokens to shift $1 million. If the price rose to $10, only 100,000 tokens would do the job. And in a world where one XRP costs $1 million, a single token could cover that same $1 million transfer. This math shows why Claver believes price and network efficiency go hand in hand. Does XRP need to be a certain price to move large amounts of money? pic.twitter.com/tbqBbvST4y \u2014 Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 27, 2025 Market Cap Implications XRP trades near $2.24 today, with a market cap of about $131.7 billion. At $10,000 per token, that cap would swell to over $585 trillion. Claver treats that huge number as a sign of strength rather than a warning. He says market cap rules don\u2019t apply the same way to XRP. But critics point out you can\u2019t assume that every token sits ready to trade. Actual liquidity comes from orders on exchanges and funds in liquidity pools, not just a headline market cap. Timeline And Skepticism Claver doesn\u2019t shy away from timing. He told his followers that the $10,000 mark could arrive within 24 months. Some hear that as a call to buy now. Others see it as wildly optimistic. To reach that level, XRP would need to climb more than 500,000% from today\u2019s price. Even Bitcoin, with far more adoption, took about four years to go from $1,200 to $68,000 in the last cycle. Cranking out a similar or bigger gain in half the time would require huge new demand. Community Reaction And Risks Based on reports, Claver\u2019s claim has attracted both cheers and jeers. Some XRP fans embrace the vision. Others worry it sets unrealistic hopes. Alex Caraco, former CEO of an Australian stock market firm, summed up a common view: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see buyers sold the story of $10,000 XRP happening tomorrow.\u201d Critics say such talk distracts from real issues like regulatory hurdles, exchange listings and developer growth.

Current indicators paint a neutral market mood, with the Fear &#38; Greed Index leaning heavily toward Neutral at a score of 57.

      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s Market-Value-to-Realised-Value (MVRV) Z-Score is printing just 0.28 \u2013 a level normally associated with capitulation, not euphoria. Yet the price of the ninth-largest cryptocurrency keeps carving a succession of higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart, trading near $0.17 with a market capitalisation of roughly $26 billion in Monday\u2019s late-New-York session. The juxtaposition between lethargic on-chain sentiment and resilient spot bids was laid bare in a chart posted to X by Kevin, the pseudonymous analyst behind @Kev_Capital_TA. \u201cDogecoin MVRV Score is still at bear-market levels while price continues to make higher highs and higher lows on higher time frames,\u201d he wrote. Kevin also pointed out that previous cycle tops saw the Z-Score blow off at \u224811 in 2017 and \u224816 in 2021, whereas the current advance has so far peaked at 3.5. \u201c#DOGE \u2026 has not seen a real bull run yet. This delay in durable Altcoins out-performance is very much due to restrictive monetary policy\u2026 It will change at some point and Alts will have their day in the sun.\u201d The Macro Backdrop For Dogecoin The \u201crestrictive monetary policy\u201d Kevin cites remains the single most important head-wind for the entire alt-coin complex. In the US, the Federal Reserve has held the fed-funds target at 4.25 %\u20134.50% since January, having already delivered three cuts in 2024. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level\u2014Or Risk A 30% Price Crash Futures markets this week imply the first additional reduction \u201caround September or later,\u201dafter soft May inflation but a still-solid economy At the same time the Fed is only slowing \u2014 not stopping \u2014 quantitative tightening: beginning 1 April the monthly Treasury run-off cap fell to $5 billion from $25 billion, but Chair Jerome Powell made clear \u201cthere is no sign yet the Fed is ready to end QT.\u201d In Europe, the ECB has started to nudge borrowing costs lower, slicing the deposit rate to 2% on 5 June. President Christine Lagarde nevertheless insisted the Governing Council was \u201cin a good position\u201d to move gradually and would keep quantitative easing \u201cin the toolbox,\u201d rather than redeploying it. Vice-President Luis de Guindos was more explicit yesterday, telling Reuters that the ECB had \u201clearned much more about side effects\u201d of money printing and that the bar for new QE is now \u201chigher.\u201d The net result is a world in which policy rates are still comfortably above neutral, liquidity is being drained by the Fed, and European officials are determined not to repeat the 2015-21 experiment of perpetual bond-buying. In Kevin\u2019s words, this \u201cdelay\u201d in easy money explains why alt-coins have under-performed Bitcoin so far in the 2024-25 cycle. Reading The MVRV Tea Leaves MVRV compares the aggregate market value of all coins with the value at which they last moved on-chain (their realised value). A Z-Score normalises that ratio against its own multi-year mean and standard deviation. Historically for Dogecoin, values above +9 have coincided with secular tops (January 2018; May 2021), values between \u20131 and +1 have appeared during long lateral \u201ccrypto winters,\u201d and values below \u20131 have signalled deep capitulation and, in hindsight, exceptional long-term entry points. Related Reading: $8 Dogecoin? Analyst Says You\u2019ll Regret Sleeping On This Chart Today\u2019s 0.28 sits squarely inside the winter band even though spot DOGE is up roughly 5x from its 2022 lows. The same disparity is visible within the chart: the blue line (market cap) has been rising since late 2023, while the red Z-Score remains pinned near zero because the orange line (realised cap) is climbing almost in lock-step as dormant supply changes hands at higher cost basis. In plain English, the average on-chain holder is not yet sitting on the kind of paper profits that breed euphoria. When Could Policy Turn From Restrictive To Supportive? Futures markets now look for two quarter-point Fed cuts by December, taking policy to roughly 3.75%. Market-implied odds of a September move fluctuate with each inflation print; should shelter and services dis-inflation stall, traders will push expectations into 2026. However, neither the Fed nor the ECB is openly contemplating new asset purchases. Powell told reporters in March that the slower pace of QT is designed to \u201cextend how far the central bank can run QT before needing to stop,\u201d not to hint at a reversal. In Frankfurt, de Guindos stressed that \u201csometimes it\u2019s much easier to start using [QE] than to withdraw it,\u201d signalling that any relaunch would require either a financial-stability shock or a deep recession. With QT still active and rate-cut trajectories shallow, a powerful systemic tail-wind for DOGE may not materialise until after the first Fed or ECB pause in balance-sheet contraction. If consensus is correct that QT ends late-2025 or early-2026, any prospective QE would be a story for the next downturn, not this upswing. Kevin\u2019s interpretation hinges on potential energy. Because the Z-Score has not yet detached from its mean, Dogecoin can, in theory, absorb a fresh wave of retail and leverage-driven inflows without immediately flashing the kind of overheated signal that coaxed sellers in 2017 and 2021. Put differently, DOGE\u2019s spring has not been compressed. Macro, however, remains the gating factor. \u201cBuy them low and sell them high. Never get attached to your Alts,\u201d the analyst reminds followers. For now, low MVRV suggests structural downside is limited, but cyclicality implies explosive upside will likely coincide with a convincing turn in global liquidity \u2013 a turn that the Fed and the ECB, by their own admission, are not yet ready to deliver. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17387. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a \u201cslow-motion downtrend,\u201d with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gold Rush 2.0? Treasuries Swell With 60 New Players The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or \u201cgreen candles\u201d are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows\u2014such as fresh stimulus or significant investment\u2014the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak? Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso\u2019s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025.

With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.
