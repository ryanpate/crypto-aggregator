      "summary": "Bitcoin has reached new milestones this week, briefly breaking above the $123,000 mark earlier today before retracing slightly to $121,812 at the time of writing. This follows a week of strong gains, with BTC rising by more than 10% amid a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the minor pullback, market analysts are closely monitoring on-chain and derivatives data to assess whether momentum is building toward a more aggressive phase of the rally. The recent surge has also benefited the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, lifting total global crypto market capitalization to just under $4 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes While Bitcoin continues to dominate in terms of volume and influence, sentiment metrics suggest that traders and investors may still be approaching with measured optimism. According to analysts, several indicators are now pointing to a potential shift in market dynamics that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s next major move. Market Euphoria Not Yet Confirmed CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson has offered insights into the current structure of the Bitcoin market through an analysis of the price gap between spot and perpetual futures contracts on Binance. In a recent QuickTake post, Wedson noted that the spot price of Bitcoin continues to outpace the perpetual futures price, a sign that market sentiment has not yet tipped into full euphoria. Historically, a positive gap between the two markets has signaled increased speculative activity and the onset of parabolic rallies. &#8220;The gap is still in negative territory,&#8221; Wedson stated, \u201cbut the narrowing trend indicates that sentiment may be transitioning from cautious to more optimistic.&#8221; The analysis implies that traders in the futures market have yet to aggressively price in further upside, possibly waiting for stronger confirmation before deploying leverage. Should this gap flip to positive territory, it could be interpreted as a sign of increased risk appetite, potentially fueling a sharper upward move. Wedson also emphasized the importance of monitoring how derivatives markets respond in the coming days. \u201cIf the trend continues and flips positive, we could see a more intense phase of the rally driven by leveraged traders,\u201d he wrote. Until then, the current environment appears to reflect a market in the process of building a foundation, rather than one that has already entered a euphoric phase. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Measured In another analysis, CryptoQuant\u2019s Enigma Trader examined the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key indicator used to evaluate the extent of realized profits by Bitcoin holders.

      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) has reignited market excitement after smashing through the $123,000 level. Currently, technical indicators, surging liquidity, and macroeconomic tailwinds have analysts predicting that the leading cryptocurrency is on the verge of a parabolic surge to a $140,000 top in the next few weeks. $140,000 Set As Bitcoin Next Top Target The Bitcoin price is exhibiting remarkable strength as it continues its parabolic advance beyond the $123,000 range. Technical indicators identified by crypto analyst Mr. Wall Street are now aligning around a new short-term target between $135,000 and $140,000. Related Reading: Here\u2019s Why The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Are Surging Today According to the market expert\u2019s chart report, BTC has successfully broken out of a Broadening Wedge pattern after consolidating between a descending support and horizontal resistance for nearly two months. The decisive breakout above the $112,000 resistance validates the analyst\u2019s earlier bullish projections. Initially, the analyst proposed two possible scenarios: A breakout above all-time highs around $112,000 leading directly to a $117,000-$120,000 rally or a brief dip to $92,000 to fill the CME gap before continuing up toward the same target zone. Based on its recent price movement, Bitcoin has chosen to follow the first scenario, underscoring the strength of its bullish momentum and signaling that short-term Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) has had little to no effect. With the second scenario officially invalidated, BTC\u2019s price trajectory is seemingly clearer and higher. The recent surge above $123,000 has also spotlighted the next major liquidity pool between $135,000 and $140,000. The chart highlights that reaching this zone would liquidate over $45 billion in short positions. Following this, the next target zone sits between $160,000 and $170,000, threatening another $70 billion in short liquidations. M2 Surge And MACD Fuel BTC\u2019s Bullish Case Mr. Wall Street\u2019s bullish setup for Bitcoin is further supported by macroeconomic and key chart indicators. The analyst pointed to US President Donald Trump\u2019s recent approval of a bill to raise the country\u2019s debt ceiling\u2014a move that signals accelerating debt growth. This, in turn, is expected to expand M2 money supply, which historically correlates with rising prices for assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here\u2019s The Target BTC\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also remains fully intact across all time frames, while the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is still well below historic top levels. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has yet to enter overbought territory. These indicators confirm that Bitcoin is still far from a macro top, making the $135,000 &#8211; $140,000 range a plausible interim target. Looking ahead, Mr. Wall Street emphasizes that Bitcoin has entered a supercycle, a phase where the market is marked by price discovery. While he acknowledges the possibility of a short-term retest of the $112,000 level before continuing upward, the analyst maintains that, regardless of minor pullbacks, the price action from here is likely to be swift and aggressive.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Investing Broz has spotlighted Cardano (ADA) as one of the most promising altcoins currently breaking out amid a shifting macro landscape and rising Bitcoin valuations. In his latest video update, the analyst identified ADA\u2019s recent technical breakout as a clear sign of bullish momentum, forecasting a price target of $1.90 in the coming weeks if momentum holds. Cardano Bull Run Is Back On Investing Broz began the segment by reiterating the broader context: Bitcoin\u2019s explosive rally above the $120,000 mark has reignited speculation around the arrival of altseason. \u201cThis is just one more egg in the basket of potentially altcoin season coming very soon,\u201d he noted, citing Bitcoin dominance breaking below a critical support level and altcoins \u201cgoing berserk.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano Price Explodes 30% In Past Week \u2014 Analyst Calls $5 Next Market Top Among the altcoins leading the charge, Cardano stood out. The analyst confirmed that he purchased ADA in the past 24 hours, identifying the move as more than just opportunistic. The trigger? A confirmed breakout above a long-standing resistance level that ADA hadn\u2019t pierced since March 1. \u201cThis is a major win for Cardano holders who are trading it,\u201d he said, explaining that a falling wedge pattern had been developing for weeks and now signaled a shift in trend. Investing Broz\u2019s trading group had initially positioned long at $0.54, with a modest target of $0.80. But as he emphasized, \u201cCardano is not just breaking above the smaller resistance level\u2014we\u2019re breaking above a resistance level we haven\u2019t been back above since March.\u201d That March breakout, he reminded viewers, was spurred by a now-infamous Donald Trump tweet listing altcoins deemed suitable for a proposed American crypto reserve. While that spike proved short-lived, the current breakout is, in his view, fundamentally and technically sound. To calculate a realistic upside scenario, he applied the traditional breakout target technique by measuring the height of the formation and projecting it forward. \u201cThis would give you a Cardano price prediction of $1.90,\u201d he stated, while also noting that such a target might be ambitious for a summer timeframe. Still, \u201cit\u2019s absolutely doable and definitely something you guys should be keeping an eye on.\u201d Related Reading: The Last Time This Happened Cardano Rose 55%, ADA Analyst Makes Bold The analyst reinforced his bullish outlook using confirmation from the LuxAlgo indicator suite, which flashed a weekly buy signal\u2014featuring a green reversal, bullish momentum, and positive money flow. Based on this, he offered a more immediate price range between $1.00 and $1.80. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to stop at $1.80, but I think it\u2019s a target to keep an eye on if you\u2019re looking for a trade,\u201d he said. Beyond that, a golden pocket Fibonacci extension points to a key level of $2.42 by year\u2019s end. However, Investing Broz was quick to clarify that these are not his full-cycle targets for ADA. \u201cThis is not my long-term bullish price prediction for this bull market,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cThis is simply tradable movements that I still think can happen over the next couple of weeks.\u201d His earlier predictions suggested ADA could hit $7 to $10 by the cycle top\u2014possibly extending into 2026 or even 2027. Throughout the segment, he stressed the importance of knowing when to take profit. \u201cEvery bull market has volatility. Cardano\u2026 is going to have volatile movements where they rally and then pull back,\u201d he advised. For short-term traders, targets around $1.80 to $2.40 may present ideal levels to secure gains or even explore short positions if momentum wanes. While ADA is not the only altcoin the analyst is tracking\u2014Ono and HAR were also highlighted for similar breakout behavior\u2014Cardano\u2019s confluence of technical strength, historical resistance flip, and volume surge make it a standout in the current environment. As the analyst concluded, \u201cThere\u2019s still time\u2026 this is a major breakout, and if you\u2019re a trader, this is what you wait for.\u201d Cardano, for now, has flashed its signal. Whether it makes good on the $1.90 target may depend not only on its own momentum, but on the broader timing of altseason\u2019s long-awaited arrival. At press time, ADA stood at $0.7447.

However, the potential upper targets have also moved higher, and might open the door to unprecedented price levels in the weeks ahead. Why The Bull Market Delay Might Be Good News Global uncertainties have delayed the second and possibly final phase of the current bull market in cryptocurrencies. According to master kenobi&#8217;s post on X, he noted that these delays may end up working in our favor. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO While Bitcoin and altcoins have remained within the boundaries of an ascending trend channel, the upper and lower limits of this channel are steadily rising, and showing resilience in market structure despite the external hesitation. If the second phase of the bull market ignited in April, projections suggest that the BTC upper limit might have topped out between $134,000 and $155,000. However, as this didn\u2019t happen, the upper limit has continued to climb, and if the 50-day pump pattern holds, the upper limit could be reached around August 11, at a range of $169,000 and $197,000. Naturally, this requires relative global stability. &#8220;Let\u2019s hope for another 30 days of calm, as 20 days have already passed,&#8221; the analyst added. Why Bitcoin Surge Is A Market-Wide Trigger In an X post, Davie Satoshi also mentioned that Bitcoin is on the verge of something big, that BTC is hovering in the middle of a multi-year bullish channel. It has been marked by long-standing green trendlines, and has just broken through the resistance level, which is indicated by a blue dotted horizontal line that has capped upside momentum until now.

The analyst stated that a rising tide lifts all boats, and that Bitcoin has always been the bellwether of the crypto market. They also suggest that BTC price could surge toward $180,000 to $200,000, with a potential top forming around late August to September, which will be followed by alt season and peaking in Q4 2025 to Q1 2026. The memecoins and altcoins continue to dominate the narrative in the crypto space this year.

This came as the analyst noted that the altcoin is already on the move, having recorded a 20% gain since its breakout. XRP Train Already On The Move To ATHs In an X post, Captain Faibik stated that the XRP train has already departed, with a rally to all-time highs on the horizon. The analyst noted that the altcoin has already surged over 20% since its breakout above $2.3. He had earlier predicted that the token was on the verge of a breakout, which would send it above its current ATH of $3.84. Related Reading: XRP Wave 3 Could Repeat 600% Surge From Nov 2025, Target Set For $15 Captain Faibik remarked that this bullish rally will send XRP to as high as $4.60. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto also indicated that a new ATH is in sight for the altcoin. In an X post, He stated that XRP needs to close the $3-day candle above the top wick of the March 2nd candle. The analyst told market participants to get ready for a new ATH if it closes above the $3.010 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also echoed Captain Faibik\u2019s sentiments, stating that XRP has just recorded a powerful breakout. He noted that the altcoin has confirmed a clean breakout from the multi-month descending triangle and revealed that the target is $3.80. This brings XRP to its ATH, which could pave the way for new highs. XRP boasts a bullish outlook, given its breakout from the crucial $2.30 support level that Captain Faibik and Titan of Crypto highlighted. The altcoin is now looking to reclaim the psychological $3 level, which would bring it close to its yearly high of $3.29. Momentum Is Off The Charts In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades declared that XRP\u2019s momentum is off the charts. She noted that Relative Strength Index (RSI) divergences are being \u201cobliterated\u201d as bulls remain in full control. Based on this, the analyst predicts that the altcoin is likely entering the most powerful part of the wave, completing Wave 3 of 3.

Her accompanying chart showed that a clean break above this Fib level could send XRP to $3.4, which is the next major resistance after $3.04. A rally to this level would put its ATH well in sight.
