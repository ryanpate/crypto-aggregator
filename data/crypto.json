      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoins-liquidity-lifeline-just-got-cut/",
      "summary": "The liquidity engine that has supported risk assets, including Bitcoin, since the beginning of 2025 is now shifting into reverse. According to macro analyst Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets), the six-month upswing in Federal Reserve liquidity has ended, and a potentially destabilizing wave of debt issuance by the US Treasury is about to begin. In a post published on X late Sunday, Tomas warned: \u201c Federal Reserve Liquidity set to fall\u2026 The Fed liquidity upswing that began on January 1 2025 is now over.\u201d Bitcoin Enters Danger Zone The catalyst behind this reversal is the recent $5 trillion debt ceiling increase passed by Congress last week. That legislative decision gives the Treasury Department the green light to aggressively rebuild its cash balance at the Federal Reserve\u2014known as the Treasury General Account (TGA)\u2014which had been intentionally drained to inject liquidity into the system during the first half of the year. \u201cThe US Government had previously been draining the Treasury General Account (liquidity injection). But a new debt ceiling agreement was reached last week ($5 trillion raise). This means the Government will start to flood the market with new debt to \u2018refill\u2019 the TGA (liquidity drain),\u201d Tomas wrote. He emphasized that the refill target is currently set at $850 billion, up from recent levels around $350 billion, implying roughly $500 billion in liquidity will be removed from the system in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To \u2018Very Bullish\u2019 \u2014 What This Means The implications for Bitcoin are stark. Risk assets have historically benefited from rising dollar liquidity\u2014particularly in the context of elevated ETF inflows, corporate adoption, and a weakening US dollar. But that backdrop is now shifting. As Tomas put it, \u201cAll else being equal, this TGA rebuild process should be bullish for the US dollar.\u201d A strengthening dollar, when coupled with falling bank reserves, is generally a bearish environment for Bitcoin. The pressure on liquidity won\u2019t necessarily come all at once, but the mechanics are clear. Treasury will issue large volumes of new short-term debt\u2014primarily T-bills\u2014to finance the TGA refill. This issuance will compete with other dollar-denominated assets for funding, draining cash out of banks and money markets. Tomas notes that this dynamic could be softened if money market funds rotate their cash out of the Fed\u2019s Overnight Reverse Repo Facility, which still holds about $214 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could lower the target level, meaning less of a refill,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019d expect we may see a lot of T-bill issuance, which could tempt some of the remaining $214bn left in the Reverse Repo to leave the facility (liquidity injection) and lessen any negative impact of the TGA refill.\u201d Still, even with some reallocation from RRP, Tomas expects the overall effect to reduce reserve balances\u2014bank reserves as a percentage of GDP are likely to fall below 10%, he estimates. While this is not as dire as the 7% level reached in 2019 (which triggered the repo crisis), it represents a sharp tightening compared to the first half of this year. \u201cThere could be some funding stress around the end of September (end-of-quarter),\u201d Tomas cautioned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap\u2014Analyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge Bitcoin\u2019s performance has coincided with the exact window Tomas outlines as a liquidity upswing. As documented, Bitcoin\u2019s price has closely tracked the direction of aggregate G5 central bank balance sheets and the level of US bank reserves. When those reserves shrink\u2014especially in the face of stronger Treasury issuance and a rebounding dollar\u2014Bitcoin has historically struggled to sustain upside momentum. This concern is compounded by Tomas\u2019s warning that speculative short positioning against the dollar has reached extremes. \u201cBack in January, I was shouting about a fall in the dollar. Now everybody and their mothers are bearish on the dollar, and positioning is massively short across the board. It\u2019s time for, at the very least, an upward correction/consolidation for the US dollar, in my opinion.\u201d Such a reversal in the dollar would mark a critical macro headwind for Bitcoin. The 90-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin and the US Dollar Index (DXY) remains firmly negative. In environments where the dollar strengthens\u2014especially when driven by tightening liquidity\u2014Bitcoin has rarely outperformed. The next several weeks will be critical. If Treasury proceeds with aggressive issuance and market participants demand higher yields, liquidity could tighten faster than anticipated. While Tomas does leave open the possibility that Secretary Bessent may adjust the TGA target downward, the baseline scenario remains a $500 billion net liquidity drain\u2014directly reversing the conditions that allowed Bitcoin to surge. At press time, BTC traded at $108,148. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-range-tightens-liquidity-looms-at-2800-and-2350/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is approaching a pivotal moment as it pushes to reclaim the $2,600 level, aiming to break free from weeks of sideways action. After trading within a tight range since early May, ETH is now testing the upper boundary of its consolidation zone, a move that could mark the start of a new bullish phase for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low \u2013 Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Market participants are closely watching this level, as a successful breakout above $2,600 would likely attract momentum buyers and confirm renewed strength across the altcoin sector. However, the breakout is far from guaranteed. If bulls fail to sustain this move, Ethereum could face renewed selling pressure, with price potentially revisiting lower support zones. According to Coinglass data, liquidity clusters are clearly defined at $2,800 and $2,350. These levels will likely act as magnets in the coming days, depending on how Ethereum responds to current resistance. A clean break toward $2,800 would confirm bullish intent and broader altcoin surges, while a rejection could reinforce bearish sentiment. Ethereum&#8217;s Next Move Could Ignite Altseason Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but bullish momentum is quietly building. Ethereum, the leader of the altcoin market, has been consolidating in a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. This prolonged sideways action has kept much of the altcoin sector in a state of indecision. Now, traders and analysts agree: Ethereum must break out to lead the next major move. Market analyst Ted Pillows identifies two key liquidity levels for ETH: $2,800 on the upside and $2,350 on the downside. These zones represent the most likely destinations for price in the short term, depending on which side of the range breaks first. If Ethereum pushes above $2,800 with strength, it would likely trigger renewed risk appetite and a broad-based altcoin rally. On the other hand, a breakdown below $2,350 could lead to deeper corrections across the board. So far, bulls have defended the $2,500 level well, and growing open interest suggests that investors are positioning for an expansion. A decisive breakout in either direction will resolve weeks of consolidation and determine the short-term trend. Until then, Ethereum remains the gatekeeper of altcoin momentum\u2014its next move could define the path for the entire market. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low \u2013 Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Resistance Amid Range-Bound Structure Ethereum is currently trading at $2,563, hovering just below the $2,600 mark, a level that has acted as short-term resistance throughout June and early July. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has been trapped in a horizontal consolidation structure between $2,400 and $2,700, with multiple failed attempts to break either side convincingly. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs), which is a positive signal for bulls. The 100 SMA at $2,532 and the 200 SMA at $2,206 have offered strong dynamic support during recent pullbacks, reinforcing the current uptrend structure. Volume remains moderate, suggesting that market participants are waiting for a clear breakout before entering with conviction. A decisive close above $2,600 would open the door for a move toward $2,800, where large liquidity clusters have been identified by Coinglass. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook However, failure to maintain this short-term momentum could push ETH back toward the $2,400 support zone. Bulls have defended this level several times, and a break below it would likely invalidate the bullish setup and increase the risk of a deeper correction.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-repeat-parabolic-phase/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is currently on the path to holding a strong footing above $109,000 after reclaiming the $108,000 price level in the past seven days. Notably, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has gained more than $3,000 over the past week, with bullish momentum building steadily across the broader crypto market. Bitcoin is once again flirting with all-time highs, and popular crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader recently shared a technical analysis on social media that claims Bitcoin has now entered its third parabolic phase. His chart places Bitcoin right on track for another historic climb to crazy price targets even in 2025. Bitcoin Following Familiar Price Schedule According to Merlijn\u2019s analysis, Bitcoin\u2019s current market structure is mimicking its past two parabolic rallies that took place in 2017 and 2021. Just like in previous cycles, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price cycle has moved through a prolonged consolidation phase and gradually grinded upward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline The next thing now is a vertical breakout. A weekly chart that followed his post on the social media platform X highlighted this trend with three red bowl-shaped curves, each leading into a green \u201cParabolic Phase\u201d box that represents the final leg of each bull run. The price action so far in 2024 and 2025 has continued to trace this same path. The curve that began forming after the 2022 bottom is now tilting upward sharply. Interestingly, Bitcoin bounced cleanly off the lower arc during its April crash to $74,000, just as it did in 2016 and 2020 before launching into new all-time highs. Crypto analyst Merlijn believes this rebound is the strongest indication yet that the final breakout phase is approaching. No Second Chances: Here&#8217;s The Price Target According to the analyst, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price structure on the weekly chart has never failed in previous cycles. However, anyone waiting on the sidelines may miss the move entirely. \u201cBitcoin bounced off the parabolic curve support, momentum is building, and if history rhymes with the biggest burst of the move, this parabolic phase does not give second chances,\u201d he explained. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes History With Highest Monthly Close, But Volume Is Still Bearish The most interesting part of Merlijn\u2019s forecast is the price target itself. Based on the chart he shared, the green parabolic zone for 2025 extends as high as $335,000, representing more than a 205% rally from current levels. The mid-region of the box is around $150,000, making even the conservative price target significantly higher than Bitcoin\u2019s current price. This prediction is based on the magnitude of previous parabolic runs, which saw Bitcoin increase by over 2,000% in 2017 and more than 1,300% from its 2020 lows to its 2021 peak. If the third phase delivers a similar rally, the path to $335,000 may not be far-fetched. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,850, having reached an intraday high of $109,574.

      "title": "Ethereum Breaks Higher With Conviction: No Signs Of A Breakdown Yet",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-breaks-higher/",
      "summary": "Bankr, in a recent update, pointed out that Ethereum is maintaining its upward momentum, backed by solid volume and a more favorable news environment. Although brief spikes in volatility may arise from macroeconomic events, Bankr believes the broader trend remains intact, as long as $2,510 holds. Ethereum Three-Day Price Trend Action Analyzing price action over the last 72 hours, Bankr noted a gently rising three-day trend. ETH started near $2,535, spiked to $2,598, and is now holding around $2,571 \u2014 a gain of roughly +1.5% for the period. The strongest push came Sunday night when ETH jumped $50 in one hour on the heaviest volume of the week. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gathers Strength \u2014 Bulls Prepare for Upside Extension Since then, the price has been consolidating in a tight $2,565\u2013$2,585 range. On the candle side, higher lows are visible at $2,506, $2,512, $2,540, and $2,560, which shows buyers are stepping in a little earlier on each dip. Examining simple indicators, Bankr noted that the 20-hour moving average is approximately $2,565, with the price sitting just above it \u2014 a mildly positive sign. The 50-hour moving average is around $2,538 and still shows a sloping upward trend bias, while candles stay above $2,540. For momentum, a quick RSI-style check shows ETH touched overbought during the $2,598 spike, then cooled to neutral (50\u201355), which leaves room for another leg higher. As for key levels, Bankr outlined support at $2,550 (recent pivot), $2,510 (volume shelf), and $2,480 (weekly floor). On the resistance side, levels to watch include $2,590\u2013$2,600 (last high) and $2,625 (March swing high). News Impact And Game Plan While Ethereum surges, a stronger-than-expected US jobs report typically acts as a headwind, since it implies the Fed will likely stay on hold. However, Bankr noted that crypto appears to be shrugging it off, thanks to a solid risk appetite that&#8217;s keeping momentum intact despite the macro pressure. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup \u2013 Here\u2019s Why BTC Holds The Key On the political front, Bankr highlighted that next week\u2019s US \u201cCrypto Week\u201d in Congress, combined with the administration\u2019s pro-crypto stance, is lifting sentiment. Traders are now positioning ahead of potential developments, including clearer regulatory direction and ETH-related ETF chatter, both of which are helping boost confidence. In terms of sector dynamics, Bankr pointed to ongoing institutional accumulation from players like Metaplanet. Additionally, Bankr mentioned the recent USDC burn, which reflects responsible supply management and supports a more constructive backdrop for Ethereum. Outlining a flexible approach, Bankr points to the accumulation of dips, placing laddered limit buys at $2,555, $2,535, and $2,505 in case of a sharp shakeout. For a breakout trade, if ETH closes an hourly candle above $2,600, look to enter or add with a short-term target at $2,625\u2013$2,650, and place a stop just under $2,580. As a protective exit, if ETH drifts below $2,510 on rising volume, momentum likely shifts, cutting exposure or using a stop around $2,495 can help limit drawdowns. For profit-taking, Bankr suggests trimming partial positions at $2,590 and again near $2,625, while leaving a runner in case a summer rally extends toward $2,700.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/400m-crypto-seizure-by-secret-service-highlights-why-cold-storage-and-best-wallet-are-essential/",
      "summary": "The U.S. Secret Service has now seized over $400M in digital assets, all of which are stored in a single cold wallet, making it one of the largest cold wallet crypto stashes around. It\u2019s worth noting that these assets have been recovered over a period of 10 years by tracking and neutralizing online cryptocurrency scams. Global crypto scams totaled around $16.6B in 2024 alone, with Americans losing a chunky $9.3B. Out of this, older adults were hit the hardest, losing nearly $2.8B. Read on as we dig into how these scams are executed and how the Secret Service works to neutralize them. We\u2019ll also explain why using a secure, non-custodial crypto wallet like Best Wallet (powered by $BEST) is absolutely critical to keeping your crypto safe. How Are Cryptocurrency Scams Neutralized? Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the U.S. Secret Service, shed light on how these scams operate and how they neutralize them. In one instance, scammers used photos of attractive individuals to lure unsuspecting investors into seemingly legitimate cryptocurrency websites, often complete with sleek design and dedicated support teams to build trust. Initial deposits would yield small profits, which encouraged the victims to keep investing. Eventually, the platform would stop working, and the account balance would disappear into thin air. Jamie\u2019s team traced the fake investment site\u2019s domain using open source tools to uncover details like registration time and ownership. When they tracked the domain purchase, it led them to a crypto wallet, and a brief VPN failure finally helped expose the scammer\u2019s IP address. A large part of these takedowns also depends on cooperation from industry players like Tether and Coinbase. In fact, Tether helped the Secret Service recover $225M worth of $USDT in what was one of the largest crypto scam busts to date. All of this underscores the importance of using a secure crypto storage solution like Best Wallet. By giving you total control of your assets and keeping them safe from phishing and fraud, Best Wallet ensures you don\u2019t fall prey to a crypto hack. What is Best Wallet? As mentioned above, Best Wallet is a free crypto wallet that&#8217;s completely self-custodial. This simply means that you and only you will have access to your wallet\u2019s private keys, ensuring that no third party, not even Best Wallet&#8217;s employees, can access your wallet or the funds therein. Along with this, Best Wallet also comes with excellent 2FA/MFA options, allowing you to set up a second one-time password for access to your account. Here, you have the option to use biometric authentication, which is one of the safest and most sought-after 2FA measures. What&#8217;s more, Best Wallet leverages advanced cryptographic technology to protect you and your stored crypto against theft, hacks, and other malicious crypto attacks, including scams and phishing attempts. Even better, Best Wallet employees verify every token before making it available on their platform, safeguarding you from investing your hard-earned money into scam tokens. That&#8217;s not all, though, as Best Wallet has some exciting upgrades in store. It&#8217;ll soon roll out advanced anti-fraud protection and defenses against sophisticated MEV (Miner Extractable Value) attacks. More Than Just Security: Best Wallet Supercharges Meme Coin Access and Trading One of the most unique features of Best Wallet is that it allows you to buy new meme coins on presale directly from within the app. Usually, even the best crypto wallets will require you to connect to a presale&#8217;s website and complete your purchase from there. However, Best Wallet&#8217;s \u2018Upcoming\u2019 section redefines what simplicity means in the meme coin space by allowing users to buy new meme coins without ever having to leave the app. Furthermore, Best Wallet also plans on offering a full-fledged crypto trading terminal, with limit buy/sell orders, stop-losses, and even dollar cost averaging (DCA). Buy $BEST and Join Best Wallet&#8217;s Success Story With a streamlined approach to meme coin purchases, intuitive mobile-first design, and top-notch security, Best Wallet has everything it needs to achieve its goal of capturing over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027. You can ride this success story by buying Best Wallet Token ($BEST), the project&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. It&#8217;s currently in presale, with over $13.7M already raised, and each token available at a low price of $0.025295. According to our $BEST price prediction, the token can surge around 180% and reach $0.07 by 2030, offering early buyers a chunky return on their investment. Most importantly, $BEST holders get to unlock a slew of ecosystem benefits. These include reduced trading and gas fees, governance rights, staking rewards (currently yielding 100%), and early access to new meme coin launches. To learn more about Best Wallet, check out its official whitepaper. And for all of the latest updates, follow it on X and join its Telegram channel.
