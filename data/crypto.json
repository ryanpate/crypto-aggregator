      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-will-reach-20-30/",
      "summary": "Crypto expert XForceGlobal has issued a new bullish forecast for the XRP price, predicting that the third-largest cryptocurrency is gearing up for its biggest rally yet. With the Elliott Wave Theory as the key indicator for this move, the analyst believes that XRP could soon see a potential surge between $20 and $30 this bull cycle. XRP Price Forecasted To Rise To $27 In his video analysis posted on X social media, XForceGlobal predicted that XRP is on the cusp of an explosive breakout to $27. The market expert began his analysis by highlighting that XRP\u2019s volatility has crashed to rock bottom, marking the first time in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history that it has reached such levels. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted 600% XRP Price Rally In 2024 Says Next Leg Up Will Be \u2018Parabolic\u2019 Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading close to all-time highs and has been moving within a tight range between $1.5 and $3.8 for six months. XForceGlobal calls this trade range an \u201cunprecedented price action,\u201d which XRP has never experienced on the macro level. XForceGlobal also noted that XRP\u2019s persistent range-bound trading is likely due to investors refusing to sell off their tokens. He revealed that nearly all momentum indicators are aligning in favor of a move toward new all-time highs. More importantly, signals from the Elliott Wave Theory support that XRP may be on the verge of a powerful breakout soon. Using this theory, XForceGlobal explains that XRP is currently entering Wave 3 after experiencing a five-wave move that triggered a surge from $0.37 to above $2.4, followed by a three-wave correction toward $1.5. The analyst explained that within the Elliott Wave Theory, Wave 3 is typically the strongest and longest wave. As a result, he predicts that the XRP price is likely going to hit an initial target around $16.3 soon, making it significantly more profitable than the historic December breakout, when the cryptocurrency surged from its long-held $0.5 range to above $2. Following the completion of Wave 3, XForceGlobal predicts that XRP will possibly experience a crash toward $6 in Wave 4. After this correction, the cryptocurrency is expected to begin forming Wave 5, which is where its price is projected to skyrocket toward $27. XRP Alternative Bullish Case During his video analysis, XForceGlobal suggested that while XRP could potentially surge to between $20 and $30 in Wave 5, this outcome isn\u2019t guaranteed. If it does not play out, the alternative scenario involves a much longer corrective phase within a flat structure. This is anticipated to be followed by a potential breakout above $4 in Wave 3 before a much powerful rally into the double-digit territory. Related Reading: XRP\u2019s 30% Jump To $2.8: Analyst Says This \u2018Classic Confirmation\u2019 Must Happen First He predicts that once XRP climbs above $4, it could undergo a sharp correction down to $1.56, representing wave c of the five-wave impulse move. Notably, XForceGlobal admitted that it is still challenging to determine which of the two bullish scenarios is more likely to unfold at this time. However, the analyst emphasizes that regardless of which scenario unfolds, XRP will still be aiming for the upside and retesting the $4 level.

      "summary": "Stellar Lumens hit a critical support level this week at $0.20, putting the token in a precarious spot. At that price, XLM sits 30% below its peak in May and 60% under its 2024 high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details Based on reports, bears have been piling on, pushing the funding rate into negative territory since early June. If that support gives way, traders warn XLM could slide toward $0.15, a drop of about 35%. Network Activity Up According to Artemis, operations on the Stellar network surged to 197 million in June. Stablecoin supply also reached a record $667 million. Over the past five months, the total value locked in real\u2011world asset tokenization grew to $487 million, helped by new offerings such as the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Market Fund. Those figures suggest healthy demand for on\u2011chain services and asset tokenization inside Stellar\u2019s ecosystem. Funding Rates Down Funding rates in perpetual futures have been negative most days since May. That means more short positions than long ones, with short traders paying long traders to keep their bets in place. XLM\u2019s funding rate hit its lowest point since June 30, pointing to rising bearish sentiment. When funding rates stay deep in the red, it often adds selling pressure as traders brace for steeper losses. The image above shows that XLM funding rates are down on most major exchanges, particularly for stablecoin-margined pairs, data from Coinalyze shows. On\u2011Chain Growth Clashes With Market Mood Nansen data shows the number of transactions rose by 11% over the last seven days to 182 million. Active addresses climbed 10% to 146,700 in the same span. Even so, price action has ignored these gains. XLM fell beneath its 50\u2011day and 100\u2011day Exponential Moving Averages, and momentum appears to favor sellers. Some market watchers suggest that deep negative funding could trigger a short squeeze, turning sentiment around if shorts rush to cover. Chart Patterns Warn Of Drop The daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, with $0.21 forming the lower trendline. That level also marked April\u2019s lows when altcoins broadly sold off. XLM has slipped below the 60% Fibonacci Retracement zone, where many traders expect a bounce. A clean break under the triangle could unleash algorithm\u2011driven orders, sending price toward $0.15. Related Reading: Brazil\u2019s Central Bank Hacked\u2014$40M In Crypto Washed In Aftermath Meanwhile, Stellar\u2019s fundamentals look solid, but technical signals remain bearish. Traders and holders should watch that $0.21 line. A strong rebound there could restore confidence in on\u2011chain strength. On the flip side, a slide through support may spark faster losses. Either way, XLM\u2019s near\u2011term path hinges on that key level. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "XRP&#8217;s market dominance may be on the verge of a historic breakout, with analyst Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) suggesting the token could command as much as 30% of the entire crypto market cap in this cycle\u2014representing a fivefold surge from current levels. 30% XRP Dominance? The bold projection stems from an emerging bullish structure on the XRP dominance chart, reinforced by a key technical signal: the three-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has broken its multi-year downtrend for the first time since XRP&#8217;s last local highs. This shift, visible on the attached chart, signals a significant change in market dynamics, potentially marking the beginning of a new accumulation-driven expansion. The analyst argues that XRP dominance has completed a textbook Wyckoff accumulation pattern. \u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much completed a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, and I would argue we\u2019re nearing the end of Phase D and about to enter Phase E,\u201d they noted. According to the Wyckoff method, Phase E represents the breakout phase, where assets typically enter strong markup periods after prolonged accumulation. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen This interpretation is supported by a side-by-side comparison of the theoretical Wyckoff schematic overlaid directly on XRP dominance price action. The analyst specifically points to the recent &#8220;Last Point of Support&#8221; (LPS) as confirmation that XRP is transitioning toward breakout territory, having already completed the \u201cSpring\u201d phase\u2014a final shakeout that traps late sellers before a sustained rally. &#8220;If that\u2019s correct, we should see significant upside in XRP dominance,\u201d the analyst continued, adding that the signal is particularly meaningful when viewed on the three-day timeframe, which filters out short-term noise and emphasizes broader cyclical trends. In terms of concrete targets, the analyst acknowledges that consensus among market participants remains modest, with many expecting a peak in XRP dominance around 14%. However, CryptoInsightUK argues this is a gross underestimation of potential upside in the event that XRP reclaims narrative leadership in the crypto space. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $9 In Euphoric Fifth Wave, Elliott Wave Analyst Predicts \u201cI believe we could push as high as 20%. There\u2019s even a possibility we reach broader capital inflows accompanying a Bitcoin breakout to new all-time highs. Many are calling for a top around 14% dominance, but I believe we could push as high as 20%,\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s even a possibility we reach 30%, though I\u2019m personally targeting the 20% zone, which would represent a 5x increase in dominance from current levels.\u201d XRP\u2019s current market dominance sits below 6%, making the analyst\u2019s 20\u201330% target not just ambitious but transformative. It would mark the first time since the early XRP rally days in 2017 that XRP commanded such a share of the crypto market. The broader context driving this thesis is the possibility of a liquidity-driven crypto cycle, catalyzed by Bitcoin achieving new highs and investor capital rotating into alternative assets. \u201cIf this coincides with Bitcoin breaking out to new all-time highs and broader capital flowing into the market, I believe we could witness a major price expansion for XRP\u2014one that few are currently expecting,\u201d the analyst added. At press time, XRP traded at $2.28. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-risks-downside-if-resistance-holds-2700-level-is-critical/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading above the $2,500 level, showing notable strength despite recent volatility across the broader crypto market. Since early May, ETH has been trapped in a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, struggling to establish a clear trend as both bulls and bears wait for confirmation. However, recent price action suggests growing momentum, with bulls maintaining control above key support zones. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low \u2013 Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis pointing to a decisive moment ahead for Ethereum. According to Runefelt, a breakout above the $2,700 resistance level is essential to ignite an impulsive move toward higher levels. Without that breakout, ETH risks remaining range-bound or revisiting lower demand zones. The current market structure, combined with positive sentiment surrounding altcoins and growing institutional interest in Ethereum, contributes to the optimism. Still, the coming days will be critical. A sustained move above $2,700 could open the door for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, while failure to break out may delay Ethereum\u2019s next major leg up. As Bitcoin trades just below its all-time highs, Ethereum\u2019s next move could also determine the short-term trajectory for the altcoin market at large. Ethereum Leads Altcoin Recovery Altcoins have been stuck in a prolonged bear market since 2022, with many tokens still trading well below their all-time highs. Amid this challenging backdrop, Ethereum has emerged as the leader of a potential recovery. Since its April lows, ETH has more than doubled in price, surging over 100% and reclaiming key support levels above $2,500. This sharp rebound suggests that a new bullish phase for Ethereum\u2014and potentially the broader altcoin market\u2014could be in the early stages. However, the optimism is tempered by growing macroeconomic risks. Recent U.S. data has raised concerns about systemic fragility, with rising Treasury yields and persistent inflation fueling uncertainty across risk assets. Investors remain cautious as higher yields could limit liquidity flows into crypto, particularly into speculative altcoins. According to Carl Runefelt, Ethereum\u2019s price structure is approaching a critical point. He highlights that ETH is currently trading within a rising wedge pattern\u2014a bearish formation that often precedes a sharp pullback. Runefelt warns that if Ethereum fails to break decisively above the $2,700 resistance level soon, the price may reject and fall toward lower support, potentially leading to a drastic correction. For now, Ethereum remains range-bound between $2,400 and $2,700. A confirmed breakout above the upper boundary could fuel continued bullish momentum and trigger a broader altcoin rally. But failure to hold current levels, especially with bearish macro pressure building, could signal that the recent gains were a temporary relief rally. Ethereum\u2019s next move will likely define the near-term direction for the entire altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Wyckoff Accumulation Hints At Explosive Q3 \u2013 $4K Level In Sight ETH Faces Key Resistance Amid Rising Momentum Ethereum is showing strength as it trades at $2,574.70, gaining over 2.2% in the last session. As shown in the 3-day chart, ETH has remained range-bound since early May, fluctuating between the $2,400 support and the $2,700 resistance. The latest move above the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), currently at $2,226 and $2,644, respectively, signals growing bullish momentum. However, Ethereum still faces a significant challenge near the 200-day SMA, currently sitting at $2,791, right below the critical $2,800 liquidity level. The price has tested this resistance zone multiple times without success, suggesting that a strong breakout above $2,700\u2013$2,800 is needed to initiate an impulsive move higher. Volume remains stable, and ETH\u2019s ability to hold recent gains hints at continued accumulation, but a lack of decisive follow-through could signal buyer exhaustion. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook If bulls manage to reclaim $2,800, it would open the door toward $3,000 and confirm a breakout from the multi-month range. On the downside, a failure to hold $2,500 could trigger a drop back toward $2,400 or even $2,200 if broader market conditions deteriorate. For now, ETH remains in a pivotal zone, and its next major move will likely determine broader altcoin momentum. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/chartist-slams-misleading-dogecoin-analysis/",
      "summary": "Technical analyst Kevin, better known on X as @Kev_Capital_TA, rekindled debate over Dogecoin\u2019s market structure on Sunday when he urged traders to ignore the \u201cnon-stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes\u201d and to concentrate on the two signals that have guided the meme-coin\u2019s price for more than two years. \u201cNot much has changed for Dogecoin here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t let the other analysts on this platform flood you with non stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes. We know what to watch for here.\u201d Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Kevin\u2019s view hinges on the weekly chart he posted on 26 June. At that time, Dogecoin (DOGE) was hovering near $0.166\u2014and, according to his chart, sitting directly on an ascending support cluster that has defined every major move since the 2022 bear-market washout. \u201cLooking at Dogecoin on the weekly time frame,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can see that ever since the bear market breakout on the weekly RSI back in 2022, any time DOGE has hit that level again\u2014which has happened five times now\u2014Doge has gone on to see major bounces. A failure of this weekly RSI level along with a failure of the $0.143-$0.127 level would be the line in the sand between longer term bearish price action or continued bull.\u201d Related Reading: The $1 Dogecoin Dream Is Alive: Chartist Lays Out Parabolic Scenario The chart shows Dogecoin sitting just millimetres above a confluence of the green 0.382 Fibonacci retracement ($0.13778), the upper boundary of a falling trend line that has been in force since May 2021 and the weekly 200 SMA and EMA. Previously, Kevin stated via X: \u201cWeekly 200 SMA and EMA are must holds for Dogecoin along with the macro .382 and down trending support.\u201d Beneath lies the horizontal \u201cline in the sand\u201d at $0.143-$0.127\u2014a zone Kevin has ring-fenced with bold yellow trend lines. Below the price pane, the weekly Relative Strength Index tells an equally focused story. Kevin has drawn a white band just above the 40-line; the yellow RSI profile has now tapped that band five times. Each tag coincided with a price trough circled in orange on the main chart. The oscillator\u2019s simple moving average (plotted in magenta) has curled below 50 but remains above the 40-support, keeping the pattern intact. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst\u2014Here\u2019s The Target Overhead, Kevin\u2019s chart maps a hierarchy of Fibonacci checkpoints: the 0.5 retracement at $0.18988 (red), the tightly stacked 0.618 ($0.26169) and 0.65 ($0.28548) (yellow), and the 0.786 ($0.41317) (blue). Two large violet supply boxes\u2014one between $1.00 and $1.30 and another around $2.20 and $2.70\u2014represent possible bull run targets. Kevin refrains from forecasting how quickly those zones might come into play, emphasising instead that holding the current support cluster is the single prerequisite for any higher-time-frame bullish thesis. The analyst also zoomed out to the broader digital-asset landscape in a Sunday follow-up. \u201cThe biggest moves for #Altcoins have yet to occur,\u201d he argued, tying potential break-outs to macro-economic easing. \u201cIf the macro leads us to further easing and the market sniffs that out \u2026 then the ingredients will be in place for a massive move higher on Alts. Altcoins have always required the proper ingredients to make a sustained out-performance over #BTC for months. We\u2019re closer than many understand; we just need a few more things to fall into place.\u201d For now, Kevin\u2019s message is stripped to its essentials: watch the weekly RSI band and the $0.143-$0.127 price shelf. As long as both survive, the chartist sees no reason to overhaul his structural bias\u2014no matter how crowded the Dogecoin commentary stream becomes. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.172.
