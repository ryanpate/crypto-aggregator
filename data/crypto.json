      "summary": "Ledger has announced a limited-time 30% discount on nearly all color models of its popular Nano S Plus and Nano X hardware wallets, valid through July 15. The promotion has drawn fresh attention to the company\u2019s flagship products, widely regarded as industry benchmarks for secure crypto storage. Together, the Nano S Plus and Nano X boast 13,345 reviews, the majority of which are positive, underscoring the strong trust and satisfaction among users worldwide. But what makes Ledger such a popular hardware wallet? Ledger Wallet\u2019s Blend of Security, Comfort, and Style \u2013 this is what makes them so attractive to its loyal fanbase and newbies alike. Ledger excels in the areas of security, comfort level, and overall style, but it\u2019s the wallet\u2019s security features that attract users. Ledger relies on a multi-layered security profile, with several noticeable features, like: \u2705 The PIN code that secures the actual device to prevent unauthorized access is required to complete any transaction \u2705 The 24-word phrase, which acts as the master key, secures your funds against any malicious access \u2705 The trademark Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System (BOLOS), which isolates any installed apps from one another and the 24-word phrase from all apps and the operating system itself \u2705 Secure Element Chip, the hardware component that keeps the private keys offline for a higher level of security Plus, Ledger\u2019s Donjon team, which consists of seasoned hackers, is constantly testing the products\u2019 security to identify any potential vulnerabilities. Their efforts are part of Ledger\u2019s Bug Bounty program, which rewards anyone who finds security weaknesses in Bitcoin, showcasing the team\u2019s commitment to continuous improvements in the security department. While security is the most important aspect, other features matter as well, like the comfort level associated with carrying and using the wallet. Ledger\u2019s Nano S Plus and Nano X are the sleekest and most comfortable to use and wear, thanks to their slim builds. Nano S Plus consists of steel and plastic, weighing only 0.74 ounces, while Nano X is slightly larger, thanks to the lithium battery, reaching 1.19 ounces. The slim format makes them comfortable to wear, even as keychains if you always insist on having them with you. Finally, the color palette offers a final touch to the already unique style, imbuing the wallets with a modern vibe. Colors like emerald-green, sapphire-blue, and amethyst-purple come with a plus of personality and X factor. The Massive 30% Discount Ends on July 15 Ledger\u2019s flash promotion (offering a 30% discount on its Nano S Plus and Nano X wallets) is set to end on July 15, giving buyers less than a week to take advantage. The deal aims to spotlight two of Ledger\u2019s most widely used products, with a combined user base of around 7 million worldwide. Most color options are eligible, with only onyx-black and BTC-orange for the Nano X, and matte-black and BTC-orange for the Nano S Plus excluded from the promotion. Should You Buy the Ledger Wallet? Nobody can answer that for you, but if you\u2019ve decided that the Ledger wallet meets your expectations in terms of security, style, and ease of use, and you want to buy it, buy it today. Or, at the very least, until July 15, when the current 30% promotion ends, because discounts like these don\u2019t come often. Also, go to Ledger\u2019s website and scroll through their offers. You\u2019ll find a lot of products and accessories, based on your needs. Remember, this is not financial advice. Do your own research before buying any product."

Market Reaction Follows Viral Meme Meme tokens often depend on hype, and PNUT was no exception. After Musk\u2019s message spread, order books filled fast. Buy orders outnumbered sells, driving price momentum. Crypto bots and retail traders piled in, hoping to catch the wave. Some investors told reporters they moved funds into PNUT within minutes of seeing Musk\u2019s post.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Jaydee has predicted a 50% rally for the XRP price. He highlighted a resistance level, which the altcoin needs to break above on its BTC pair to record this massive uptrend. XRP Price Eyes 50% Rally With Break Above $2.20 In an X post, Jaydee predicted that the XRP price will record a 50% \u201cmoonshot\u201d rally once it breaks above the $0.00002 resistance level on its Bitcoin pair. XRP has since broken above this resistance level, suggesting that this moonshot rally may be imminent, with the altcoin surging to as high as $3.35. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 A rally to $3.35 will bring the XRP price close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. In a subsequent analysis, Jaydee confirmed that XRP could rally to new ATHs with a successful break above this resistance level. On the other hand, he warned that the altcoin could crash to as low as $1.60 if it fails to hold this level on at least the 3-day timeframe. Crypto analyst Guy also recently predicted that the XRP price could rally to a new ATH of $5.30. The analyst indicated that the $2.33 level is the key to kickstarting this uptrend for the altcoin. Once XRP breaks above, he predicts that it will rally to $2.55. A break above this $2.55 level would then pave the way for another rally to the current ATH and the Fibonacci extension at $5.30. Possible Scenarios Following Break Above $2.30 In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined three potential scenarios that could unfold following the XRP price break above $2.30. The first scenario is the cleanest move, in which she predicts that XRP could run towards $2.45, then flips $2.30 into support on a backtest. CasiTrades remarked that this gives the altcoin a solid base for a move to $2.69 and beyond. Related Reading: Will XRP Dethrone Ethereum To Lead This Altcoin Season? For the second scenario, the crypto analyst described this as a more aggressive move. In this case, she predicts that the XRP price could record a sharp breakout through $2.30 and head straight to $2.69. From there, she added that the altcoin could pull back to $2.45 as the mid-way support zone before continuing its uptrend. The third scenario is the most bullish for the XRP price. CasiTrades predicts that the altcoin could break through $2.69, confirm this price level as support, and then clear the way towards $3 and above. This would then put the current ATH in sight for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.32, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-action-signals-momentum-shift-btc-sleeps-and-eth-moves/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has finally pushed above the critical $2,600 level after weeks of range-bound trading, marking a potential turning point in its price structure. This breakout comes as bullish momentum builds, with Ethereum now preparing for a possible expansion toward the $2,800 resistance level\u2014a zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts since early May. The coming days will be decisive in shaping Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory, especially if bulls manage to drive the price beyond this key barrier. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise A breakout above $2,800 would not only signal renewed strength in Ethereum but could also catalyze a broader altcoin rally. Market sentiment is gradually shifting, with traders growing more optimistic amid easing macroeconomic pressures and signs of renewed risk appetite. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared an Ethereum chart showing a clear upward breakout from compression. This technical pattern typically precedes strong directional moves, and in this case, it favors the bulls. Pillows suggests that Ethereum is taking the lead while Bitcoin remains in consolidation, indicating that ETH may be setting the pace for the next phase of the crypto cycle. All eyes are now on the $2,800 level, which could unlock significant upside if breached. Ethereum Leads the Charge: Major Move Ahead Since early May, Ethereum has traded within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, unable to break out despite several attempts. This extended period of sideways action has built up pressure, and market participants widely expect the next move to be significant. Bulls have shown resilience, defending demand levels and keeping ETH above the $2,500 mark for several weeks. However, a clear breakout above critical resistance is still needed to confirm a broader bullish trend. Altcoins continue to struggle, with most still trading below key resistance levels. Many analysts agree that a sustained Ethereum breakout is the missing trigger for the long-awaited altseason. Market leadership from ETH has historically marked the start of major altcoin rallies, and the current setup could be no different. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a 4-hour chart highlighting an upward breakout from a compression pattern just above $2,600. According to Pillow\u2019s analysis, Ethereum is leading the market while Bitcoin remains in a holding pattern below all-time highs. This leadership role for ETH could signal a shift in capital toward altcoins, especially if Ethereum follows through and breaks the $2,800 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support \u2013 Momentum Builds For Range Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Upward Momentum Builds Above $2,600 Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after breaking above the key $2,600 level. The 12-hour chart reveals a bullish structure forming, with ETH currently trading at $2,612.61. This move follows a sustained period of consolidation between $2,400 and $2,600, where buyers consistently defended lower levels. Now, Ethereum is printing higher lows and gradually reclaiming its moving averages. Price is now trading above the 50-period and 100-period simple moving averages (SMAs), currently positioned at $2,483.37 and $2,536.77, respectively. This alignment is bullish and suggests ETH is building momentum for a potential retest of the $2,700\u2013$2,800 resistance zone. A successful break above this area would confirm the breakout from compression and open the door for a more significant rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens \u2013 Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Volume remains moderate, but recent green candles show growing buyer interest as ETH pushes upward.

      "summary": "Trump Media &#38; Technology Group (TMTG) quietly lodged an S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission late on July 8, seeking approval for the \u201cTruth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.\u201d Despite a swirl of social-media posts placing the paperwork in early June, the SEC\u2019s time-stamp confirms the filing date as July 8. The prospectus sketches a five-coin portfolio weighted approximately 70 percent to bitcoin, 15 percent to ether, 8 percent to solana, 5 percent to Cronos and 2 percent to XRP, making it the first Trump-branded product to diversify beyond the two largest digital assets. The trust, structured as a Nevada business trust and sponsored by boutique issuer Yorkville America Digital, aims to list its shares on NYSE Arca. Foris DAX Trust \u2014 the US institutional arm of Crypto.com \u2014 is named digital-asset custodian, while authorized participants will create and redeem blocks of 10,000 shares in kind or for cash, subject to NYSE rule changes. The prospectus also discloses that staking rewards on ether, solana and cronos may be passed through to the fund, a design choice that would set a precedent among US spot-crypto ETFs. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why XRP Stands To Gain Big From Ripple\u2019s RLUSD Analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg distilled the filing in two succinct posts on X: \u201cNew filing for the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, which will be a spot crypto basket holding Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP and Cronos,\u201d he wrote; in a follow-up, he reproduced the pivotal language: \u201cthe Trust\u2019s allocation\u2026 is initially expected to approximate 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP.\u201d Those percentages now serve as the market\u2019s working model for how the Trump universe ranks crypto\u2019s \u2018blue chips.\u2019 Why Solana, Cronos And XRP? Overall, the allocation may serve as an implicit ranking of the top five crypto assets as viewed through the lens of Trump\u2019s inner circle. Binance top trader by PnL Nachi (@alphawifhat) commented via X: \u201cI think it&#8217;s useful to look at the allocation ratio of the Truth Social Crypto ETF [&#8230;] I see this as an indication of how Trump&#8217;s crypto team looks at the top crypto assets and what are the top 5 they want to value the most. This could be a catalyst to pump CRO as it&#8217;s a dark horse.\u201d Solana\u2019s climb to an 8 percent weight is more than a momentum trade. CME Group this spring announced cash-settled Solana futures pending CFTC sign-off, extending the same institutional rails that helped bitcoin and ether graduate into ETF form. Notably, the SEC has set a July deadline for spot Solana ETF refilings, indicating a potential approval before the October 2 deadline. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Cronos leaps over better-capitalized tokens because Crypto.com is literally powering Trump\u2019s ETFs. \u201cWe are proud to partner with Trump Media and Yorkville\u2026 including the first-of-its-kind basket of tokens featuring CRO,\u201d Crypto.com co-founder Kris Marszalek said in March when the multi-year, roughly $2.7 billion partnership was unveiled. Under the agreement, Crypto.com supplies custody, liquidity and back-end order routing for all Truth-branded funds. XRP brings up the rear at two percent, reflecting both its renewed legitimacy and its still-nascent institutional plumbing. On June 27, Ripple Labs announced that it will withdraw its cross appeal against the SEC. The token\u2019s modest two-percent slice is politicized as much as it is financial. In early March a staffer from Ballard Partners\u2014the K-Street shop that counts Ripple as a client\u2014slipped Donald Trump draft language for a Truth Social post urging that XRP, Solana and Cardano be placed in a national \u201cCrypto Strategic Reserve.\u201d Trump hit \u201cpost\u201d and only later discovered the Ripple connection; insiders told Politico he \u201cwas furious and felt like he\u2019d been used.\u201d Despite that, the inclusion of XRP still shows Trump\u2019s ties with Ripple.
