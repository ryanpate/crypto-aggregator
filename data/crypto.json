      "summary": "Ripple Labs, a crypto payments company, continues to set its ambitions and those of XRP higher than ever as it edges closer to disrupting the global financial messaging giant SWIFT. After Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously projected that XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT\u2019s volume, new estimates now point to even bolder targets. How Ripple Securing 20% Of SWIFT Could Impact XRP A new report by Paul Barron, a technologist and crypto analyst, has revealed an updated forecast for Ripple. The report highlights XRP\u2019s growing potential to take on SWIFT in cross-border transactions. Ripple\u2019s ambitions in the global financial infrastructure are becoming more tangible, as new projections suggest that XRP could eventually process up to 20% of SWIFT\u2019s transactional volume. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Notably, these fresh estimates come just a month after Garlinghouse and the Ripple company predicted a 14% share in SWIFT\u2019s volume within five years. Now, with increasing institutional traction, growing market momentum, and rapid adoption, expectations are rising sharply. SWIFT, the global messaging network used by international banks and financial institutions to securely transmit information and cross-border payment instructions, currently handles $150 trillion in annual transaction volume. Based on this large figure, Barron disclosed that Ripple&#8217;s previously predicted 14% transactional volume projection would mean $21 trillion flowing annually through the XRP Ledger (XRPL). While 14% of SWIFT\u2019s volume already represents a significant amount, Ripple now believes that XRP could handle an even greater share of the global cross-border payments market. Based on the same calculations used by Barron, if Ripple were to achieve 20% of SWIFT\u2019s volume, it would translate to approximately $30 trillion in annual value flowing through the XRP Ledger. This projection underscores Ripple\u2019s growing confidence in XRP as a viable alternative to the decades-old SWIFT network. The company has consistently indicated its goals to replace SWIFT, with XRP becoming a central player in transforming the global payments structure. XRP Scaling Potential And Market Implications The vision of XRP processing a significant amount of SWIFT\u2019s volume annually raises major implications for its scalability, long-term utility and valuation. At such a scale, XRP would not merely be a bridge currency for remittance but a pillar in the future of traditional finance and digital currency markets. Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Ripple\u2019s strategy hinges on overtaking SWIFT\u2019s legacy system, which has long been criticized for its slow settlement times and high costs. The XRPL, with its near-instant settlement and low transaction fees, presents a modern alternative capable of streamlining transactions at scale. This expanding use case could elevate XRP, possibly even driving its current price of $2.78 higher to uncharted levels. If Ripple can execute its projections and secure 20% of SWIFT\u2019s volume, it would mark a turning point not just for the company but for the broader crypto industry.

      "summary": "After a powerful breakout last week that pushed Bitcoin into a new all-time high of $118,667, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency appears to be taking a breather. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $117,953, slightly below its recent peak. The move followed a string of consecutive daily gains as bullish momentum swept across the crypto industry. In a technical analysis shared on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst RLinda pointed out two scenarios that may play out over the coming days and weeks, depending on how Bitcoin reacts to nearby resistance and support levels. Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Support Zones Could Affect Bitcoin\u2019s Next Big Move RLinda\u2019s technical analysis begins with identifying the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s recent all-time high. Although Bitcoin has entered what seems to be a consolidation phase, there\u2019s no confirmed top just yet. The market structure still favors bullish continuation, especially considering Bitcoin is just coming out of a prolonged two-month consolidation zone and entering a realization phase. According to the 1-hour candlestick price chart, Bitcoin is currently trading just above a support area below $117,500. If Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, the leading cryptocurrency could kick off a cascade of corrections that could drive the price to $115,500, then potentially to $114,300, and even back to the previous all-time high of $111,800. Below that, the 0.5 and 0.705 Fibonacci levels around $113,031 and $111,960 respectively may act as temporary cushions. The last major defensive buy zone is around $110,400, where bulls may step in for a bounce. Basically, what this means is that if Bitcoin loses the support level at $115,500, it could slip back to $110,000 before encountering another strong buy support zone. Image From TradingView: RLinda Bitcoin To $125K, But It Must Breach Resistance First On the other hand, Bitcoin can still push above $118,000 and increase to $125,000, but only under certain conditions. The condition of the rally&#8217;s continuation depends primarily on Bitcoin registering a decisive daily close above $118,400 and $118,900. In her words, a daily close above these price levels would hint at a \u201cbreakout of structure.\u201d This, in turn, would confirm a transition from consolidation into another impulsive phase upward. In essence, both the bearish and bullish outlooks depend on how Bitcoin reacts at any of the important zones, either support at $116,700 or resistance above $118,400 before making a directional move. However, it is important to note that the consolidation after last week&#8217;s rally could last for weeks or even months, much like we&#8217;ve seen in previous rallies this cycle. According to the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric from Glassnode, Bitcoin\u2019s current level of long-term profitability sentiment is at 0.69. This is notably below the 0.75 mark associated with euphoric market conditions, despite Bitcoin having just printed a new all-time high. Image From X: Glassnode Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Bitcoin spent around 228 days above the 0.75 euphoria threshold in the previous bull market cycle. In contrast, this current cycle has only seen about 30 days above that level, which suggests long-term holders have not yet fully exited into profit and the leading cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t reached overheated conditions.

      "summary": "Ethereum has finally touched the $3,000 price level once again after spending weeks trading in a narrow range beneath $2,800. This recent breakout, although brief, marks the first time Ethereum reclaimed this level since early February. According to technical analyst Merlijn The Trader, Ethereum\u2019s next destination after breaking past $3,000 is already in sight. Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Bull Flag Breakout Points To Measured Move For Ethereum Ethereum went through an interesting rally last week alongside Bitcoin&#8217;s push to new all-time highs. However, this Ethereum price rally, which saw it touch $3,000 again, wasn&#8217;t based on momentum spillover from Bitcoin alone. This is because Ethereum itself experienced significant institutional interest from Spot Ethereum ETFs. According to data from SoSoValue, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined $907.99 million in inflows last week, their best week since the products launched in July 2024. Thursday, July 10, alone was highlighted by inflows of $383.10 million, making it the largest single-day inflow for any Ethereum ETF in 2025 so far. In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Merlijn pointed to a confirmed bull flag breakout on Ethereum\u2019s daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, the technical setup proposed by the analyst follows a falling wedge reversal that preceded the current uptrend. According to the chart attached to his analysis, the falling wedge that led to the reversal was formed from the December 2024 highs to the April 2025 lows, with the breakout occurring in mid-May. The breakout eventually saw Ethereum entering into a tight flag-like consolidation that spanned between May and June, until the most recent breakout above $2,700. That pattern has now resolved to the upside, and the next technical level of interest is a measured move based on the price action that formed the pole of the bull flag. This measured move places the next technical level of price interest at $3,834. Image From X: Merlijn The Trader 80% Of ETH Now In Profit On-chain indicators further validate Ethereum\u2019s current strength. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum&#8217;s price action has been dancing around the $3,000 mark since Friday, crossing it multiple times intraday. During this back and forth, 124.13 million ETH out of the 155.04 million total supply crossed into profitability, which represents 79.96% of all tokens. This reading is particularly interesting as it is the highest percentage recorded since January 2025. Image From X: Santiment The same data shows Ethereum is just 13 million coins away from matching the total supply in profit at its previous all-time high of profitability recorded in December 2024. This shift toward a profit-heavy network state tends to encourage holding behavior and long-term conviction, which could translate into reduced sell pressure in the coming week. This, in turn, could see Ethereum close a daily candle above $3,000 and move toward the $3,834 price target during the new week. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,960, up by 17.5% in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "Popular market analyst with X username Daan Crypto has provided an important insight into the Ethereum market, stating the altcoin finds itself in a delicate price situation. Notably, Ethereum (ETH) prices crossed above $2,800, a critical resistance level, before briefly touching the $3,000 zone. During this period, the second-largest cryptocurrency registered market gains of 16.77% to produce a remarkable price performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Through 50EMA After Rejection, ETH Dominance Sees Resurgence Bulls Eye $4,000 As Long-Term Range Breakout Holds In an X post on July 12, Daan Crypto explains that $2,800 has acted as a long-standing resistance capping Ethereum price action on both sides over the past two years. Following recent bullish fortune, the prominent altcoin decisively broke through this price barrier, signaling intent for further price gains. However, the price retracement from $3,000 suggests the bulls are facing immediate profit-taking pressure that may force a return below $2,800. According to Daan Crypto, while a quick price dip and buy-back up may not harm current bullish sentiments, a stalled price action under $2,800 may force ETH to revisit lower levels around $2,100-$2,160. The analyst highlights that ETH bulls maintaining a price point above $2,800 is critical to sustaining the present bullish structure, paving the way for a price return to the market cycle peak at $4,000. From a risk/reward perspective, this level now offers traders a clear invalidation point that market bulls remain in control as long as ETH stays above $2,800. Interestingly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the ETH daily chart backs the potential of a sustained price uptrend. This is because the MACD line recently crossed above the signal line, which is largely interpreted as a bullish signal. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is valued at 71.12, in the overbought zone. This report suggests Ethereum holds strong potential of becoming an overheated market, resulting in a wide spread distribution. Related Reading: Dogecoin Megaphone Pattern Confirms Price Blowup, \u2018Don\u2019t Miss This Last Rally\u2019\u2014Analyst Ethereum Market Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,966 on the daily chart, reflecting a 0.11% decline in the past day. Despite the minor pullback, the asset has posted an impressive 16.53% gain over the past month, indicating that the majority of investors remain in profit. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Sentora, the Ethereum network recorded total network fees of $6.04 million, representing a modest 0.60% drop compared to the previous week. This slight decline in fees points to a small reduction in transaction activity on the network. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges registered outflows of $493 million, suggesting investors are opting to keep their assets in private wallets. Such behavior typically reflects growing confidence in the market, as users are less inclined to sell and more likely to hold in anticipation of continued price appreciation.
