      "summary": "Bitcoin has been exploring new all-time highs (ATHs) recently, but Strategy still seems to be in accumulation mode as it has announced another large purchase. Strategy Has Bought 4,225 Bitcoin In Latest Acquisition As announced by Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in an X post, the company has made a fresh Bitcoin acquisition, continuing its chain of 2025 buys. With the latest purchase, the firm has added 4,225 BTC to its holdings. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the buy occurred between July 7th and July 13th, and involved an average BTC cost basis of $111,827. This means the 4,225 tokens were acquired for about $472.5 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $123,000\u2014But Inflows Are Just A Fraction Of 2024\u2019s Peak In the same period as the acquisition, BTC witnessed a breakout to new ATHs. If the purchase is to go by, it seems Strategy is still interested in buying even at these high prices. &#8220;Short Bitcoin if you hate money,&#8221; said Saylor in an earlier X post. After the latest buy, the total holding of the firm has hit 601,550 BTC. The company spent around $42.87 billion to assemble this stack and today, its value stands at $72.25 billion, implying a significant profit of 68.5%. Earlier in the day, another Bitcoin treasury company added to its holdings: Metaplanet. According to the X post by CEO Simon Gerovich, the company has added 797 BTC to its reserve, taking the total to 16,352 BTC. Unlike Strategy, though, the firm&#8217;s average coin cost basis is on the higher side, standing at $100,191 right now. In some other news, while the big players in the market have been buying BTC for a while now, data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode suggests retail investors have finally joined in. In the chart, the data of the Accumulation Trend Score is shown for the different segments of the Bitcoin userbase. The &#8220;Accumulation Trend Score&#8221; is an indicator that tells us about whether the BTC investors are accumulating or distributing. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the score has recently been pretty close to 1 for the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohort. This means that these large hands, popularly known as the whales, have been showing a near-perfect accumulation trend. The latest rally in the cryptocurrency may be a product of this conviction. While the whales have been buying, the rest of the Bitcoin market has been showing behavior that tends more toward distribution. The mega whales, carrying more than 10,000 BTC, have remained in selling mode with an Accumulation Trend Score around 0.3.

BTC Price Bitcoin went up to $123,000 earlier, but it seems the asset has since seen a setback as its price is down to $119,900. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "A recent report has found that US President Donald Trump\u2019s official memecoin, TRUMP, had a faster listing process on crypto exchanges than the average memecoin and generated millions of dollars in gains for the platforms. Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23\u2014Is It Too Far-Fetched? Crypto Exchanges Profit From TRUMP Memecoin On Monday, news agency Reuters shared an analysis of market data and industry announcements related to the listing of the official TRUMP memecoin on some of the biggest crypto exchanges by market share. In January, President Trump surprised the crypto industry after launching his official token ahead of the start of his presidency. The cryptocurrency quickly skyrocketed to its all-time high (ATH) of $75, yielding significant profits for many early investors. However, the memecoin faced heavy backlash from the community, with several investors calling the President\u2019s crypto venture a \u201cbig red flag.\u201d Notably, 80% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply was held by the Trump family and their partners, raising concerns over \u201csuch a high concentration of ownership\u201d, which can allow the team behind it to \u201csell large amounts of it at once, collapsing the price for retail investors,\u201d Reuters noted. The report claims that exchanges have been \u201cmajor beneficiaries of Trump&#8217;s embrace of the industry,\u201d as TRUMP has generated millions of dollars in revenue for the 10 largest exchanges reviewed by Reuters. Based on standard fee estimates compiled for the analysis, the crypto platforms allegedly made more than $172 million in trading fees since the token\u2019s listing. Additionally, the token has \u201cfavored a small group of investors,\u201d with 45 crypto wallets making around $1.2 billion in profits over the past six months. Nonetheless, as the token trades at 87.1% below its ATH, 712,777 wallets accumulate a collective loss of $4.3 billion, according to Bubblemaps data. Presidential Token Saw Express Listing Process According to the report, the largest exchanges, including Binance, Gate.io, Bitget, MEXC, OKX, Coinbase, Bybit, Upbit, Crypto.com, and HTX, listed Trump\u2019s token \u201cwith unusual speed\u201d compared to other recent prominent memecoins, despite the industry\u2019s concerns. Reuters\u2019 analysis showed that eight of the 10 largest crypto exchanges listed TRUMP within the first 48 hours since its launch. Coinbase listed the memecoin three days later, while Upbit added the token nearly a month later, on February 13. Meanwhile, the same 10 exchanges took significantly more to list Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and dogwifhat (WIF), the four other largest memecoins launched since 2022. Per the report, all 10 exchanges listed PEPE and BONK, while nine listed WIF, and only seven listed FARTCOIN. For comparison, all 10 exchanges took an average of 129 days to list these tokens, but only took an average of four days to list the presidential memecoin. Bitget, MEXC, and Coinbase reportedly said they listed the token quickly to \u201crespond to overwhelming demand for the $TRUMP coin.\u201d Gracy Chen, Bitget\u2019s CEO, explained in a statement that \u201cthe crypto space was buzzing with the hype and, as any other token with a growing craze, it was imperative to add TRUMP.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Ignites Intraday Optimism With A Step Past $119,000 Threshold Chen told Reuters that Bitget also had concerns about the 80% supply figure but said the fact that the upcoming US president announced the coin on his social media accounts \u201cshould kind of solve the compliance issue.\u201d &#8220;Ultimately, user trading volume, demand \u2026 overrode the so-called risky factor here,&#8221; Bidget CEO concluded. As of this writing, TRUMP trades at $9.43, a 2.6% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $123,000 earlier today after crossing the $120,000 threshold late Sunday night. The move has added more than 10% to its value over the past week, pushing the global cryptocurrency market valuation above $3.87 trillion, inching toward the $4 trillion mark. The current rally has reignited discussions around volume dynamics and accumulation patterns, as analysts monitor potential early signals that may influence near-term market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Reach $135,000 By September\u2019s Close, Standard Chartered Forecasts Two contributors to CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, BorisVest and Darkfost, have highlighted technical patterns that emerged before and during Bitcoin\u2019s latest breakout. Their analyses suggest a combination of shrinking spot volume and surging accumulation activity may have played a role in driving prices higher. These insights provide a more nuanced view of the forces behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge, particularly at a time when market participants weigh upside potential against the possibility of volatility in uncharted price zones. Volume Drop on Binance Preceded Breakout, Analyst Says According to BorisVest, a notable collapse in spot trading volume on Binance preceded Bitcoin\u2019s move out of the $100,000 to $110,000 consolidation range. In his post titled \u201cBinance Spot Volume Collapsed Before Bitcoin\u2019s Breakout: Was It a Hidden Squeeze Signal?\u201d, he explained that declining spot volumes often represent quiet periods of either accumulation or distribution. Binance, due to its liquidity depth and user base, is seen as a reliable proxy for broader crypto market behavior. BorisVest noted that once the breakout began, trading volume spiked sharply. While such spikes can indicate local tops or bottoms, in this case, the surge in volume did not trigger a reversal but instead accelerated the rally. \u201cThat\u2019s a strong signal. If the move had no real backing, we would have seen a fast pullback. Instead, Bitcoin kept pushing higher,\u201d he wrote. He emphasized that volume acts as a roadmap for identifying zones of trade concentration and potential shifts in sentiment, cautioning that while Bitcoin\u2019s recent move appears structurally strong, market participants should be aware of the risks tied to high volatility zones. Accumulator Addresses Hit 2025 High Amid Price Surge In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost observed that Bitcoin \u201caccumulator addresses,\u201d wallets with a history of only buying and not selling BTC, have collectively acquired roughly 248,000 BTC in 2025 so far. This is well above the monthly average of 164,000 BTC, pointing to intensified buying activity in recent weeks. \u201cThese addresses have no history of distribution and their continued activity at current price levels indicates long-term positioning,\u201d he said. Darkfost also cautioned that if Bitcoin enters a correction or consolidation phase, some of these wallets could begin selling, which would disqualify them as accumulators and potentially introduce significant selling pressure. Related Reading: Who Flipped The Switch? Bitcoin STHs Accumulate While LTHs Take Profit At today\u2019s prices, the accumulated 248,000 BTC are worth about $30 billion.
