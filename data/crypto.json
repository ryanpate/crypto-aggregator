      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-uptrend-intact-but-binance-activity-warns-of-short-term-pullback/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high (ATH) yesterday, climbing to $111,999 on Binance exchange before dipping slightly to around $110,000 at the time of writing. While the broader trend remains bullish, some analysts now anticipate a short-term pullback. Bitcoin Remains Bullish But Some Pullback Expected According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, early warning signs suggest that BTC may face a brief correction. The analyst noted that if momentum doesn\u2019t pick up soon, Bitcoin could struggle to maintain its bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top Binance taker buy/sell volume has shown a noticeable spike in aggressive buy orders &#8211; usually a bullish signal &#8211; but sell volume has also risen in tandem, effectively absorbing most of the demand. Despite this uptick in buy volume, BTC\u2019s price has not responded proportionally, suggesting distribution or selling pressure. For the uninitiated, Binance taker buy/sell volume measures the amount of aggressive buying versus selling on the exchange using market orders. A higher taker buy volume indicates strong buyer interest, while higher taker sell volume signals stronger selling pressure. In addition, Binance open interest has surged during the recent price rally, signalling an influx of leveraged positions. While rising open interest can support further gains, the subdued price reaction raises concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s short-term strength. Meanwhile, funding rates have stayed mostly neutral throughout the rally. However, the most recent push to a new ATH saw BTC&#8217;s funding rates turn slightly positive, hinting at increasing long exposure and renewed bullish sentiment. The breakout also triggered significant short liquidations, likely fuelling a short squeeze. Data from Coinglass shows that over the past 24 hours, $521 million in positions were liquidated &#8211; $448 million of which were shorts. Market Needs A Breather Before Climbing Higher Concluding, the CryptoQuant contributor noted that despite the emerging signs of caution, Bitcoin\u2019s overall bullish structure remains intact. However, the market is now seeing the early signs of a potential short-term pullback, especially due to the spike-driven nature of the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Other analysts share a similar outlook for BTC. For example, crypto analyst Christian Chifoi suggested that the current price action may be a deceptive move designed to trap bullish traders &#8211; potentially pushing BTC down to $97,000 before the final rally begins. That said, the recent weakness observed in the US Dollar Index (DXY) has fuelled hopes for a capital reallocation to alternative assets, including BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $110,885, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/illegal-to-short-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action has shown intense strength in recent days to finally bounce fully from the weakness in late June. After briefly dipping into the low $108,000 range in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin managed to surge to a new all-time high of $112,022. According to data from Coinglass, this move was enough to cause over $470 million in short liquidations across the crypto market. Bitcoin&#8217;s latest price behavior has sparked a shift in sentiment and aligns with the argument that the window for shorting may have officially closed. According to crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, it is now effectively \u201cillegal\u201d to short Bitcoin. New Bitcoin Impulse May Have Already Started Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto noted that it is now illegal to short Bitcoin. This comment comes alongside a 24-hour period of intense price activity, with on-chain data showing a trading volume of $60.15 billion. Related Reading: Institutions Buy Bitcoin In Record Numbers, But Why Is Price Still Below $111,900 ATH? CrediBULL Crypto posted a detailed chart and technical analysis on X, explaining why he believes shorting Bitcoin is now a dangerous strategy. Notably, his analysis is based on the Elliott Wave count on the 8-hour candlestick timeframe chart. His previous wave analysis reflects two possible scenarios. The first involves a brief rejection above $110,000 followed by a corrective pullback toward the $102,000 zone, an area he highlighted as a key daily demand level. The outcome would be a sideways consolidation before the next major upward impulse. However, he has since acknowledged that Bitcoin may have already begun its next major leg up, which is the second scenario. This scenario bypasses the corrective phase in the first scenario entirely. As the analyst phrased it, \u201cthere is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun.\u201d In either scenario, CrediBULL\u2019s commentary stresses that the downside from current levels is limited, and shorting Bitcoin now is equivalent to fighting strong upward momentum. Why Shorting Bitcoin Now Is A Dangerous Bet It\u2019s now illegal to short Bitcoin. Not in the literal legal sense, but because Bitcoin&#8217;s current structure no longer supports bearish bets. The current setup is one of a continuation above $111,000 in the coming days. If Bitcoin does clear the $111,000 to $112,000 range with enough conviction, it would confirm a vertical rise into wave 3 of a new Elliott impulse cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Interestingly, the price target for this Wave 3 is around $130,000. A correction may follow from that level to form an impulse Wave 4 before Bitcoin enters another strong bullish leg. Then, finally, the most bullish scenario places Bitcoin on a final Wave 5 movement to $150,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,270. The downside is currently limited, and the focus now should be on identifying long opportunities rather than attempting to short what may be the early stages of another explosive rally.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) above $112,000, and if on-chain data is to go by, there is some real conviction behind the move. Bitcoin Realized Cap Shows ATH Breakout Not Just Speculative In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the &#8220;Realized Cap&#8221; of Bitcoin. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates the asset&#8217;s total value by assuming that the &#8216;true&#8217; value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading This is different from the methodology that the usual market cap employs, where all tokens part of the supply are assigned the same value: the current Bitcoin spot price. The last transaction of any token is likely to represent the last time that it changed hands on the network, so the price at that time could be considered as its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all coins, its value essentially represents a net cost basis for the entire supply. In other words, the model can be looked at as a measure of the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying in the present. During the past day, the Bitcoin market cap saw a surge as the spot price set a new record. But what about the Realized Cap? &#8220;Unlike market cap, Realized Cap reflects actual capital inflows &#8211; only rising when coins move at higher prices,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode, showing whether or not real capital inflows occurred for Bitcoin with this rally: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap has been following an upward trajectory for a while now, suggesting capital inflows have been coming into the asset. With the latest price surge, too, the metric has seen a leg up, corresponding to a whopping $4.4 billion flowing into the coin. &#8220;The $4.4B jump as $BTC broke a new ATH above $112K confirms real conviction behind the move, not just speculative markup,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. In some other news, the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is currently sitting around the 2.25 mark, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has pointed out in an X post. The MVRV Ratio measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and Realized Cap. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that BTC encountered resistance the last few times the metric hit a value around 2.75. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? Right now, the 2.75 level corresponds to a spot price of $130,900. &#8220;This will essentially be the first selling pressure point,&#8221; says the analyst.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-signal-last-time-preceded-464-rally/",
      "summary": "In a new video released June 9, crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK issued a extremely bullish XRP update, citing a convergence of technical signals that he believes could set the stage for a powerful upward move. Drawing parallels to previous market cycles, the analyst points to the reappearance of a signal that once preceded a 464% rally in XRP, and says this may mark the beginning of a similar explosive breakout. XRP Breakout Confirmed? Yesterday, XRP recorded its highest 4-hour close since May 23, breaking out of a prolonged range. The token has entered what he called a \u201cdense area of liquidity,\u201d an important technical zone that has historically preceded impulsive price action. In a notable divergence from typical market dynamics, XRP is leading Bitcoin, rather than following it. \u201cXRP is currently leading Bitcoin on this move,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve been calling for a while is for XRP to lead alts and lead a potential alt season.\u201d CryptoInsightUK sees further confirmation in Bitcoin\u2019s setup. BTC is still consolidating but pushing above the $111,000 liquidity zone. A move into that zone, he said, would \u201cgive us confluence that the price action XRP\u2019s displaying is not a fakeout.\u201d Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP\u2019s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated Structurally, XRP\u2019s trend remains intact. Despite recent pullbacks, the token has maintained its higher-low formation, a signal of technical strength. More importantly, XRP/BTC is beginning to show momentum reversal. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had the highest 4-hour close since the 24th of May. This is showing the momentum to the downside is waning.\u201d He highlights a specific line on the XRP/BTC chart referenced by fellow analyst Credible Crypto as the \u201cGandalf line\u201d\u2014a level that has acted as a pivot point for years. XRP has now closed above it on the 4-hour chart. &#8220;We\u2019ve wicked into it, bounced off it. We lose it, we get pushed down hard. We break it, we normally really go for it.&#8221; Zooming out, he points to the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) on XRP\u2019s price chart. If the current weekly candle closes above the RSI\u2019s simple moving average, it would be the first time since XRP\u2019s breakout off the lows\u2014an event that previously triggered a 464% move to $2.70. \u201cIf we get the bullish cross close\u2026 464% from this [level] would take us to $13.05,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to about $12 on this push.\u201d Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% \u201cMoonshot\u201d For XRP Price If This Line Breaks Moreover, the analyst anticipates a 325% move in XRP/BTC based on historical ratios and a potential surge in XRP dominance toward 14%, with an even more aggressive Elliott Wave count pointing to a possible move to 20% dominance. \u201cWe\u2019ve completed a Wyckoff accumulation. We\u2019re in the sign of strength phase. Last point support\u2026 we\u2019re going into phase E,\u201d he said, referencing classical technical accumulation structures. Still, despite the bullish setup, the analyst made clear he plans to de-risk between $8 and $13, emphasizing capital preservation after a potential 20x move from 50 cents. \u201cThe risk-to-reward on the downside is just too large at that point,\u201d he noted. \u201cEven if it goes significantly higher\u2026 anyone who\u2019s done a 20x on something should be taking some money off the table.\u201d He concluded the analysis with cautious optimism: \u201cDon\u2019t start counting your Lambos yet, but also probably start scrolling the magazine.\u201d For now, all eyes are on XRP\u2019s price action and Bitcoin\u2019s staying power above $111,000. If both confirm, as he put it: \u201cIt\u2019s game on.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.44. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

He further suggested that the rally will be similar to how XRP recorded an explosive surge in 2017, when it rallied from $0.0006 to $3.80. However, Jaydee doesn\u2019t expect this to happen. Instead, his accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could just rally to a conservative target of around $7 between August and September. This would still mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin. The crypto analyst also recently predicted a 50% \u201cmoonshot\u201d for the XRP price, which could send it to as high as $3.35 in the short term. A rally to $3.35 will bring the altcoin close to its current ATH of $3.80. It would also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. XRP Is Bullish On All Timeframes In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender declared that the XRP price is bullish on all timeframes for the first time since January 2025, when it reached its yearly high of $3.3. In another X post, the analyst stated that XRP is way ahead, having recorded a breakout above $2.33. With this breakout, he remarked that the altcoin\u2019s journey to its all-time high has begun.

Crypto analyst CasiTrades also highlighted how bullish the break above $2.30 was for XRP. She claimed that the altcoin could reach as high as $3.04 on this leg up.
