      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pump-fun-token-surges-in-pre-market-but-whales-are-shorting-it-why/",
      "summary": "As the official public sale of Pump.fun\u2019s token approaches, significant activity has emerged across decentralized derivatives exchanges, where large investors appear to be managing risk by taking early positions. Market data shows that whales are interacting with pre-market perpetual contracts, particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid and Binance, as they anticipate potential volatility during the token\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO), scheduled for July 12. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds \u2013 Details Perpetual Market Signals Whale Hedging Strategy Three prominent wallets have collectively deposited over $11 million in USDC on Hyperliquid to open short positions on the newly listed PUMP perpetual contract. These trades appear to function as hedges against anticipated allocations in the upcoming token generation event. According to on-chain tracker Lookonchain and explorer Hypurrscan, the structure of these positions, utilizing low leverage and modest open interest compared to margin collateral, suggests a defensive rather than speculative stance. One wallet, identified as \u201c0xAc72,\u201d allocated $4 million in margin and opened a 2x leveraged short valued at approximately $1.07 million at an entry price of $0.00504. This trader\u2019s liquidation point sits at $0.02138, offering a wide buffer that implies the position is less about profit from a downturn and more about offsetting potential downside risk from PUMP exposure in the ICO. Two additional wallets deployed a combined $7 million in margin to open 1x leveraged shorts. Together, these positions amount to roughly $2.39 million in open interest, a small portion of their posted collateral. Hyperliquid\u2019s open interest in PUMP has surpassed $43 million since listing the token in the early hours of Thursday\u2019s European session. Binance followed suit by listing a PUMP perpetual contract, which quickly amassed over $12 billion in trading volume, indicating heightened market anticipation. It is worth noting that the early trading could serve multiple purposes, including valuation locking by whales, arbitrage strategies related to expected airdrops, or speculative profit-taking based on retail momentum. Pump.fun Token Launch Nears as Pricing Premium Narrows The PUMP token initially debuted in pre-market trading at a roughly 40% premium to its ICO price of $0.004. It reached a high of $0.0056 on Hyperliquid before retreating to around $0.0047 levels, a level closer to its public sale valuation. The narrowing premium suggests a recalibration in investor expectations as trading stabilizes ahead of the launch. Pump.fun, a meme-coin launchpad built on Solana, announced the token in June alongside a revenue-sharing initiative for token holders. The token has a total supply of 1 trillion, with 33% allocated to early participants via a private sale (18%) and public sale (15%). The ICO will run from July 12 to July 15 on crypto exchange Bybit, providing a limited window for broader participation.
