      "summary": "Singapore-based trading desk QCP Capital says the options market is sending an unmistakable signal: large players are quietly positioning for a break to $130,000 by the end of Q3, even as spot Bitcoin languishes near $105,000. $130,000 Bitcoin Bets Heating Up In a note to clients on Wednesday, the firm highlighted \u201ca surprise uptick in job openings\u201d that lifted risk appetite across equities, nudging the S&#38;P 500 toward the psychologically charged 6,000 mark. \u201cA steady NFP would cement the Fed\u2019s narrative of a resilient labour market, reinforcing expectations that rates will remain on hold,\u201d QCP wrote, adding that front-end Bitcoin volatility has already \u201cslipped below 40 vol\u201d as traders park on the sidelines before Friday\u2019s payroll print. Despite the calm surface, options flows tell a livelier story. \u201cSeptember $130K calls were lifted at 47 vol,\u201d QCP observed, pointing to \u201cpockets of topside interest heading into Q3.\u201d With the one-month volatility term structure now flatter than at any point since May, opportunistic funds have found it inexpensive to buy long-dated vega while selling short-dated gamma. The dynamic mirrors a broader decline in equity volatility\u2014VIX is plumbing its own three-month lows\u2014and has left Bitcoin\u2019s implied curve looking \u201cwholly normalised,\u201d QCP noted, with skew suggesting \u201clittle directional conviction\u201d in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch That benign backdrop may not last. The desk warned that tariff frictions and Washington\u2019s so-called \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d could roil macro data just as the US debt-ceiling saga re-enters the headlines. \u201cIn the absence of a clear catalyst, BTC is unlikely to break materially out of its current range,\u201d the note said, but Q3 \u201ccould prove more challenging\u201d as fiscal risks and trade tensions \u201cintroduce potential headline volatility.\u201d China has already flashed early signs of stress: futures volumes in 10- and 30-year Chinese government bonds have fallen to their lowest levels since February, a fact QCP attributes to \u201cbroader risk aversion and sidelined positioning.\u201d Meanwhile, markets await any progress on an anticipated Xi-Trump dialogue\u2014an event that could shift sentiment on tariffs. For now, however, Bitcoin remains pinned. Spot has hugged the $105,000 handle for five straight sessions, open interest is light, and realized volatility has compressed into a mid-teens annualized band\u2014conditions that historically precede a sharp expansion. Whether that expansion resolves higher or lower hinges on the very catalysts traders are bracing for: payrolls data, central-bank rhetoric, and the tariff announcements that dominated headlines earlier in the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3\u20135 Year Holders Slow Selloff\u2014Waiting for Higher Prices? Yet the willingness of sophisticated desks to pay up for September upside is hard to ignore. A cluster of large prints in the $130,000 strike, executed at implied vols roughly seven points above the prevailing curve, suggests at least some investors expect Bitcoin to test new highs before month-end September. QCP stops short of endorsing the trade outright but underscores the asymmetry: \u201cWith vols crushed and skew flat, the cost of owning topside gamma has rarely looked this attractive,\u201d the firm writes. That calculus\u2014cheap optionality against a potentially volatile macro backdrop\u2014explains the growing divergence between spot lethargy and options optimism. If the payroll report arrives soft, the Fed pivot narrative could re-ignite; if tariff negotiations sour, Bitcoin\u2019s digital-gold appeal may resurface. Either path feeds volatility, and volatility is precisely what long-vega buyers are banking on. At press time, BTC traded at $104,648. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Despite recent volatility, several key indicators are pointing to a bullish undercurrent for Bitcoin (BTC). These include Binance\u2019s rising market dominance, renewed accumulation by long-term holders (LTH), and significant BTC withdrawals from major crypto exchanges. Bitcoin Showing Signs Of Renewed Strength At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading in the mid-$100,000 range &#8211; approximately 6.1% below its latest all-time high (ATH) recorded on May 22. The flagship cryptocurrency has declined more than 3.5% over the past seven days amid renewed concerns over global trade tensions and tariffs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest \u2013 Is A Second Wave Coming? However, according to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, several bullish signals have emerged since the start of June. Most notably, the LTH Net Position Realized Cap recently crossed the $20 billion threshold, reflecting increased confidence among seasoned investors. For context, LTHs are entities that have held BTC for over 155 days. Often referred to as &#8220;smart money,&#8221; these investors typically follow long-term strategies and are less likely to sell during short-term market corrections. The Realized Cap metric tracks the total value of BTC held by LTHs, based on the price at which coins were last moved. A rising value in this metric implies accumulation by long-term investors &#8211; behavior that historically precedes bullish continuation phases. Meanwhile, major exchanges such as Kraken and Bitfinex have witnessed substantial BTC outflows. Over two consecutive days, more than 20,000 BTC exited these platforms &#8211; marking one of the largest short-term withdrawal spikes in recent months. Such major Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are considered bullish because they signal that investors intend to hold their BTC in private wallets rather than sell it, reducing the available supply for trading. This supply contraction can create upward pressure on price, especially when demand remains steady or increases. At the same time, Binance has strengthened its lead in spot market dominance. Since early June, its share of BTC spot trading volume has increased from 26% to 35%, signalling growing market activity. This uptick aligns with BTC testing key resistance levels. Taha remarked: The convergence of rising exchange dominance, long-term holder confidence, and supply tightening paints a bullish picture for Bitcoin. While short-term corrections are possible, the underlying demand and reduction in available BTC on exchanges suggest that the uptrend is far from over. BTC Benefitting From Neutral Funding Rates, Low Selling Pressure Recent on-chain data shows that the BTC derivatives market has undergone a complete reset, with its funding rates now hovering around zero, not showing any directional bias. Similarly, selling pressure on BTC has remained subdued, evident from low Binance inflows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum \u2018Highly Likely\u2019 To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows That said, some caution is warranted. Fresh on-chain data suggests that cracks may be forming in the sustainability of the current bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $105,022, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "Cardi B\u2019s recent post about the meme token Wet A*s P*ssy (WAP) turned into a dramatic market shakeup. Within minutes, WAP\u2019s market cap plunged from $2 million to just $150,000. The token\u2019s price shot up to $0.0020 briefly, then tumbled over 90% back to $0.00019, wiping away almost all of this week\u2019s gains. Related Reading: Is $250K Bitcoin Possible This Year? This Research Chief Thinks So Celebrity Tweet Sparks Chaos According to reports, Cardi B shared a wallet address on her official X account with the caption \u201ceven wetter than last time.\u201d That single message sent ripples through the crypto world. Prices leaped, then crashed. Market watchers were left scratching their heads as billions of dollars in value seemed to vanish in mere moments. Suspicious Wallet Activity Blockchain trackers spotted something odd. A handful of wallets bought big chunks of WAP just five days before the tweet. They offloaded their tokens almost immediately after Cardi B\u2019s post, banking roughly 10 times their original stake. So today, @iamcardib remembered that she still held a large portion of the $WAP supply and decided to run another pump and dump. The token went from 2.5M to 139k a couple of minutes after the tweet The dump was triggered by some wallets that bought the token around five days\u2026 pic.twitter.com/7Nwr27rcZA \u2014 dethective (@dethective) June 3, 2025 These sudden sells helped push the token\u2019s price back down to around $0.00019. Based on reports, this pattern looks like a classic pump-and-dump. It raises questions about whether insiders planned the entire move. POV you might owe millions pic.twitter.com/j9FGLgoSBM \u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 4, 2025 History Of WAP Controversies This isn\u2019t the first time WAP caused trouble. Back in October 2024, Cardi B gave it a shout-out, and security firm PeckShield flagged the token for possible malicious deeds. That earlier buzz even led to an investigation by the UAE\u2019s Securities and Commodities Authority after investors raised alarms over fraud and market manipulation. Many in the crypto community thought everyone would steer clear this time. Instead, the past slipped from memory, leading to heavy losses all over again. Investors Left Holding The Bag In the last 24 hours, WAP\u2019s value dropped another 80%. Now it trades near the same levels it was at the end of May. Everyday traders who jumped on the hype found themselves staring at red numbers. Based on reports, some wallets walked away with tenfold returns in minutes. Meanwhile, others ended up with nearly worthless tokens. The speed of this rise-and-fall serves as a harsh reminder: if you buy a token right as it peaks, you might be stuck when the next crash hits.

      "summary": "Despite the recent rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,900, crypto analysts have warned that the Bitcoin price could still witness a massive crash that will send it below $100,000. These analysts highlighted fundamentals and technicals that could spark this price crash. Analysts Highlight Why Bitcoin Price Could Still Crash Below $100,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Stephan mentioned the geopolitical tensions, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifying as one of the factors that could spark the Bitcoin price crash. He explained how this conflict could drive investors toward safe-haven assets, such as gold. The analyst also noted that Bitcoin ETFs experienced modest outflows last week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $104,000: What You Need To Know In June Stephan\u2019s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could drop to as low as $96,765 as it retests the psychological $100,000 support level. Crypto analyst Nova also warned that Bitcoin could drop to $100,000 while providing a technical analysis of the flagship crypto\u2019s current price action. In a TradingView post, Nova stated that if the Bitcoin price faces resistance around the $106,406 daily level and continues to correct, it could extend the decline to retest the psychologically important $100,000 mark. She further revealed that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is at 53, trending downwards to the neutral level of 50. This indicates weakening bullish momentum. Nova also stated that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed a bearish crossover last week. Meanwhile, the analyst alluded to the increasing red histogram bars below the baseline, which she claimed further signal a potential correction ahead. Her accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could drop to $99,000 as it retests the $100,000 level. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also called for caution at the current Bitcoin price level. He stated that nothing has changed for the flagship crypto and indicated that there was no need to be ultra bullish at this current level. The analyst earlier warned that things could get sketchy looking for BTC if it fails to reclaim $106,800 soon enough. BTC Could Still Rally To $135,000 This Year In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price rallying to $135,000 this year. He noted that BTC has broken out of a right-angled descending broadening wedge, and if the price holds above the breakout zone, $135,000 becomes a realistic target. The analyst added that the structure is clean. Related Reading: Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Down Toward $95,000 Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that the Bitcoin price is gearing up for a new all-time high. He further remarked that $120,000 remains a magnet for the flagship crypto in this market cycle. Meanwhile, veteran trader Peter Brandt predicted that BTC could reach $150,000 by late summer 2025.
