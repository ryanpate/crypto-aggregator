      "summary": "XRP has been one of the most-watched altcoins recently, with multiple developments emerging for its parent company, Ripple. However, while Ripple has seen a lot of positives, XRP has continued to struggle when it comes to price. Amid the selling, bulls have put up an impressive fight to hold the support above $2.2 for the time being. This has led to the formation of a new inverse head and shoulders pattern that could signal a reversal is coming. Analyst Highlights Bullish Formation For XRP Price Crypto analyst TheSignalyst, in a new analysis, showed that the XRP price has begun another bullish formation. This time around, it is the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern that often precedes a surge for an asset. Not only has this formation come at a critical junction, it happened while bulls have maintained strong support levels. Related Reading: Altcoins Reclaim Trendline That Led To 2021 Explosion, Will History Repeat Itself? Through the market downtrend, the XRP price has been able to hold above $1.75 and $2, which the analyst points out as a major level. The return to this support level has brought a fresh wave of bullishness, and the XRP price could be ready for another uptrend from here. Presently, all eyes are on this support level, and TheSignalyst revealed that if XRP is able to hold this level, then the rally could be in motion. They point to the green neckline, which is shown in the chart as sitting just above $2.3, and this is the resistance that needs to be broken for the price to rally in the short term. For the long term, the analyst suggests that a clean break above the $2.66 level is needed. This is what would provide confirmation for a bullish continuation. If the setup holds, then the analyst puts the top of formation as high as $3.3 in the long term. Analysts Predict Higher Prices The calls for higher prices for XRP have grown louder, especially as investors have begun to make their bets once again. Analyst Crypto Virtuos pointed out that the XRP trading volume saw a notable uptick of 125% in a 24-hour period as interest ballooned once again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs? Analyst Explains The 2 Options Amid this rise in momentum, the crypto analyst, just like TheSignalyst, also explained that $2.3 is the hurdle that is holding the XRP price back now. Therefore, the cryptocurrency does need to overtake this level if it is to see a continuation of the uptrend. At the time of writing, the XRP price is still trending below $2.3, with sellers showing signs of exhaustion. Once the selling stops, then the bulls could trigger another upward wave to retest the resistance at $2.3 once again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price movement remains in focus as it continues to consolidate just below its previous all-time high. Despite a brief surge that brought it within range of its $111,000 peak, the asset has struggled to establish a breakout. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,927, representing a 0.2% increase over the past 24 hours. The persistence of this consolidation phase comes amid growing market discussions around spot and derivatives behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut\u2014What You Need To Know Binance Spot-Perpetual Delta Reflects Cautious Leverage One of the more notable on-chain observations comes from CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, who analyzed the prolonged negative delta between spot and perpetual prices on Binance. According to the analyst, this delta has remained in negative territory since December 2024. That means the spot price of Bitcoin has consistently traded above the perpetual futures price on Binance, an unusual structure during what appears to be a bullish market trend. \u201cWhen the delta flipped negative last December, Bitcoin had just marked a then-ATH,\u201d BorisVest noted. He explained that this divergence signaled an aggressive buildup of long positions in the perpetual market, just before Bitcoin corrected to $74,000. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs recently, the delta still hasn\u2019t reversed. \u201cThe sustained gap shows that leveraged traders have yet to commit to the rally in full,\u201d he added. This trend could indicate a phase of accumulation in the spot market, which historically precedes stronger price movements. The analyst also warned that when perpetual prices eventually flip above spot prices, it may signal a shift toward a more speculative environment. In such scenarios, sudden price corrections could occur if long positions are unwound rapidly. Traders monitoring the spot-perpetual relationship can potentially use this as a signal to adjust their risk exposure. Dollar Weakness May Signal Tailwinds for Bitcoin Another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a macroeconomic trend that could further influence Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, the weakening US dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the value of the dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies, is currently trading at its most significant deviation below its 200-day moving average in over two decades. This decline coincides with rising US debt levels and has historically aligned with strength in risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Darkfost pointed out that when the dollar loses its traditional safe-haven appeal, capital often flows toward alternative assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs? Analyst Explains The 2 Options \u201cHistorical data shows that these periods have consistently benefited Bitcoin,\u201d the analyst stated.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-ahead-dxy-breakdown-suggests-capital-shift-to-risk-on-assets/",
      "summary": "The US national debt recently hit a new all-time high (ATH), surging above $36.5 trillion and putting significant pressure on the US Dollar Index (DXY). As the DXY struggles under the weight of mounting debt, crypto analysts believe capital may soon shift to risk-on assets like Bitcoin (BTC). DXY Breakdown Suggests Bitcoin Rally According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, the DXY has dropped to a historically weak level, currently trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average (MA) &#8211; the largest deviation in the past 21 years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment For the uninitiated, the DXY measures the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies, including the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc. It is widely used as an indicator of USD strength or weakness and often influences investor sentiment across global financial markets. While a breakdown in the DXY might seem alarming at first, it historically benefits risk-on assets like BTC. A weakening dollar typically precedes capital rotation into alternative asset classes. Following that logic, the recent softness in the USD could prompt investors to reassess their portfolios &#8211; potentially increasing allocation to digital assets. Darkfost illustrated this point with the below chart. The chart highlights periods where the DXY traded below its 365-day MA. Historically, these phases have aligned with strong BTC price appreciation. The analyst added: We are currently in a phase where the weakness of the DXY could fuel a new rise in BTC but the price didn&#8217;t reacted yet. This tool serves as a valuable indicator for identifying early bull market phases and periods of euphoria, not because of pure technical triggers, but because it reflects increasing liquidity potentially flowing into crypto markets. According to data from CoingGecko, BTC is currently trading just about 2.2% below its ATH of $111,814 recorded on May 22. With BTC decisively breaking through a bullish flag, the flagship cryptocurrency looks set to hit a new ATH in the near-term. Some Warning Signs To Watch Out For Despite a favorable macro backdrop, several warning signs could dampen BTC\u2019s bullish momentum. For instance, Bitcoin\u2019s Apparent Demand metric has recently turned negative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Similarly, some on-chain metrics suggest that the BTC rally may be running out of steam. Bitcoin\u2019s NVT Golden Cross recently showed signs of a potential local top. That said, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, absorbing persistent selling pressure in the derivatives market and avoiding a breakdown below the $100,000 mark. At press time, BTC trades at $109,520, up 0.7% over the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Solana started a fresh increase above the $155 zone. SOL price is now consolidating gains and might struggle to rise above the $160 resistance. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $150 and $155 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $155 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $160 resistance zone. Solana Price Aims Higher Solana price started a decent increase after it cleared the $152 resistance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL climbed above the $155 level to enter a short-term positive zone. However, the price is facing a major hurdle at $160 and $162. A high is formed at $159.24 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $148 swing low to the $160 high. Solana is now trading above $155 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $155 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level. The next major resistance is near the $162 level. The main resistance could be $165. A successful close above the $165 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $178. Any more gains might send the price toward the $185 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $155 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $152 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $148 swing low to the $160 high. A break below the $152 level might send the price toward the $145 zone. If there is a close below the $145 support, the price could decline toward the $136 support in the near term.

      "summary": "Bitcoin continues to hover just below its previous all-time high, consolidating around the $109,000 mark despite a modest 1.9% gain over the past day. The asset reached a 7-day high of $110,307 but has yet to reclaim the historic high of $111,814, a level set back in May. While short-term price action remains within a tight range, on-chain data reveals deeper structural developments that could shape Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory in the weeks ahead. As attention focuses on Bitcoin&#8217;s potential for a breakout, some analysts are turning to supply dynamics for clues. One notable observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee, who has identified a significant reduction in BTC held on centralized exchanges. This trend may serve as a key indicator of future price behavior, especially in the context of institutional demand and exchange activity. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000\u2014Is History Repeating? Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drop to Multi-Year Lows Chairman Lee\u2019s analysis highlights a continued decline in exchange-held Bitcoin, with reserves falling to a multi-year low of 2.4 million BTC. This figure is down from over 3.1 million BTC reported in mid-2023. The consistent drawdown in exchange balances is interpreted as a signal that selling pressure is decreasing, which historically has preceded price expansions. According to Lee, \u201cThis persistent decline in reserve levels suggests that sell-side liquidity is drying up\u2026 Historically, such conditions\u2014where BTC held on exchanges is low\u2014precede major bullish expansions as demand exceeds supply.\u201d In past market cycles, including the 2020\u20132021 bull run, similar drops in exchange reserves were followed by sharp upward movements in Bitcoin\u2019s price. The logic is based on basic supply-demand mechanics: when available BTC becomes scarce on exchanges, any increase in demand, particularly from ETFs or institutional buyers, can lead to accelerated price growth. Lee emphasizes that this current trend could act as a foundational tailwind, potentially supporting further gains if current demand patterns remain in place. Binance Dominates Whale Transaction Flows Another piece of the market structure puzzle comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, who examined large-scale BTC transactions across major centralized exchanges. According to his report, Binance has maintained its position as the dominant venue for Bitcoin whale activity. Whale flows are defined in this context as daily inflows or outflows exceeding 1,000 BTC. Binance has recorded cumulative whale inflows of 31.36 million BTC and outflows of 30.82 million BTC, along with 53.2 million whale transactions, significantly more than any other exchange. Notably, these numbers do not reflect unique BTC, but rather total flow volumes that include repeated movements of the same coins. High transaction volumes suggest Binance is favored for its liquidity and infrastructure, allowing whales to engage in trading, custody shifts, and arbitrage with minimal friction.

The data also places HTX Global and Kraken in the second and third positions, respectively, for whale inflows, though their volumes are substantially lower than Binance\u2019s.
