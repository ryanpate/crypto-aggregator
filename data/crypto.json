      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-3400-on-chain-no-big-hurdles-ahead/",
      "summary": "On-chain data suggests Ethereum doesn&#8217;t face any dominant resistance levels until $3,417, something that could open up the path to the mark. Ethereum Cost Basis Distribution Shows Resistance Ahead Is More Spread Out In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the Cost Basis Distribution is looking for Ethereum right now. The &#8220;Cost Basis Distribution&#8221; is an indicator that tells us about how much of the asset&#8217;s supply was last purchased at which price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back At $109,000, But HODLer Profit-Taking Down 89% First, here is a chart that shows what the cryptocurrency&#8217;s latest breakout has been like from the perspective of this indicator: As displayed in the above graph, Ethereum has managed to break through a few notable supply levels with the latest price surge. Both the $2,700 and $2,740 levels hold the cost basis of about 1.3 million ETH, while the $2,760 mark holds that of 800,000 ETH. In on-chain analysis, levels concentrated with supply are considered important, due to the simple fact that investors are likely to show a reaction to price interactions with their cost basis. When this retest occurs from below, the holders may react by selling their coins. Loss investors can be desperate to get back into the green, so when the price does return to their break-even, they can panic and exit out of fear that they will go back underwater in the near future. Naturally, the more investors that share their cost basis at a particular level, the stronger this kind of selling reaction tends to be. As such, levels above that hold a significant amount of supply can act as resistance barriers to ETH&#8217;s price. Ethereum was earlier stuck under the aforementioned supply zones for a month, potentially because of this resistance effect, but now the cryptocurrency has finally reclaimed them. Just like how strong levels above can pose resistance, those below can be a center of support instead. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the role of the $2,700, $2,740, and $2,760 supply walls would now change. &#8220;These investors accumulated during consolidation and now will potentially form a strong support zone,&#8221; notes Glassnode. The support effect can arise from holders carrying a bullish mindset and looking at declines to their cost basis as dip-buying opportunities, or simply from them wanting to protect their acquisition boundary. Now, here is another chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the Ethereum Cost Basis Distribution looks for the levels ahead of the latest spot value: From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the levels ahead have the Ethereum supply distributed in a more uniform manner, with no strong clusters present until $3,417. More specifically, the price levels before this mark contain 200,000 to 400,000 ETH at every $50 gap. In comparison, the $3,417 level currently holds the cost basis of about 607,950 ETH.

ETH Price Ethereum briefly broke above $2,830 in the past day, but the coin has since faced a pullback as it&#8217;s back at $2,780.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge hasn\u2019t stopped warnings of a steep drop. After rising 1.87% in 24 hours and 3.61% over the past week, Bitcoin trades near $109,192. According to Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, these gains could be setting up the biggest crash in years. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Crash Scenario Outlined According to Brandt\u2019s analysis, Bitcoin could plunge by as much as 75%. If that happens, today\u2019s $109,800 price would fall to roughly $27,290. That level takes us back to the lows of early 2023. It would wipe out a huge chunk of value, reversing more than two years of gains. Few investors have models ready for such a steep slide. Historical Parallels With 2022 Based on reports, Brandt sees a replay of the 2022 chart. Back then, Bitcoin hit tops of $65K in April 2021 and $69K in November 2021. It then fell sharply into the bear market, losing more than half its value. Is Bitcoin $BTC following its 2022 script and setting up for a 75% correction? Doesn&#8217;t hurt to ask this, does it? pic.twitter.com/BAywkhSwgy \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 10, 2025 This time around, the world&#8217;s top crypto formed highs above $108,000 in December 2024 and January 2025, then dropped under $100,000. After recovering near $112,000 last month, BTC may be gearing up for a similar breakdown. Trigger Points To Watch Key technical markers are flashing red. The 9-period EMA has just crossed below the 21-period EMA on the daily chart. In past sell-offs, that crossover marked the start of big downtrends. Traders will want to see if Bitcoin closes below both EMAs for a week or more. A failure to reclaim the $108,000 level could be the final trigger before panic sets in. Market Reactions And Risks Derivatives data is mixed but leans bearish. Trading volume jumped almost 30% to $100 billion, while open interest rose 1%. On Binance and OKX, the long/short ratios sit at about 0.5501 and 0.53, showing more shorts than longs. When too many people bet on a drop, a squeeze can follow\u2014if the crash doesn\u2019t start soon. Still, the current crowding could backfire if Bitcoin holds above support.

That may sound big, but it\u2019s under 0.2% of the roughly $50 billion assets under management. By contrast, Ethereum products attracted $295 million. So while some money is leaving Bitcoin, it\u2019s shifting around inside crypto rather than fleeing entirely. For now, Bitcoin sits at a crossroads. Will it break support and roll over toward the mid-$20,000s? Or will it shake off warnings and press higher? Either way, traders need to watch the $108,000 zone closely. According to Brandt, a 75% drop could catch unprepared investors off guard. Managing risk and keeping orders tight seems more critical now than ever.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-to-all-time-highs-above-4/",
      "summary": "The XRP price is turning bullish once again, with new technical analysis indicating that the altcoin could be on track for a fresh All-Time High (ATH). As the price moves toward breaking key resistance levels, analysts are calling for a potential surge above $4. Alongside this outlook, they have provided detailed trading guidance and identified the ideal timeframe for investors to consider taking profits. Master Ananda, a prominent TradingView analyst, has reported that XRP is currently showing strong technical signs of a bullish breakout that could lead to new all-time highs above $4.5. Despite experiencing a months-long downtrend, the cryptocurrency appears to be entering a powerful new growth phase that could bring its price significantly higher than previous ATH levels around $3.84. XRP Price Eyes Huge ATH Breakout Above $4.5 Notably, the TradingView analyst points to the bottom of a recent correction forming on April 7, with a peak established on May 12. This was followed by a 24-day retracement phase that ended on June 5, when XRP formed a higher low. Based on these price movements, Master Ananda notes that it\u2019s been approximately 27 days since XRP last saw bullish price action, marking almost an entire month of consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Wave Structure Predicts Wild Fluctuations On Its Way To $4 ATH Nevertheless, the analyst highlights that the recent confirmation candle on June 8 supports the expectation that XRP is resuming its upward trajectory. The analyst\u2019s chart illustrates a clear breakout from a descending trendline, followed by a shift into an ascending channel. This formation, paired with substantial volume activity and a bullish price structure, signals a possibly strong rally for XRP. Fibonacci levels drawn on the chart suggest that XRP could reach a near-term target of $4.5 (1.618 Fob) after surpassing upper resistance levels at $2.71 and $3.019. The chart also shows a potential for XRP to exceed this initial $4.5 level to reach $6.29 (2.618 Fib). Notably, Master Ananda predicts that XRP could reach a peak before most assets this cycle, as its bullish momentum had an early start with a historic run from $0.5 to slightly above $3 this year. The analyst also forecasts that once XRP reaches the top, a significant correction could follow, potentially marking the end of the current bullish setup. Analyst Unveils Trading Strategy And Take Profit Zone Beyond short-term price action, Master Ananda outlines a broader trading strategy focused on holding through the current growth wave. Rather than taking incremental profits around the $2.71 and $3.02 price highs, the analyst recommends that traders maintain a full position until XRP hits the $4.5 target and take-profit zone. Related Reading: Wave Structure Puts XRP Price In The $18.22-$23.20 Range In The Short Term This approach is designed to capture the maximum upside potential of this bullish cycle without diluting gains through early exits. Once XRP reaches this level, the analyst suggests taking profit partially\u2014-not to exit entirely but to prepare capital for a potential redeployment during the next market retracement. Master Ananda also positions XRP as a lead indicator in what could be an extended altcoin bull market. A breakout above $4.5 will likely trigger explosive growth in lower-cap cryptocurrencies. While XRP is expected to generate up to 50% gains, these assets, according to the TradingView analyst, have the potential to yield returns of 150% in a single day.

      "summary": "SUI has quickly become a standout performer in the crypto market, posting a dramatic 150% gain from $1.71 to $4.30. Yet, not all is smooth sailing. A $215 million token unlock on June 1, 2025, threatens to introduce major selling pressure. Volatility Meets Opportunity: SUI Charts A Risk-Reward Path According to SirRichard\u2019s latest update on X, SUI has exhibited notable price swings, but its long-term outlook remains firmly bullish. The token recently pulled off a remarkable 150% rally, climbing from a low of $1.71 to a high of $4.30. This explosive move caught the attention of traders, especially as it coincided with a golden cross formation on the daily chart, a classic technical signal that often precedes major bullish continuation. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View Based on this setup, SirRichard believes SUI could be preparing for an even more significant leg up, potentially targeting new highs around the $7.56 mark. If this plays out, it would represent a staggering 380% gain from earlier levels. However, he also warned that the journey may not be without obstacles, particularly as other technical and fundamental signals begin to surface. A recent bearish crossover in the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) may hinder SUI\u2019s bullish momentum in the short term. Additionally, the token unlock on June 1, 2025, resulting in the release of approximately $215 million worth of SUI into circulation, poses a potential risk. Such a large supply event could introduce selling pressure and spark short-term volatility if not absorbed smoothly by the market. Currently, immediate support lies between $3.40 and $3.43, which could act as a cushion in the event of a dip. On the upside, resistance is building around the $3.50\u2013$4.00 zone. A firm break above this level would reignite bullish momentum, paving the way for SUI\u2019s next upward surge. Bearish Winds Loom, But On-Chain Strength Holds Ground On the other hand, if bearish sentiment intensifies, the price could fall toward the $2.33 level, a key support that could be tested. Such a move would likely challenge bullish confidence and introduce volatility in the near term. Related Reading: Here\u2019s Why SUI At $3.61 Could Be the Calm Before A Parabolic Surge Despite this, the broader outlook is supported by impressive network activity. SUI\u2019s ecosystem has seen over $40 billion in aggregator volume, a significant metric pointing to strong participation and interest. Even more encouraging is the 24% increase in activity over the last 30 days, highlighting a growing user base and rising utility. These fundamentals serve as a strong counterbalance to short-term risks. If sustained, they could provide a firm foundation for renewed bullish momentum. As such, any price dip may offer a fresh opportunity for long-term investors. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"

To efekt rosn\u0105cego zapotrzebowania na rozwi\u0105zania, kt\u00f3re rozszerzaj\u0105 funkcjonalno\u015b\u0107 Bitcoina bez naruszania jego podstawowych zasad bezpiecze\u0144stwa. Bitcoin Hyper to druga warstwa Bitcoina zbudowana na maszynie wirtualnej Solany, kt\u00f3ra dzia\u0142a w po\u0142\u0105czeniu z bazow\u0105 warstw\u0105 BTC. Taka konstrukcja pozwala uzyska\u0107 ponad 2 tysi\u0105ce transakcji na sekund\u0119, zachowuj\u0105c przy tym odporno\u015b\u0107 na manipulacje oraz decentralizacj\u0119. U\u017cytkownicy mog\u0105 realizowa\u0107 szybkie przelewy, korzysta\u0107 z aplikacji zdecentralizowanych, a tak\u017ce uczestniczy\u0107 w nowych formach aktywno\u015bci, takich jak staking czy zdecentralizowany handel. Mechanizm dzia\u0142ania sieci Bitcoin Hyper System opiera si\u0119 na transparentnym modelu. U\u017cytkownik deponuje BTC w inteligentnym kontrakcie, kt\u00f3ry weryfikuje transakcj\u0119 na podstawie danych z \u0142a\u0144cucha blok\u00f3w. Nast\u0119pnie sie\u0107 emituje r\u00f3wnowa\u017cny token, mo\u017cliwy do wykorzystania w ekosystemie Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER). Po zako\u0144czeniu aktywno\u015bci u\u017cytkownik mo\u017ce spali\u0107 token i odzyska\u0107 oryginalne BTC. W tle dzia\u0142aj\u0105 dowody zerowej wiedzy oraz weryfikacja danych przez light clients. U\u017cytkownik przesy\u0142a bitcoiny do inteligentnego kontraktu, kt\u00f3ry potwierdza transakcj\u0119 na podstawie danych z sieci g\u0142\u00f3wnej. Po weryfikacji powstaje r\u00f3wnowa\u017cny token w sieci Hyper, gotowy do dalszego wykorzystania. Kiedy u\u017cytkownik chce wycofa\u0107 \u015brodki, token zostaje uniewa\u017cniony, a oryginalne Bitcoiny wracaj\u0105 do w\u0142a\u015bciciela. Ca\u0142y proces odbywa si\u0119 z u\u017cyciem zaawansowanych metod kryptograficznych, kt\u00f3re zapewniaj\u0105 bezpiecze\u0144stwo i zgodno\u015b\u0107 z g\u0142\u00f3wnym \u0142a\u0144cuchem bez konieczno\u015bci anga\u017cowania po\u015brednik\u00f3w. W\u0142a\u015bciciele tokena $HYPER mog\u0105 korzysta\u0107 z produkt\u00f3w o podwy\u017cszonym zwrocie, zyska\u0107 dost\u0119p do zaawansowanych narz\u0119dzi oraz uczestniczy\u0107 w dalszym rozwoju projektu. Tw\u00f3rcy aplikacji maj\u0105 szans\u0119 uzyska\u0107 dofinansowanie i zwroty koszt\u00f3w op\u0142at sieciowych, je\u015bli zdecyduj\u0105 si\u0119 wykorzystywa\u0107 $HYPER w swoich kontraktach. Dane z rynku potwierdzaj\u0105 skuteczno\u015b\u0107 modelu Bitcoin Hyper Podobne projekty ju\u017c wcze\u015bniej osi\u0105ga\u0142y znacz\u0105ce wyniki. Arbitrum zgromadzi\u0142o ponad 13 miliard\u00f3w dolar\u00f3w warto\u015bci zablokowanej oraz ponad milion aktywnych portfeli. Sie\u0107 Base, powi\u0105zana z Coinbase, przekroczy\u0142a warto\u015b\u0107 2,5 miliarda dolar\u00f3w i notuje ponad milion aktywnych adres\u00f3w dziennie. Dane te to dow\u00f3d na to, \u017ce dobrze zaprojektowane sieci drugiej warstwy mog\u0105 szybko zdobywa\u0107 rynek i u\u017cytkownik\u00f3w. Bitcoin Hyper ma potencja\u0142, \u017ceby powt\u00f3rzy\u0107 ten sukces i sta\u0107 si\u0119 jedn\u0105 z najlepszych przedsprzeda\u017cy kryptowalut. Ca\u0142kowita poda\u017c token\u00f3w zosta\u0142a ustalona na 21 miliard\u00f3w, bez alokacji dla uprzywilejowanych grup. Obecnie trwa przedsprzeda\u017c tokena $HYPER, a jeden z wi\u0119kszych inwestor\u00f3w naby\u0142 niedawno tokeny za r\u00f3wnowarto\u015b\u0107 55 tysi\u0119cy dolar\u00f3w. Tego rodzaju ruchy ze strony du\u017cych graczy cz\u0119sto prognozuj\u0105 wi\u0119ksze zmiany. Nowa rola Bitcoina w cyfrowym \u015bwiecie Rozw\u00f3j Rezerwy Strategicznej oraz wdro\u017cenie sieci Hyper to dwa bieguny tej samej zmiany. Z jednej strony wida\u0107 instytucjonalizacj\u0119 zasob\u00f3w cyfrowych. Z drugiej pojawiaj\u0105 si\u0119 narz\u0119dzia, kt\u00f3re poszerzaj\u0105 zakres ich u\u017cycia. Bitcoin przestaje pe\u0142ni\u0107 jedynie funkcj\u0119 przechowywania warto\u015bci. Staje si\u0119 \u015brodowiskiem operacyjnym dla ca\u0142ych aplikacji, us\u0142ug i produkt\u00f3w nowej generacji. Bitcoin Hyper wnosi do sieci Bitcoina funkcjonalno\u015b\u0107, kt\u00f3rej dot\u0105d brakowa\u0142o. Dzi\u0119ki nowej warstwie technicznej mo\u017cliwe staj\u0105 si\u0119 szybkie transakcje, obs\u0142uga aplikacji finansowych, zdecentralizowanych projekt\u00f3w i rozwi\u0105za\u0144 opartych na inteligentnych kontraktach. Sie\u0107 zyskuje skal\u0119, kt\u00f3rej wymaga nowoczesna gospodarka cyfrowa. Bitcoin nie pe\u0142ni ju\u017c wy\u0142\u0105cznie roli cyfrowego magazynu warto\u015bci. W po\u0142\u0105czeniu z Bitcoin Hyper przechodzi transformacj\u0119 w platform\u0119 operacyjn\u0105 dla szerszego ekosystemu finansowego. Mo\u017ce wspiera\u0107 codzienne zastosowania, przep\u0142ywy kapita\u0142u, tworzenie nowych us\u0142ug oraz rozwi\u0105za\u0144 dla u\u017cytkownik\u00f3w i firm. Kup Bitcoin Hyper"
