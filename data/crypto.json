      "summary": "Crypto-market commentator \u201cQuantum Ascend\u201d devoted a 8 June video to a single idea: the price structure that once catapulted Ethereum Classic to its bull-market peak is about to do the same for Cardano\u2014and could deliver a twenty-fold advance if history \u201crhymes rather than repeats.\u201d Speaking to his followers, the analyst opened by noting that ADA\u2019s weekly chart \u201clooks so similar\u201d to the multi-year pattern that preceded Ethereum Classic\u2019s vertical move in early 2021. \u201cThey have the same market makers,\u201d he asserted, pointing out that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson had early involvement in both projects. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a cheat code for this thing.\u201d Cardano Set For 2,000% Explosion To illustrate the parallel, Quantum Ascend overlaid the two assets\u2019 Elliott-wave counts. In his reading, Ethereum Classic completed its fifth impulsive wave during the last cycle, whereas Cardano is \u201cwaiting on that fifth wave\u201d after a prolonged flag-shaped consolidation. He then dropped a Fibonacci retracement on Ethereum Classic\u2019s 2020\u201321 third-to-fourth-wave segment, showing the final thrust topped out \u201cjust shy of the 2.36\u201d\u2014and repeated the exercise on Cardano\u2019s current structure, which has advanced to the same proportional level. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut you guys see how similar these structures are.\u201d A second Fibonacci projection, stretching Cardano\u2019s initial three-wave span to a full 1.618 extension, points to a conservative target \u201cup around four bucks,\u201d he said. But a more ambitious extrapolation of Ethereum Classic\u2019s 3.618 climax would propel ADA into a zone between roughly 10.67 and 12.55\u2014an area he calls his \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d objectives. From the current price such a run would exceed 2,000 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s violent,\u201d he remarked after flicking his cursor to the comparative surge on the ETC chart. \u201cHopefully you can see how clean this is, because I feel really good about Cardano getting up into that $10 level.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Turns Upward \u2014 Signs of a Recovery Emerge Quantum Ascend argued that the temporal spacing is also lining up. Ethereum Classic\u2019s listing in August 2016 meant its multiyear base completed roughly four and a half years later; Cardano\u2019s analogous base, begun in late 2017, is now of similar duration, though \u201cthe whole chart has taken a little bit longer on the consolidation.\u201d For him, that extension merely \u201cloads the spring\u201d for a sharper repricing once last season begins in earnest. The analyst did allow for interim turbulence. In his scenario, ADA could hit the former all-time-high region around $3.12, \u201creject back down to $1.67\u201d during a broader market-wide wave-four shake-out, and only then launch into a blow-off toward the upper Fibonacci cluster. Still, even that corrective loop reinforces the fractal: \u201cOver here with Ethereum Classic it got to its last all-time high, rejected, and then went on one more big run.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano Price Woes To Continue? Analyst Expects ADA To Fall To $0.47 Quantifying his own risk appetite, Quantum Ascend told viewers he is \u201cpretty hyped on Cardano\u201d and wants the token \u201cin my portfolio because it is one of my higher-conviction plays for what\u2019s about to happen here.\u201d He concluded by sketching three tiers of price objectives\u2014$4.90 (conservative), $10.67 (primary) and $12.45 (secondary). Whether altseason\u2019s starting gun fires as cleanly as the fractal implies remains to be seen, but Quantum Ascend\u2019s thesis hinges on a single proposition: when the same market makers move two historically linked assets through mirror-image patterns, ignoring the setup may prove costlier than betting against it. At press time, ADA traded at $0.59. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-outperforming-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "With one week already gone in the month of July, Ethereum has already begun to perform better than Bitcoin. While the gap is still very close, the outperformance of Ethereum over Bitcoin for only the second time this year could signal the entrance of better things for the altcoin market. If this continues, then an altcoin season might be on the horizon, as historical data shows it always begins with ETH outperforming BTC. So, let\u2019s take a look at how both assets have been performing. Ethereum Barrels Ahead Of Bitcoin In July So far, in the month of July, the Ethereum price has been putting in more green candles, suggesting that bulls are making their move again. This has led to a small outperformance when compared to the Bitcoin price over this time period and could be the signal that altcoin season could be starting soon. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could See 180% Explosion As This Indicator Flashes Bullish Divergence Data from the CryptoRank website shows that Ethereum is already up more than 2.50% since the start of July. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price, while having seen some price increases, is up only 1.20% at the time of this writing. Thus, Ethereum is already performing better in the month of July. If this outperformance continues, then this would be only the second time that the Ethereum price will be doing better than the Bitcoin price so far in 2025. The first was back in May, when the Ethereum price rallied by over 41% in one month. This was major compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 11.1% move in that month. However, while the Bitcoin rally in the month of May saw its price reach new all-time highs, Ethereum continues to struggle and remains below its $4,800 all-time high levels. Nevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s rally did translate to bullishness for the altcoin market as the likes of PEPE and BONK rallied by more than 100% in response to this. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here\u2019s The Target Given that Ethereum has led the altcoin season in the past, its outperformance of Bitcoin at this level remains a positive. If it continues, then the altcoin market could start to see further increases in price. And if Ethereum rises another 41% from here, it would put it right on the path to $4,000. However, the month of July has not historically been the best month for Ethereum, with an average return of +5.13%. The whole of the third quarter of the year is also a mixed bag for the altcoin, with an equal number of green and red closes over the last decade. Thus, it remains to be seen how the ETH price will perform this quarter and if it can successfully outpace Bitcoin. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "As the crypto market moves sideways, Solana (SOL) compresses between two key levels. Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is about to break out and reclaim a crucial resistance level, which could trigger the long-awaited retest of the $200 barrier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back In \u2018Retesting Phase\u2019 After Key Level Reclaim \u2013 The Calm Before The Storm? Solana Holds Key Support After recovering from last month\u2019s downtrend, Solana has been attempting to reclaim the crucial $160 level to continue its bullish rally. The cryptocurrency traded between the $140-$180 range for two months, but briefly lost its post-breakout range in late June. Two weeks ago, SOL fell below the $130 area, hitting a two-month low of $126 on June 22. Since then, the altcoin has recovered, fueled by last week\u2019s launch of a Solana staked crypto Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US by Rex Shares. Following the news, Solana\u2019s price jumped toward the $160 resistance level but was rejected, hovering between the $145-$155 price range for the past week. On Tuesday, SOL fell below the $150 level, hitting the $147 support before bouncing. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that the $147.59 area is one of the most important support levels for Solana, as losing this level could trigger a pullback to the next key zone around the $141 mark. Similarly, market watcher Man of Bitcoin affirmed that SOL\u2019s key support to maintain is around $141.91, adding that \u201ca sustained break below this level would suggest that wave-C of (ii) is already underway.\u201d The analyst previously warned that there is a potential scenario \u201cwith one more low in wave-5,\u201d if the cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t hold about the $148 mark. However, maintaining this support would build a base to target the local highs. SOL About To Retest $160? Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show affirmed that SOL is \u201cabout to break off\u201d a triangle formation and test the $162 resistance. As the price compresses between the upper and lower boundaries, the analyst suggested that the cryptocurrency\u2019s breakout is around the corner. Notably, Solana has been forming a one-week symmetrical triangle pattern in the daily chart. If the cryptocurrency successfully breaks above the $152-$153 zone, it could see a 10.87% jump toward the technical target of $167. The Cryptonomist highlighted that SOL broke out of a multi-day diagonal resistance on Sunday, which was retested and confirmed as support after bouncing around the $147 twice since the breakout. Related Reading: 50% Bitcoin Price Crash On The Horizon? Analyst Reveals $60,000 Target The analyst considers that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a continuation of its rally, targeting the one-week high and resistance of $160. Meanwhile, Crypto Jelle noted that despite the April downside deviation, Solana continues to trade within its $125-$180 Macro Range, currently hovering around the mid-range. To him, \u201cit looks like it&#8217;s just waiting for BTC to break out. Once it reclaims $160, $200 should come quickly. Above there, new all-time highs are within reach.\u201d As of this writing, Solana is trading at $151.51, a 3.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the Binance Exchange Reserve has diverged between Bitcoin and the stablecoins. Here&#8217;s what this could mean for the market. Bitcoin &#38; Stablecoin Exchange Reserves Have Decoupled On Binance In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binance Exchange Reserve for Bitcoin and the stablecoins. The &#8220;Exchange Reserve&#8221; here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that&#8217;s sitting on the wallets attached to a centralized exchange. When the value of this metric rises, it means the holders are making net deposits of the asset to the platform. Generally, investors use exchanges when they want to participate in trading activities, so them making inflows could signal appetite for trading the coin away. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit 8-Week Streak\u2014Institutions Still Buying For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally have a bearish impact on the price. The same, however, isn&#8217;t true in the case of the stablecoins, as they are, by definition, always stable around the same value as the fiat currency that they are pegged to. Investors usually store their capital in the form of these tokens when they want to avoid the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin. Many of them, however, plan to eventually return back to the volatile side. Once they have decided to make the switch, they transfer their stablecoins to exchanges. When they make the swap to a coin like Bitcoin, its price naturally observes a buying boost. As such, stablecoin inflows can be bullish for the volatile cryptocurrencies. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Exchange Reserve of Binance for Bitcoin and the stablecoins over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Binance Exchange Reserve for the two asset classes showed some correlation in 2024. But by the end of the year, a shift had occurred, with the stablecoins witnessing sharp inflows and Bitcoin outflows. The two have remained decoupled in 2025 so far, although their trends no longer diverge as extremely. The stablecoin Binance exchange reserve has recently been trending sideways, while the one for Bitcoin has rapidly been moving down. Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Thus, it would appear that there is a large amount of fiat-tied tokens on the exchange potentially waiting to be deployed into the volatile side and at the same time, investors are also pulling out BTC supply, hinting at ongoing accumulation. This could hint at bullish conditions aligning on the largest cryptocurrency exchange, but it only remains to be seen whether the setup would reflect in the Bitcoin price or not.
