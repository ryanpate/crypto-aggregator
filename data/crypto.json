Based on reports, only qualified investors will be allowed to trade on the MOEX. That means big banks, funds, and other approved financial groups can take part. Ordinary investors won\u2019t get in on these deals. The Bank of Russia gave the green light in May 2025 for such products, but it still warns most firms to steer clear of direct crypto deals. The idea seems to be to let big players handle the risk in a controlled way. Local Settlements Keep Risk In Rubles Moscow Exchange decided to price the contracts in US dollars. However, when it\u2019s time to settle, everything happens in rubles. This approach protects Russia from sudden swings in foreign markets. A trader can lock in a deal based on Bitcoin\u2019s value in dollars, yet get paid in their home currency. It\u2019s a setup that keeps money inside Russia even as it ties to a global crypto product.

It approved crypto-linked derivatives for qualified investors, but it hasn\u2019t opened the door for everyone. Most banks and investment firms are told not to put their clients into direct Bitcoin trades. Instead, they can offer tools like these futures if they qualify. This reflects a watchful stance on digital assets. Authorities acknowledge the lure of big profits, but they also want to avoid big losses. By keeping access limited, they hope to keep any trouble contained.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-2017-fractal-reappearing/",
      "summary": "XRP&#8217;s price action is currently exhibiting a back-and-forth pattern around $2.20, but an interesting technical analysis suggests it may soon leave this price level. A chart analysis posted by a crypto analyst on the social media platform X has given an interesting projection about XRP\u2019s next move. By overlaying XRP\u2019s current weekly chart with its explosive 2017 fractal, the analyst hints that the altcoin might be on the verge of a repeat performance that sends it far beyond its current price range. 2017 XRP Fractal Overlaid Technical analysis of XRP price action on the weekly timeframe reveals an interesting pattern that has been unfolding over multiple weeks. This interesting pattern began with the intense XRP price rally in Q4 2024, which eventually ended in a consolidation around $2, as seen in the current price action. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a flag pattern that is still playing out. Related Reading: Analyst Shows 3-Cycle Ride For XRP Price To Reach $46 The core of the analyst&#8217;s technical analysis lies in the uncanny resemblance between XRP\u2019s present market structure and the bullish pattern that preceded the historic 2017 rally. As such, the analyst overlaid the 2017 fractal onto the current price action, revealing a formation that mirrors a giant bull flag, which is often interpreted as a technical continuation pattern. The analysis also places into focus XRP\u2019s ongoing interaction with the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) on the weekly candlestick timeframe. Back in 2017, this level acted as a support base for XRP\u2019s vertical breakout. Now, the current pattern shows the cryptocurrency is once again consolidating directly above this moving average, which the analyst describes as the foundation of a giga bull flag. The resemblance doesn\u2019t stop at price structure. The analyst also draws attention to the RSI behavior. Back in 2017, the RSI entered a flat compressed zone between two spikes on the weekly timeframe, a pattern that appears to be repeating today. The first RSI peak has already formed, and the current flattening phase suggests a possible second spike may soon follow, which could correlate with a breakout in price if the fractal stays valid. What To Expect If 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? The implications are exciting if XRP follows the same trajectory as it did in 2017. The overlay suggests a price rally beyond $20, which would represent the biggest rally so far in XRP&#8217;s price history. The projected move would take XRP far beyond its 2018 all-time high of $3.40 and establish a new price floor above double digits for the cryptocurrency. This projection aligns with other projections in similar technical analyses from other cryptocurrency analysts. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Now Targeting $4 After Reversal From \u2018Buy Zone\u2019 At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.2, down by 2,3% in the past 24 hours.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-analyst-warns-this-bitcoin-bull-cycle-looks-nothing-like-2017-or-2021/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to show signs of consolidation following its all-time high of over $111,000 recorded in May. At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $104,851, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours and roughly 6.3% below its recent peak. This period of relative price stability comes amid cautious sentiment across the broader crypto market, as analysts examine whether the current bull cycle is beginning to shift gears or simply experiencing a temporary pause. CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan has released a comparative analysis of current and past market cycles, noting several distinct behaviors in Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action. Drawing parallels to the bull runs of 2017 and 2021, Dan suggests that while similarities exist, the current cycle has developed unique characteristics. These changes could signal a different structure in how the market plays out, particularly in terms of timing and investor participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Comparing Bitcoin Cycles: 2024\u20132025 Diverges from Historical Patterns According to Dan, previous cycles saw more predictable corrections and rallies. In 2017, Bitcoin experienced relatively short corrections before entering a prolonged rally that concluded in late December of that year. The 2021 cycle, affected early on by the COVID-19 pandemic, featured a longer initial correction before a strong upward surge. In both cases, once Bitcoin gained momentum, corrections became less frequent and shorter in duration. The current cycle, spanning 2024\u20132025, has so far been marked by alternating strong rallies and sudden declines, often occurring over short timeframes. These patterns have dampened broader market sentiment, particularly during periods when altcoins significantly underperformed Bitcoin. Dan posits that these repeated pullbacks may not be purely organic. Instead, they could indicate intentional suppression by large players aiming to extend the cycle\u2019s duration and prevent overheating. If this interpretation holds, the bull cycle could end not with a gradual fade, but a sharp spike driven by euphoric buying behavior. Retail Activity Declines as Institutions Drive Market Structure A separate analysis by CryptoQuant\u2019s Burak Kesmeci focuses on the behavior of retail investors since Bitcoin hit its $111,000 high in late May. Data shows that retail transfer volumes, transactions valued between $0 and $10,000, have decreased from $423 million to $408 million. Additionally, the 30-day change in retail demand has slipped into negative territory, shifting from +5 points to -0.11 points. This reduction in retail activity suggests that smaller investors remain sensitive to short-term volatility, stepping back in response to recent price corrections. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History\u2019s Turning Kesmeci argues that for the bull cycle to sustain momentum, consistent participation from retail segments is crucial. At present, institutional interest appears to be the primary source of demand. The divergence between these two investor classes may shape how the next leg of Bitcoin\u2019s market cycle develops.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-hash-ribbons-indicating-prime-buying-opportunity-analyst-says/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) remains range-bound in the mid-$100,000s, showing no clear directional bias. However, the Hash Ribbons indicator is now flashing a fresh buy signal, suggesting that the top cryptocurrency may be gearing up for its next upward move. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Ribbons are signalling a potential prime buying opportunity for the leading digital asset. This signal coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate reaching new all-time highs (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Giant Abandons Full-Hold Strategy, Unloads $40M In Crypto For the uninitiated, Bitcoin Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that analyzes miner stress by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average after a period of decline, it signals that miner capitulation is ending &#8211; often marking a strong long-term buying opportunity. Such signals can emerge when mining becomes unprofitable for certain miners, forcing them to sell their BTC holdings to stay afloat. These sell-offs may temporarily pressure the price, but historically they have created attractive long-term buying opportunities. In their analysis, Darkfost notes that while the current signal is bullish from a long-term perspective, it could lead to a short-term pullback in BTC price. However, he emphasizes that any dip should be viewed as a chance to accumulate. Darkfost also pointed out that the Hash Ribbons indicator has historically been reliable, with the exception of 2021 during the China mining ban. They shared the following chart illustrating how the indicator is currently showing a strong buy signal. Is BTC Headed For A Crash? While the Hash Ribbons suggest a favorable long-term setup, some analysts warn that the short-term correction could be deeper than expected. For instance, crypto analyst Xanrox used the Fibonacci levels to forecast that BTC may tumble as low as $98,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning Signs? Long-Term Holders Exit While Retail Buyers Rush In Similarly, analyst Jelle noted that Bitcoin may face \u201cone last speed bump\u201d before launching a major rally to $140,000. Meanwhile, more pessimistic voices continue to warn of a dramatic crash, with some speculating that BTC could fall below $10,000 &#8211; a view seen as increasingly unlikely by most market participants. Despite the varying predictions, fresh on-chain data points to a healthy BTC market in the near to medium term. For instance, CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently highlighted that the derivatives market has undergone a reset, with funding rates stabilizing around neutral levels. Similarly, Fundstrat\u2019s Head of Research, Tom Lee foresees BTC surging to as high as $250,000 by the end of the year. At press time, BTC trades at $105,367, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.
