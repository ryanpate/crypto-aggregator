      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent climb to $105,000 has done little to shake off the worries piling up around its momentum. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency eked out a 0.03% gain in the last 24 hours but still sits 3.5% lower than it did a week ago. According to analyst Captain Faibik, this mix of flat gains and fading strength could mean traders are buying Bitcoin at the top. Related Reading: Iran\u2019s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links\u2014Details Bearish RSI Divergence Signals Weakness Based on data, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has drifted downward after peaking near 80, even as Bitcoin\u2019s price pushed to fresh highs. The RSI now sits at 61.88, a clear sign that buyers are losing steam. Traders often watch for this kind of mismatch\u2014when price goes up but RSI goes down\u2014because it can spell a coming pullback. History shows it doesn\u2019t always lead to a crash, but it does make a correction more likely. After carving out fresh highs, it feels like Bitcoin has hit its ceiling, according to Fabik, and a pullback into the $92,000\u2013$94,000 zone could be on the cards. This setup usually sparks a quick correction, so many traders will be watching closely and tightening up their strategies as the market could shift in a hurry. $BTC is showing a massive RSI Bearish divergence on the weekly chart..!! It looks like Bitcoin has topped out and is now Ready for a major correction toward the 92\u201394k Range..\ud83d\udcc9 Just like it bottomed out at 16k in November 2022, We bought the dip and now we\u2019re selling the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/W25HCAxkIa \u2014 Captain Faibik \ud83d\udc3a (@CryptoFaibik) June 18, 2025 Resistance Levels Keep Price In Check Bitcoin has bumped into stiff barriers around $108,000 and $109,000, both set on May 19. An ascending trendline from December 2024 has also been capping gains for weeks. These levels are proving tough to clear. If Bitcoin can\u2019t break through soon, sellers may step in. Faibik points out that hitting these walls and seeing RSI divergence at the same time often marks the high point before a drop. This Activity Points To Caution The derivatives market adds another layer to the story. Trading volume in Bitcoin futures and options rose by 1.60%, taking total activity to around $100 billion. Open interest, meanwhile, slid down 1.30% to nearly $70 billion. This suggests some players are closing their bets rather than piling on new ones. In the past 24 hours, liquidations have wiped out $71 million in long positions. That kind of pain can trigger more sell\u2011offs if people rush to protect their profits. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Past Patterns Offer Mixed Lessons Looking back, Bitcoin\u2019s rebound in 2022 followed a different playbook. Back then, price hit a low near $16,000 and built strength even as RSI climbed from oversold levels. That setup led to a strong rally. Today, though, the RSI is nowhere near oversold territory. It\u2019s more of a warning flag than a green light. Captain Faibik reminds traders that past wins don\u2019t guarantee future results. Conditions now include higher interest rates and deeper institutional interest, which can change how Bitcoin reacts to the same signals. Featured image from Trade Brains, chart from TradingView"

Why XRP &#8216;Is Out Of Time&#8217; \u201cAfter months of tightening, the XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are only two paths from here: either the explosive breakout we\u2019ve been waiting for begins now, or we see one final sharp drop to support that ignites the breakout we\u2019ve all been preparing for.\u201d CasiTrades\u2019 roadmap turns on a single price: $2.25. XRP has probed that level repeatedly since the first week of June but has yet to close above it. \u201cPrice continues to struggle with the $2.25 level, a level I\u2019ve talked about continuously,\u201d she noted, arguing that every failed attempt increases the probability of a stop-hunt toward $2.01, $1.90, even $1.55.

Beyond geometry, timing is central to CasiTrades\u2019 argument. \u201cIt\u2019s mid-week, Wednesday\u2014this is when sentiment tends to flip,\u201d she wrote, invoking a playbook familiar to short-term traders: a fake-out in the back half of the week that reverses by Friday\u2019s close, leaving late-entrants stranded. The setup, she said, is no longer purely technical. \u201cThis is not just technicals lining up, it\u2019s the whole picture aligning.

Whether the catalyst comes from a decisive hourly close above $2.25 or from a liquidity sweep into the $1.90s, the analyst\u2019s central claim is unchanged: the consolidation\u2019s lifespan has effectively expired. As she signed off, CasiTrades offered a final exhortation\u2014short, sharp, and consistent with the urgency of his chart: \u201cDo not miss what\u2019s next.\u201d Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-channel-break/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has been crashing with the advent of the new week, spurred on by uncertainties that surround the growing conflict in the Middle East. There has also been a lot of negativity in the crypto market, with expectations that the Bitcoin price will not make new all-time highs after failing to reclaim $111,000. Even as the market continues to bleed, crypto analysts are still predicting further crashes for the digital asset, with some expecting a break of the psychological level at $100,000. Bitcoin Price Headed For Further Breakdown Crypto analyst TehThomas had previously called the Bitcoin price crash from the $108,000 territory, suggesting that the digital asset still had to fill Fair Value Gaps (FVG) at lower levels before it could continue to soar. Then recently, the crypto analyst has once again reiterated his stance as the price had begun to fall back toward $100.000. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move Coming? Thomas explained that Bitcoin was already showing signs of exhaustion. Hence, the reason for the crash was due to a loss of $108,500. At this level, with the price failing to break out higher, it showed that the initial surge had been a takeout, and the right direction was actually downward. The initial bullish move was seemingly a way for an internal liquidity grab while clearing out breakout buyers at the same time. Now, the Bitcoin price has broken below an important channel at $105,000 after a successful retest. The analyst explains that this aligns with the 50% equilibrium of the high-to-low range. Naturally, this means that the asset is still bearish and could continue to decline from here. The main levels to watch were initially at $104,600, but the Bitcoin price had first broken below this level on Tuesday. Now, if the decline continues, then the next major level investors are looking at is the $102,800, where support now lies for the cryptocurrency. Below $100,000 Is Still Possible In addition to Thomas, crypto analyst Xanrox has also predicted further price crashes for Bitcoin. He points out that the formation of a bull flag does not mean the price will continue to rise, as the flag could very well break. If this happens, then the analyst sees the Bitcoin price dropping to $100,000. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here\u2019s Why Unlike Thomas, Xanrox places his support levels at the much lower price of $88,000, which would suggest a major price crash from here. \u201cWhen we look at the current price action, it looks like a bullish flag consolidation pattern,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cIn this case we will probably see multiple liquidity sweeps below the previous swing lows to kick out early longs.\u201d Another analyst, Doctor Profit, has also turned bearish, predicting a decline below $100,000. In the X post, the crypto analyst said that the Bitcoin price is likely to fall to the $94,000-$95,000 level before seeing a bounce from there. Therefore, the analyst has told investors to prepare for more red candles. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-warns-strategy-on-track-for-historic-collapse-bigger-than-ftx/",
      "summary": "In a bold and alarming statement, on-chain analyst OxChain raised the possibility of a catastrophic collapse involving Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm co-founded by Michael Saylor. According to OxChain, this potential downfall could surpass the infamous collapse of FTX. \u2018Strategy&#8217;s Bitcoin Tactics Resemble Ponzi Scheme\u2019 In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), OxChain expressed concerns about Strategy&#8217;s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation formula, suggesting that the company&#8217;s operations resemble a Ponzi scheme. OxChain pointed out that since 2020, MicroStrategy has transformed from a traditional software company into a significant player in the Bitcoin market, currently holding around 582,000 BTC, valued at nearly $61 billion. Related Reading: Researchers Forecast Bitcoin At $4.3 Million By 2036, Citing Institutional Demand However, OxChain claims that this impressive figure is underpinned by leverage, debt, and shareholder dilution, rather than genuine conviction in the cryptocurrency. The analyst outlined Strategy&#8217;s approach as a \u201ccyclical financial loop\u201d: the firm raises capital through shares or bonds, purchases Bitcoin, announces these purchases to drive up stock prices, and then raises more funds. The analyst asserts that this cycle has worked as long as Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to rise. However, with plans for a new $1 billion share sale, OxChain believes that Strategy is increasing its risk exposure. Analyst Predicts Major Liquidation Risk OxChain warns that Strategy&#8217;s average cost per Bitcoin is approximately $70,000, creating a precarious situation. The analyst adds that if Bitcoin\u2019s price falls significantly below this level, the company&#8217;s treasury, currently valued at around $25 billion, could quickly start to suffer losses. According to the analyst, despite Saylor&#8217;s public commitment to never sell Bitcoin, the realities of accounting and risk management may force the company to act if market conditions deteriorate. In the first quarter of 2025, Strategy disclosed $5.9 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses, revealing the volatility of its assets. Under the new accounting standard ASC 350-60, the company is required to report fair value, eliminating the ability to hide behind book value. This transparency has already led to legal repercussions, with shareholders filing a class action lawsuit alleging that Strategy concealed the risks associated with Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility while aggressively raising capital. OxChain further claimed during his social media thread that Strategy&#8217;s role as a Bitcoin access point is diminishing, especially as institutional capital flows into \u201cmore transparent and regulated options,\u201d such as BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed around $70 billion in assets under management. The analyst stressed that unlike Strategy, which reportedly faces dilution risks and operates with limited safeguards, IBIT offers a \u201cmore stable investment\u201d for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Altcoin Alert: Expert Reveals Hottest Opportunities For The Summer Season If Strategy were to falter, the implications would be far-reaching, OxChain added. The firm holds approximately 2.77% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply, and a significant liquidation could send shockwaves through the market. The analyst warns that a decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price by just 22% from its average buy price could trigger corporate liquidations, potentially leading to one of the largest liquidation events in history. Ultimately, OxChain cautions that Strategy is neither a hero nor a villain in the crypto ecosystem; instead, he said that it represents a \u201crisk vector heavily reliant on leverage and market sentiment.\u201d Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"
