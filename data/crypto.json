      "summary": "Crypto analyst Jaydee has called out market participants who predict that the XRP price could rally to as high as $1,000. The analyst suggested that the altcoin can\u2019t reach such heights and revealed what price levels he will be taking profits at. Analyst Indicates XRP Price Cannot Reach $1,000 In an X post, Jaydee stated that while the \u201cmoonboys and influencers: are waiting for the XRP price to reach $1,000, he plans to take more profits at his next levels. He declared that he plans to use the same strategy he employed when he called the 12x at $3.37. The analyst admitted that the altcoin is going much higher soon but suggested that those waiting for $1,000 will still get \u201crekt.\u201d Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Reach $20-$30 \u2014 Elliott Wave Theory Holds The Key Jaydee further remarked that they \u201cdumb money to HODL till $1,000 for us smart money to win big.\u201d His statement comes just a day after crypto pundit BarriC predicted that the XRP price will rally to $1,000 sooner than many expect. He further suggested that the rally will be similar to how XRP recorded an explosive surge in 2017, when it rallied from $0.0006 to $3.80. However, Jaydee doesn\u2019t expect this to happen. Instead, his accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could just rally to a conservative target of around $7 between August and September. This would still mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin. The crypto analyst also recently predicted a 50% \u201cmoonshot\u201d for the XRP price, which could send it to as high as $3.35 in the short term. A rally to $3.35 will bring the altcoin close to its current ATH of $3.80. It would also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. XRP Is Bullish On All Timeframes In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender declared that the XRP price is bullish on all timeframes for the first time since January 2025, when it reached its yearly high of $3.3. In another X post, the analyst stated that XRP is way ahead, having recorded a breakout above $2.33. With this breakout, he remarked that the altcoin\u2019s journey to its all-time high has begun. Related Reading: XRP Price Closes Highest Quarterly Candle In History Dark Defender\u2019s accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could surpass its current ATH of $3.80 and rally to $4.2.

Crypto analyst CasiTrades also highlighted how bullish the break above $2.30 was for XRP. She claimed that the altcoin could reach as high as $3.04 on this leg up. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.42, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s latest hourly close may be offering more than meets the eye. With the 25- and 50-hour SMAs holding firm and the MACD showing renewed expansion, some analysts believe a breakout could be quietly brewing, and smart traders are starting to take notice. BTC\u2019s Momentum Builds With Healthy Technical Backing In his latest 1-hour market update, Shaco AI noted that Bitcoin continues to humor the bulls, printing a strong close at $111,225.5. The price action has maintained a clear bullish bias, staying well above both the 25-hour simple moving average (SMA) at $110,147 and the 50-hour SMA at $109,420. This positioning suggests that BTC is building a solid base for continuation, with short-term trend followers likely remaining confident in the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading Furthermore, the MACD has widened impressively, with a gain of $589.72, reflecting persistent buying pressure and bullish sentiment. As the MACD histogram expands and signal lines diverge, it reinforces the idea that the bulls may be far from done, and dips could be viewed as buying opportunities. Shaco AI also pointed to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now sits at 63.73. This level shows that the market is in a healthy bullish zone, strong enough to maintain upward momentum, but not yet in overbought territory that typically invites profit-taking or cooling off. Adding confidence to the trend, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has hit 38.93, which Shaco AI emphasized as a key confirmation that the current trend has strength and durability. With all key indicators pointing to continued bullish structure, supported by rising momentum, trend alignment, and strong directional force, Bitcoin\u2019s short-term technical picture remains decisively positive. The bulls are in control, and the chart suggests they may not be done pushing just yet. Breakout Or Breakdown? Bitcoin Poised At A Technical Crossroads Shaco AI, in his final remarks, highlighted that Bitcoin is approaching critical territory, marking resistance at $111,999.79 and support at $108,096.55 as the key zones to watch. He urged traders to &#8220;watch these like a hawk!&#8221; as price action around these levels could be decisive in determining BTC\u2019s next major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Upward Move \u2014 Can It Break New Highs? He also pointed out that trading volume has been unusually quiet, joking that it &#8220;seems to have missed some coffee breaks,&#8221; with just 395 units recorded compared to the average of 869. This lighter volume signals reduced conviction, which could lead to sudden volatility or fakeouts near those key zones. \u201cKeep those eyes peeled for potential breakouts or retracements as BTC flirts with key levels, but do remember there&#8217;s caution in the air with this lighter trading volume,\u201d the expert added.

      "summary": "Solana is exhibiting strong bullish signs supported by moving averages, volume, and momentum indicators, which hint at a short-term pause or consolidation in the rally. What Bulls Need To Watch To Sustain The Rally In an X post, Gemxbt stated that the Solana 1-hour chart has displayed a bullish market structure, with the price trading above the 5, 10, and 20-day moving averages. The indication of short-term moving averages signals strong upward momentum, which shows that buyers are in control. The recent price action has been supported by notable volume spikes, confirming the strength behind the upward moves and adding credibility to the rally. Related Reading: Solana Whale Moves $152 Million In One Splash\u2014What\u2019s Going On? The key resistance is around $154, where SOL has previously faced selling pressure. This zone will determine whether bullish momentum can push the price higher. On the downside, support is sitting near $150, which is acting as a cushion to absorb any immediate selling pressure and prevent a deeper pullback. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, which may signal that the asset is due for a period of consolidation or sideways movement before continuing its climb. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recently shown a bullish crossover, reinforcing the uptrend and suggesting the upward momentum could continue if buying interest persists. Crypto investor and trader Theodor Coin also revealed that the Solana 1-hour chart is showing a clear recovery after the dip seen in early July. The open interest is trending upward and has now surpassed $3.62 billion. An increase here typically indicates growing trader market engagement, which is a precursor to heightened volatility and significant price moves. From here, a breakout above the $154 resistance could unleash a powerful rally fueled by the increasing market interest and positive momentum. Uptrend Line Remains Intact \u2014 A Positive Sign A crypto analyst known as Day on X also updated that Solana is holding above the long-term support area around $120 on the weekly chart, a level that has been a launchpad for rallies. Related Reading: Solana Ready For $160 Reclaim? Analysts Say Breakout Is A Matter Of Time The long-term uptrend line remains intact, and with each higher low, the case for a massive cup-and-handle pattern becomes stronger. However, this pattern won&#8217;t confirm until SOL breaks above the critical $250 resistance zone, a level that capped price action during the previous rally. If SOL manages to break out above the $250 zone, it could unlock a measured move price target of $500, which marks a milestone in Solana&#8217;s recovery and expansion. The analyst also noted that SOL is not there yet, and that the first step for bulls is reclaiming $185 resistance level, which has consistently rejected upside attempts. featured image from iStock images, chart from tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trump-familys-wlfi-token-experts-bullish-on-5-price-projection-post-launch/",
      "summary": "World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform backed by President Donald Trump and his family, is poised to launch its WLFI token, which could hold significant profits for early investors. WLFI Token Launch Approaches The company announced on July 4 that it has initiated steps to have its flagship token listed on cryptocurrency exchanges, marking a crucial milestone after months of anticipation. The WLFI token, which was introduced last year as a non-transferable governance token, is designed to facilitate community voting on the project&#8217;s future direction. Related Reading: Tether Secret Swiss Vault: The $8 Billion Gold Reserve Behind The Stablecoin Secondary market trading has already commenced on platforms like Whales.market and MEXC, where WLFI has recently traded between $0.13 to $0.18, a notable increase from its initial sale prices of $1.5 and $0.5. According to the project\u2019s white paper, entities affiliated with the Trump family may collectively hold about one-third of WLFI\u2019s total supply of 100 billion tokens. At current prices, these holdings could represent billions of dollars on paper. Bruno Ver, market expert and investor in the WLFI token, expressed optimism about its potential value, predicting it could reach between $2 and $5 in the near future. If the token were to climb to $2, the stake held by the founding entities could theoretically be worth around $60 billion, making it one of the most lucrative Trump-related crypto ventures to date. Recent estimates suggest that crypto businesses have already added approximately $620 million to Donald Trump\u2019s personal net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Experts Warn Of Risks Despite the enthusiasm surrounding WLFI, the White House has emphasized that President Trump is distanced from his business interests, having placed his assets in a family-controlled trust. The current proposal for token release, dated July 4, aims to unlock a portion of tokens held by &#8220;early supporters,&#8221; although the term lacks a specific definition within the documentation. Remaining tokens, including those held by founders and team members, would be subject to future votes and longer lock-up periods to signal a commitment to the project. The proposal is expected to undergo discussion and voting on the Snapshot platform, with a potential timeline extending into August. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 2,000% Cardano Rally: \u2018Fractal Is Too Clean To Ignore\u2019 However, experts caution that the path to a successful launch might come with risks for early holders. Lex Sokolin, managing partner at Generative Ventures, pointed out that tokens with substantial founder and investor allocations often experience significant price declines over time. World Liberty Financial\u2019s token launch and the Trump family\u2019s increased interest in digital assets comes on the heels of notable regulatory changes in the US as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a more lenient stance toward crypto. This may signal a sense of confidence from WLFI regarding regulatory scrutiny. Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, noted that this shift suggests WLFI no longer perceives a threat from the SEC. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/ripple-2/ripple-take-over-swifts-customers/",
      "summary": "Ripple\u2019s ambitions in the global payments space have grown louder and more direct, as its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, openly stated at APEX 2025 that the company is aiming to take over SWIFT\u2019s customer base. The commentary follows Ripple\u2019s long-term strategy to shift global banking infrastructure away from legacy systems to the blockchain-based XRP Ledger. Meanwhile, central banks are increasingly taking note, with recent reports revealing that the capacity of Ripple&#8217;s network is currently being studied alongside SWIFT\u2019s systems in experiments. Garlinghouse Sets Sights On SWIFT\u2019s Market Share Speaking at the APEX summit, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared that Ripple\u2019s goal is not only to compete with SWIFT but to replace its role in moving money on the global scale. According to Garlinghouse, although SWIFT is very dominant in messaging, the most important thing is the liquidity that banks can provide. Related Reading: Ripple To Replace SWIFT? XRP Analyst Breaks Down Recent Developments \u201cI think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,\u201d he said. Ripple is targeting this deeper infrastructure among banks, which is the actual movement of value. Interestingly, Garlinghouse asserted that Ripple plans to capture up to 14% of SWIFT\u2019s current cross-border volume within five years. That\u2019s a bold number, especially considering the scale at which SWIFT currently operates. Recent estimates show that SWIFT currently facilitates more than 45 million financial messages and handles around $5 trillion in money transfers daily. Even a 14% share of that market would represent hundreds of billions of dollars in value flowing through Ripple\u2019s ecosystem, which would create a significant demand for XRP in the process. Central Banks Are Tapping In Garlinghouse\u2019s comments come at a time when institutional momentum appears to be shifting in Ripple\u2019s favor. Interestingly, Ripple\u2019s global push is not limited to private sector partnerships. A crypto enthusiast on the social media platform X known as Finance Bull recently drew attention to growing central bank interest in blockchain-based payment infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, Ripple\u2019s technology is the key focus to this growing interest. Related Reading: Ripple Plans To Take 14% Of SWIFT Volume, USDC Lands On XRPL \u2013 What Does This Mean For XRP Price? Ripple\u2019s xCurrent solution, which is built on the Interledger Protocol (ILP), was recently studied alongside SWIFT\u2019s gpi system as part of Project Stella. Project Stella is a collaborative research initiative by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Basically, what this means is that central banks are starting to look into Ripple&#8217;s technology, which says a lot about the ecosystem&#8217;s outlook in the coming years. The fact that two of the world&#8217;s most influential central banks reviewed Ripple\u2019s infrastructure alongside SWIFT is a signal that XRP\u2019s utility is now being evaluated at the core of global monetary policy discussions. These developments closely align with what many fervent XRP supporters have long believed. There have been recurring predictions among the community\u2019s most confident voices that XRP\u2019s price is destined to move far beyond its current all-time high of $3.40. Some technical analyses have predicted double-digit prices for XRP. Other predictions for the XRP price are as high as $1,000. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
