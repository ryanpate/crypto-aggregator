      "summary": "Bitcoin prices have returned above $105,000 in the past 24 hours following a sharp price decline on Thursday triggered by macroeconomic pressures. Notably, US President Donald Trump and former political ally Elon Musk had engaged in a public spat which spiked the volatility in a crypto market already undergoing a corrective phase. Amidst some level of renewed stability in the last two days, popular analytics firm Glassnode has now shared an important on-chain analysis highlighting the presently key price levels in the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? Bitcoin Ready For Breakout As Traders Eye $114K And $83K Levels In an X post on June 7, Glassnode provides an insight on potential Bitcoin price action using the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis model, derived from the Work of Cost (WOC) price framework. As the name implies, the STH cost basis represents the average purchased price of all coins belonging to short-term holders i.e. investors who acquired their Bitcoin within the last 155 days. The STH cost basis is an important market metric as it reflects the risk appetite of newer market participants who are typically the most reactive to price change. It is also a strong indicator of market sentiment with an ability to act as resistance or support depending on the price direction. According to the data by Glassnode, the current Bitcoin STH cost basis is estimated at $97,100. Using standard deviation bands in this WOC model, Glassnode has further identified the $114,800 price level as the +1STD level of this cost basis and a potentially heated market zone. Considering Bitcoin&#8217;s price, this $114,800 price zone represents the next major resistance, a break above which is expected to trigger a massive buying pressure and push the premier cryptocurrency further into uncharted price territory. Glassnode\u2019s WOC model also identifies the -1STD level at $83,200 to represent a critical support zone in the present bullish structure. A decisive price fall below this level would signal market weakness and is likely to cause a cascade of liquidations and further price corrections. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn\u2019t Gone Off Yet \u2014 What To Know Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105,745 reflecting a 1.07% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset\u2019s daily trading volume is down by 34.27% and valued at $38.66 billion. Provided Bitcoin continues to consolidate above the STH cost basis at $97,100, there is a valid chance for a market bullish push towards resistance at $114,800. However, a loss of the critical support at $97,100 would points to a retest at $83,200 which holds strong potential bearish consequences. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview"

      "summary": "Popular market analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Sui (SUI) for an impending price breakout. Notably, the prominent altcoin has recorded a steady price decline in the past month with an estimated loss of 17.18% within this period. However, Pillows notes the formation of a bullish pattern which indicates substantial market relief ahead. Related Reading: SUI Rally At Risk? Analysts Warn Of 30% Dip If This Level Doesn\u2019t Hold SUI Gathers Momentum Ahead Of Showdown With Resistance In an X post on June 7, Pillows shares a positive insight into the SUI market despite a sustained downtrend throughout May and early June. The analyst notes that SUI appears to hit local bottom within the $2.8-$3.0 following a slight rebound in the past 48 hours. Interestingly, this recent price action could signal market reversal especially considering the formation of a bullish descending wedge pattern on the SUI daily chart. For context, the descending wedge is a classic bullish reversal pattern marked by two converging trend lines sloping downward as seen in the chart below. The price action within the wedge which typically consists of lower highs and lower lows but the decreasing slope of the lows signal a weakening bearish pressure. Considering the rebound from the $2.8 which represents the lower boundary of the descending wedge and the narrowing of both trend lines, Pillows postulates SUI is preparing for a major upside price breakout. However, the altcoin must overcome a crucial resistance at $3.5 price level which represents the upper boundary of the descending wedge pattern. Pillows explains that a successful daily price close above $3.5 is likely to trigger a robust buying pressure that could force a SUI market rally for the next 2-3 weeks leading to a new all-time high. Based on the analysis presented, initial price targets are set at $4.00 indicating an instant return to the peak price region in May. However, with Pillows\u2019 analysis hinting at a new all-time high, investors should expect any potential price breakout to hit a minimum price target of $5.21 representing a 60.8% gain on present market prices. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn\u2019t Gone Off Yet \u2014 What To Know SUI Price Overview At the time of writing, SUI trades at $3.23 representing a 2.33% gain in the past day. However, weekly and monthly losses of 1.01% and 17.10%, respectively suggests the altcoin still has ground to make up. Nevertheless, SUI remains one of the best performing tokens of the present market cycle with potential star of the altseason considering its 211.11% in the last year.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ethereum-head-shoulders-pattern-breakdown-can-bulls-reclaim-control/",
      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s recent price action on the 4-hour chart has led to the formation of a classic Head and Shoulders pattern that opens up the possibility of a deeper correction. After a relatively stable period around the $2,500 zone, Ethereum broke below a neckline support level as last week drew to a close. This raises the question of whether a bearish continuation is already in motion for the Ethereum price or if bulls still have a shot at regaining momentum in the new week. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Head &#38; Shoulders Pattern Confirmed After Breakdown Below $2,480 The Head and Shoulders pattern, one of the most recognizable reversal formations in technical analysis, is now clearly visible on Ethereum\u2019s 4-hour candlestick chart. This chart and the technical outlook were first shared on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MelikaTrader94. The structure includes a left shoulder, a prominent head peaking above $2,700, and a right shoulder that topped near $2,650. The neckline, drawn around $2,480, was breached during Ethereum&#8217;s recent pullback to $2,380. This, in turn, shifted the short-term outlook toward the bearish side. After the break, Ethereum attempted to reclaim lost ground and is currently retesting the neckline area. This retest around $2,500 is significant, as a failure to push back above this level significantly would likely validate the bearish setup and cause the Ethereum price to reverse downwards toward the next support zone. According to the outlook from analyst MelikaTrader94, the price target from this Head and Shoulders breakdown before any notable rebound upward can occur lies between $2,200 and $2,250. Chart Image From TradingView: MelikaTrader94 Bulls Must Reclaim $2,650 To Invalidate Bearish Setup A confluence of factors supports the $2,200 region as a likely landing zone. Not only is this level consistent with the measured move of the Head and Shoulders pattern, but it also aligns with an order block on May 9 during Ethereum&#8217;s rally above $2,000 at the time. This adds further technical relevance to the $2,200 to $2,250 range acting as a support zone. However, the situation is not fully bearish yet. The path forward is clear but narrow for Ethereum bulls. The first step to invalidate the bearish setup is to reclaim the neckline around $2,500 decisively. Beyond that, breaking back above the right shoulder level around $2,650 would invalidate the Head and Shoulders pattern, and another pattern will most likely come into play. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger A successful bullish reclaim would not only nullify the bearish pattern but could also revive sentiment for another retest of the $2,700 to $2,800 zone, which corresponds to the peak of the head in the recently formed pattern. Until such a recovery occurs, the Ethereum price can quickly reverse downwards at any time. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,510.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-the-uk-lifts-ban-on-crypto-etns-for-retail-investors/",
      "summary": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the UK is all set to lift its ban on cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors. The FCA had banned ETNs in January 2021, citing their volatility and complexity for retail investors. However, because we\u2019re seeing increasing warmth towards cryptocurrency across the globe, the UK doesn\u2019t want to be left behind. Keep reading to find out more about the UK\u2019s decision regarding ETNs, how the US also has major pro-crypto legislation in the works, and what the best crypto to buy now is in light of these developments. UK &#38; UK Embrace Crypto For those unaware, an ETN is a debt security instrument offered by recognized entities. Its value is tied to an underlying asset, which, in the case of crypto, is a specific coin. As the price of the underlying asset goes up, the price of the ETN will also increase, and vice versa. It\u2019s worth noting that crypto ownership in the UK has increased from 18% in 2024 to 24% in 2025. This is more than that of the US. Naturally, a growth like this calls for a comprehensive regulatory design to regulate the ownership and use of digital assets in the country. Meanwhile, in the US, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is expected to go for a floor vote soon enough. The GENIUS Act aims to regulate various aspects of stablecoins, such as permitted issuers, transparency, consumer protection, federal and state-level oversight authority, and legal classification. All in all, a friendlier regulatory environment will lead to a more thriving crypto market. Bitcoin recently made an all-time high of $112K, and with positive and proactive legislative support, it might soon hit $150K, too. To hop on the crypto train and make the most of its momentum, consider investing in the following altcoins. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Best Crypto to Buy Now, the Fastest and Most Affordable Trading Bot Increased crypto adoption will directly impact the growth of meme coins, which is already among the most profitable niches of the crypto space. As a result, Snorter Token could see massive growth in the coming weeks. It&#8217;s a Telegram-native trading bot designed to snipe (buy) the best meme coins as soon as they&#8217;re launched using a contact address or pool ID. This way, it will help you outsmart the bots and whales circling like sharks in the crypto market. Snorter Bot is mighty secure, too. It&#8217;s got honeypot and rugpull detection, mint trap detection, real-time blacklist scans, and freeze alerts. Other useful features include copy-trading tools, portfolio tracking, and the lowest trading fees (just 0.85%) of all competitors if you hold $SNORT. You can become an early investor in this awesome meme coin with real utility by buying into its presale. The Snorter Token presale is fairly new but has still managed to raise over $575K. Each token is currently priced at just $0.0947. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will help you directly benefit from Bitcoin&#8217;s upcoming bull run, but at a fraction of the cost. It&#8217;ll do so in two ways: First, you&#8217;ll profit from a substantial increase in $BTCBULL&#8217;s price. According to our predictions, BTC Bull Token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 \u2013 a 3.7x jump from its current price of $0.00255. Second, you&#8217;ll benefit from BTC Bull Token&#8217;s free Bitcoin airdrops. A striking feature, the aforementioned $BTC airdrops will take place when Bitcoin reaches $150K and $200K for the very first time. However, only those who hold their $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events on social media will be eligible for free $BTC. Even better for $BTCBULL owners, the project will regularly shave off a part of the token supply. This will increase the crypto&#8217;s demand, which would then, in all likelihood, crank up its price. Buy BTC Bull Token now for just $0.00255 each. The project has emerged as one of the best crypto presales, with nearly $7M in early investor funding. 3. KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) \u2013 Viral New Meme Coin with Massive Potential KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) is a new meme coin that launched towards the end of May but has risen to become a force to reckon with in the entire crypto space. $KOKOK is up over 310% since its inception, including a chunky 28% gain over just the past seven days. This fascinating &#8216;disgusting&#8217; meme coin is proof that degens have enough love to share with other animals, too, besides cute dogs, cats, and frogs. &#8216;The King of the Drain Pipes&#8217; might be a fitting description for $KOKOK, but the fact remains that it could soon surge past its all-time high of around $0.20 and become one of the greatest meme coins of this year. It&#8217;s currently trading at $0.1724, with a market capitalization of $35M and a trading volume of $1.13M (up 110% over the past 24 hours). Increasing Crypto Adoption Notwithstanding, DYOR Is Necessary Despite the market&#8217;s increasing bullish outlook on the back of pro-crypto regulatory reforms, there&#8217;s no guaranteeing any returns on specific coins. The crypto market is highly unpredictable and volatile, so kindly do your own research before investing. Our articles are purely informational, not financial advice."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-consolidates-below-2800-bulls-need-this-level-to-trigger-next-leg-up/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is showing resilience amid the recent wave of market volatility and uncertainty. While the broader crypto market has pulled back over the past few weeks, ETH continues to hold firm above the $2,500 level \u2014 a key psychological and technical support zone. This strength has caught the attention of traders and analysts who see Ethereum\u2019s current price action as a potential launchpad for a move into higher territory. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart \u2013 Rally Ahead? Despite the retracement across major altcoins, Ethereum remains structurally intact, with bulls defending the lower boundary of its current range. The lack of panic-selling at these levels suggests growing confidence in ETH\u2019s long-term trajectory, even as macroeconomic pressures \u2014 including tighter liquidity and geopolitical uncertainty \u2014 continue to weigh on sentiment. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared a technical update highlighting that ETH is still trading within a well-defined range. According to his view, Ethereum\u2019s ability to consolidate without losing critical support is a sign of underlying strength. A breakout above the range high could trigger renewed momentum toward the $2,800\u2013$3,000 region, while a breakdown below $2,500 would invalidate the current setup. Ethereum Approaches Pivotal Zone Amid Uncertainty The crypto market has been navigating a volatile environment, and Ethereum is no exception. However, despite the turbulence, ETH has managed to maintain its footing above $2,500 \u2014 a key support level that continues to act as a buffer against deeper downside. With Bitcoin holding strong and altcoins preparing for potential breakout moves, the coming weeks could be decisive for Ethereum\u2019s next major trend. ETH currently trades 48% below its all-time high, but price action suggests that bulls are building momentum. Ethereum has absorbed recent volatility well, even as broader market sentiment remains shaken by rising geopolitical tensions, most notably, the growing conflict between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. While these headlines have added uncertainty, Ethereum\u2019s ability to stay range-bound reflects growing confidence among investors. Pillows notes that Ethereum is still trading within a well-defined range, and the structure remains intact. According to his analysis, reclaiming the $2,800 level would be a key breakout trigger, potentially opening the door for a fast rally to $4,000. Until then, ETH remains in consolidation mode \u2014 but with Bitcoin showing leadership and the market entering a pivotal phase, Ethereum could be on the verge of catching up. If bulls can maintain control and push through resistance, ETH could finally break out of its range and reenter a bullish price discovery phase. But if resistance holds, traders may see another leg of consolidation. Either way, Ethereum is entering a key window where market direction will likely be defined, and how ETH behaves around the $2,800 mark could determine the altcoin outlook for the rest of the summer. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop \u2013 Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Weekly Chart Shows Momentum Building Near Resistance Ethereum is holding steady near $2,500 as seen on the weekly chart, showing promising signs of strength despite recent market-wide volatility. After bouncing sharply from sub-$1,800 levels in May, ETH is now consolidating just below the $2,707 resistance \u2014 the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This level coincides with the upper boundary of the current range and remains the key line bulls need to reclaim to unlock further upside. ETH is currently trading above its 34-week EMA ($2,501) and the 200-week SMA ($2,450), both of which are acting as dynamic support. Holding these levels reinforces the idea that buyers are stepping in on dips, providing a strong base for potential continuation. However, the price is still capped by the 100-week SMA at $2,610, making the $2,700\u2013$2,800 region a critical resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support After Pullback \u2013 Bulls Eye $3,000 Level A weekly close above this cluster of moving averages could trigger a breakout and pave the way toward $3,000 and beyond.
