      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to show signs of consolidation following its all-time high of over $111,000 recorded in May. At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $104,851, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours and roughly 6.3% below its recent peak. This period of relative price stability comes amid cautious sentiment across the broader crypto market, as analysts examine whether the current bull cycle is beginning to shift gears or simply experiencing a temporary pause. CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan has released a comparative analysis of current and past market cycles, noting several distinct behaviors in Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action. Drawing parallels to the bull runs of 2017 and 2021, Dan suggests that while similarities exist, the current cycle has developed unique characteristics. These changes could signal a different structure in how the market plays out, particularly in terms of timing and investor participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Comparing Bitcoin Cycles: 2024\u20132025 Diverges from Historical Patterns According to Dan, previous cycles saw more predictable corrections and rallies. In 2017, Bitcoin experienced relatively short corrections before entering a prolonged rally that concluded in late December of that year. The 2021 cycle, affected early on by the COVID-19 pandemic, featured a longer initial correction before a strong upward surge. In both cases, once Bitcoin gained momentum, corrections became less frequent and shorter in duration. The current cycle, spanning 2024\u20132025, has so far been marked by alternating strong rallies and sudden declines, often occurring over short timeframes. These patterns have dampened broader market sentiment, particularly during periods when altcoins significantly underperformed Bitcoin. Dan posits that these repeated pullbacks may not be purely organic. Instead, they could indicate intentional suppression by large players aiming to extend the cycle\u2019s duration and prevent overheating. If this interpretation holds, the bull cycle could end not with a gradual fade, but a sharp spike driven by euphoric buying behavior. Retail Activity Declines as Institutions Drive Market Structure A separate analysis by CryptoQuant\u2019s Burak Kesmeci focuses on the behavior of retail investors since Bitcoin hit its $111,000 high in late May. Data shows that retail transfer volumes, transactions valued between $0 and $10,000, have decreased from $423 million to $408 million. Additionally, the 30-day change in retail demand has slipped into negative territory, shifting from +5 points to -0.11 points. This reduction in retail activity suggests that smaller investors remain sensitive to short-term volatility, stepping back in response to recent price corrections. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History\u2019s Turning Kesmeci argues that for the bull cycle to sustain momentum, consistent participation from retail segments is crucial. At present, institutional interest appears to be the primary source of demand. The divergence between these two investor classes may shape how the next leg of Bitcoin\u2019s market cycle develops.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-hash-ribbons-indicating-prime-buying-opportunity-analyst-says/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) remains range-bound in the mid-$100,000s, showing no clear directional bias. However, the Hash Ribbons indicator is now flashing a fresh buy signal, suggesting that the top cryptocurrency may be gearing up for its next upward move. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Ribbons are signalling a potential prime buying opportunity for the leading digital asset. This signal coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate reaching new all-time highs (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Giant Abandons Full-Hold Strategy, Unloads $40M In Crypto For the uninitiated, Bitcoin Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that analyzes miner stress by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average after a period of decline, it signals that miner capitulation is ending &#8211; often marking a strong long-term buying opportunity. Such signals can emerge when mining becomes unprofitable for certain miners, forcing them to sell their BTC holdings to stay afloat. These sell-offs may temporarily pressure the price, but historically they have created attractive long-term buying opportunities. In their analysis, Darkfost notes that while the current signal is bullish from a long-term perspective, it could lead to a short-term pullback in BTC price. However, he emphasizes that any dip should be viewed as a chance to accumulate. Darkfost also pointed out that the Hash Ribbons indicator has historically been reliable, with the exception of 2021 during the China mining ban. They shared the following chart illustrating how the indicator is currently showing a strong buy signal. Is BTC Headed For A Crash? While the Hash Ribbons suggest a favorable long-term setup, some analysts warn that the short-term correction could be deeper than expected. For instance, crypto analyst Xanrox used the Fibonacci levels to forecast that BTC may tumble as low as $98,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning Signs? Long-Term Holders Exit While Retail Buyers Rush In Similarly, analyst Jelle noted that Bitcoin may face \u201cone last speed bump\u201d before launching a major rally to $140,000. Meanwhile, more pessimistic voices continue to warn of a dramatic crash, with some speculating that BTC could fall below $10,000 &#8211; a view seen as increasingly unlikely by most market participants. Despite the varying predictions, fresh on-chain data points to a healthy BTC market in the near to medium term. For instance, CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently highlighted that the derivatives market has undergone a reset, with funding rates stabilizing around neutral levels. Similarly, Fundstrat\u2019s Head of Research, Tom Lee foresees BTC surging to as high as $250,000 by the end of the year. At press time, BTC trades at $105,367, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Webus International Plans Huge Reserve According to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Webus International aims to raise $300 million through non-equity funding. The company will tap its existing cash, credit lines backed by institutions, and support from shareholders.

The plan comes with a partner: Samara Alpha Management. Webus says the altcoin will help the firm with global payment services. They think it can move value quickly across borders, and this treasury could back that. VivoPower\u2019s XRP Ambition Based on reports, VivoPower is setting aside about $121 million to build its own XRP stash. The public announcement highlights a recent private placement led by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. Most of the $121 million raised will go straight into the coin. VivoPower even wants to rebrand itself as the world\u2019s first company focused on XRP. That\u2019s a bold goal for a firm listed on Nasdaq. If everything goes to plan, XRP would play a big role in how VivoPower manages money and transactions. Wellgistics Health Joins Trend Wellgistics Health, a healthcare company you might not expect to dive into cryptocurrency, has its own $50 million set aside for XRP. The cash came in last month and is meant for PX (purchase and hold XRP) and to use XRP for real-time payments. Wellgistics says it wants to cut out delays and fees that come with old\u2010school payment methods. By sending and receiving XRP, the company believes it can move money faster when it pays vendors or gets paid by customers. It\u2019s a sign that even outside tech or finance, firms see value in holding crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Growing Interest Among Firms This trio isn\u2019t alone. In December, Worksport said it would buy both XRP and Bitcoin, using 10% of its operating cash to build reserves.

On top of that, the US government mentioned XRP as one of the assets it might add to a digital asset stockpile. That\u2019s a signal to private companies that holding XRP is worth a look.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-2-billion-open-interest/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s open interest is in focus, with this crucial metric highlighting the amount of interest that the top meme coin is getting at the moment. This comes as DOGE continues to struggle below the psychological $0.2 level, providing a bearish outlook for the meme coin. Dogecoin Open Interest Averages $2 Billion In June Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin open interest (OI) has been hovering around $2 billion since the start of this month. This represents a drop from the open interest recorded in May. DOGE\u2019s OI had climbed to as high as $3.07 billion on May 11 as the meme coin\u2019s price surged to $0.25. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself This drop in Dogecoin open interest can be attributed to the drop in DOGE\u2019s price since then. The meme coin began the month below the psychological $0.2 level, which has sparked bearish sentiments. Open interest refers to the amount of interest in the derivatives market for a particular asset. As such, a drop in this metric is usually bearish. However, it is worth mentioning that the Dogecoin open interest is still above the monthly average recorded in March and April, during the period when the Trump tariffs caused crypto assets to tumble. Back then, DOGE dropped to as low as $0.14 and was at risk of losing its bull market structure. Crypto analyst BitMonty expects DOGE to bounce back amid this drop in the Dogecoin open interest. In an X post, he said the meme coin is testing the 0.618 Fib retracement and the lower boundary of a falling wedge. He added that this is a high confluence bounce zone, and reversal signs could spark a breakout move soon. BitMonty predicts that DOGE could rally to as high as $0.26420 on this bounce. DOGE Setting Up For A Bullish Reversal In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade indicated that the Dogecoin price may be setting up for a bullish reversal. He revealed that DOGE is returning to the previous swing low, while the RSI shows a higher low. The analyst noted that this could lead to a bullish divergence, indicating weakened selling momentum and early signs of a potential reversal to the upside. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Expected To Reach $3 By EOY As 2021 Cycle Trend Returns In another X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin is expected to experience a significant surge before entering a prolonged falling wedge pullback. Interestingly, his accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could rally to as high as $30. However, this price surge isn\u2019t expected to happen in just this market cycle alone, with the chart highlighting 2029 as the target year to reach this price level. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.18, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "title": "PEPE Powers Up: Successful Retest Of Breakout Zone Sets Stage For Next Leg Higher",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/pepe/pepe-set-for-next-leg-higher/",
      "summary": "&#8220;PEPE is showing strength after a clean breakout above the key resistance zone,\u201d UniChartz shared in a recent post on X, highlighting a decisive shift in the meme coin\u2019s short-term momentum. The breakout reflects renewed buying pressure as the price pushed beyond a major barrier that had previously capped upside moves. PEPE Finds Its Footing at Strong Confluence Zone The analyst further noted that PEPE is now &#8220;in the process of retesting that breakout level,&#8221; calling it &#8220;a classic bullish confirmation if the zone holds.&#8221; This retest phase is a critical moment; if bulls successfully defend the newly formed support zone, it could open the door for another leg higher. Overall, the price action suggests that bullish momentum is building, with the current consolidation acting as a potential launchpad for the next move upward. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump\u2019s Feed\u2014Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? According to UniChartz, PEPE\u2019s price action continues to respect a well-established rising trendline, which has acted as reliable dynamic support over the past few months. This trendline has been tested on multiple occasions, each time resulting in a bullish reaction, a strong indication that buyers are stepping in during these retests. Furthermore, this diagonal support aligns closely with a key horizontal demand zone, forming a critical confluence that strengthens the overall bullish structure. As long as PEPE stays above these intersecting support levels, the market structure remains tilted in favor of the bulls. The price consolidating in this region suggests a potential accumulation phase, where market participants are preparing for the next move. Should PEPE bounce strongly from this confluence area, it could mark the beginning of a renewed upward leg, potentially attracting fresh buying interest and reinforcing positive sentiment. Such a move would confirm the trendline\u2019s significance and validate PEPE\u2019s ability to maintain its medium-term uptrend amid broader market uncertainty. Volume Supporting The Bullish Shift According to Whales_Crypto_Trading, PEPE has broken out of its descending channel with impressive volume, signaling a potential shift in momentum for the meme coin. PEPE\u2019s breakout was backed by a notable surge in trading activity, indicating strong interest from market participants and potentially the involvement of larger players. Related Reading: PEPE Rising Trendline Holds Firm: A Reliable Launchpad For Price Rally The analyst emphasized that if the current retest of the breakout zone holds, it may act as a launchpad for further upside in the upcoming weeks. This kind of technical retest, when supported by volume, often serves as a validation of trend reversal and reinforces bullish sentiment. Featured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com"
