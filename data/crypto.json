      "summary": "The market\u2019s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), dipped below the $100,000 mark for the first time in over a month on Sunday, following US airstrikes on Iran as conflicts in the middle east continue to escalate. This decline, which saw the Bitcoin price drop approximately 4% to around $99,300, coincided with a broader market sell-off, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing an even sharper decline of nearly 10%. Overall, the total cryptocurrency market took a significant hit, falling about 7% in just 24 hours. Geopolitical Unrest And Tariff Troubles The timing of this downturn was particularly notable, occurring just hours after the US targeted three key nuclear sites in Iran. Tensions had escalated following a United Nations report that indicated Iran was not adhering to international prohibitions against developing a military nuclear program. In response to these revelations, Israel conducted strikes against Iran, leading to further retaliation from the Islamic Republic. On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared on social media: This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU! Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure \u2013 Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This recent plummet below the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold follows a year of substantial gains for Bitcoin. After Trump took office in January, Bitcoin reached all-time highs above $100,000 in February, buoyed by executive orders aimed at supporting the cryptocurrency sector. However, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price soon mirrored the broader declines in financial markets, particularly after Trump announced severe tariffs in April, which saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $75,000, its lowest point in 2025. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin had seen a resurgence, particularly in May when it reached new highs as Wall Street investors returned to the cryptocurrency through US exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, by late Sunday, there were signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading approximately at $101,300, down only 1% over the previous day, while ETH managed to pare its losses to around $2,200. Forced Liquidations Exacerbate Bitcoin Sell-Off According to CNBC, Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route responsible for approximately 20% of the global oil supply, further adding to the broader financial uncertainty. JPMorgan warned that such a blockade could drive oil prices up to $130 per barrel, which would have significant implications for US inflation, potentially pushing it back toward 5%\u2014a level not seen since March 2023. While Bitcoin has often been promoted as an inflation hedge, its recent behavior aligns more closely with that of high-beta tech stocks. Data from crypto provider Kaiko indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq has increased sharply in recent weeks, particularly following the surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: $312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support Institutional investment patterns have also shifted. More than $1.04 billion flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs from Monday to Wednesday last week, but this momentum dissipated as the weekend approached, with minimal net movement on Thursday and only $6.4 million on Friday. The technical aspects of the market further exacerbated the sell-off. Research from CoinGlass revealed that Bitcoin\u2019s drop below $99,000 triggered forced liquidations across offshore derivatives platforms, including Binance and Bybit. During this period, over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with more than 95% of these coming from long positions, highlighting the market&#8217;s overexposure.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/96k-or-144k-bitcoin-mayer-multiple-chart-price-target-options/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a slight uptick in the last few hours after US President Donald Trump announced a successful airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move aimed at de-escalating rising tensions in the Middle East after several days of conflict between Iran and Israel. Despite the short-term price reaction, BTC remains in a corrective phase, having struggled to break through the $110,000 resistance level over the past month with market sentiment being largely shaped by both global uncertainty and technical stagnation. Amid this backdrop, a crypto analyst with X pseudonym On-Chain College has highlighted two prospective price targets based on on-chain data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800 Market Odds Favor Further Upside For Bitcoin &#8211; Analyst In a recent X post on June 21, On-Chain College shares a positive long-term Bitcoin price outlook using the Mayer Multiple, an on-chain metric that measures relationship between Bitcoin\u2019s price and its 200-day moving average (200DMA). By tracking key valuation bands, the Mayer Multiple helps determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued, based on historical price behavior. Since the bull market commenced in Q4 2024, Bitcoin has consistently moved between 1.0x band i.e. the 200DMA (blue line) and the 1.5x band (orange line) representing the mid price range zone. Notably, the Bitcoin price struggles in the past have generated speculations of potential market top at the current market high. However, the Mayer Multiple chart shows that BTC has only ever attained a cycle price peak after hitting the 2.5x band (red line). Therefore, there is still room for price growth in the current bull market. However, the immediate price targets for premier cryptocurrency lies at $96,000 (1.0x) or $144,000 (1.5x). Notably, there is significant potential to rediscover its bullish form and surge towards $144,000 in line with its defined-range bound movement. However, there are also equal chances of a return to $96,000 which On-Chain College states would aid in flushing out weak hands before a full-scale bullish price reversal. Related Reading: XRP Daily New Addresses Plunge 80% In 2025 \u2014 Bearish On-Chain Metrics Raise Alarm Bitcoin Price Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $102,700 following a 1.50% decline in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the maiden cryptocurrency also reports losses of 2.94% and 8.08% on the weekly and monthly chart, respectively. According to CoinCodex, the general market sentiment remains neutral. However, CoinCodex analysts foresee an impending price breakout with an audacious projection of $136,472 within the next five days. Interestingly, it\u2019s worth noting that this level may represent or come close to the cycle market top, as long-term forecasts include $138,379 in three months and $116,115 in six months.
