      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-channel-break/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has been crashing with the advent of the new week, spurred on by uncertainties that surround the growing conflict in the Middle East. There has also been a lot of negativity in the crypto market, with expectations that the Bitcoin price will not make new all-time highs after failing to reclaim $111,000. Even as the market continues to bleed, crypto analysts are still predicting further crashes for the digital asset, with some expecting a break of the psychological level at $100,000. Bitcoin Price Headed For Further Breakdown Crypto analyst TehThomas had previously called the Bitcoin price crash from the $108,000 territory, suggesting that the digital asset still had to fill Fair Value Gaps (FVG) at lower levels before it could continue to soar. Then recently, the crypto analyst has once again reiterated his stance as the price had begun to fall back toward $100.000. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move Coming? Thomas explained that Bitcoin was already showing signs of exhaustion. Hence, the reason for the crash was due to a loss of $108,500. At this level, with the price failing to break out higher, it showed that the initial surge had been a takeout, and the right direction was actually downward. The initial bullish move was seemingly a way for an internal liquidity grab while clearing out breakout buyers at the same time. Now, the Bitcoin price has broken below an important channel at $105,000 after a successful retest. The analyst explains that this aligns with the 50% equilibrium of the high-to-low range. Naturally, this means that the asset is still bearish and could continue to decline from here. The main levels to watch were initially at $104,600, but the Bitcoin price had first broken below this level on Tuesday. Now, if the decline continues, then the next major level investors are looking at is the $102,800, where support now lies for the cryptocurrency. Below $100,000 Is Still Possible In addition to Thomas, crypto analyst Xanrox has also predicted further price crashes for Bitcoin. He points out that the formation of a bull flag does not mean the price will continue to rise, as the flag could very well break. If this happens, then the analyst sees the Bitcoin price dropping to $100,000. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here\u2019s Why Unlike Thomas, Xanrox places his support levels at the much lower price of $88,000, which would suggest a major price crash from here. \u201cWhen we look at the current price action, it looks like a bullish flag consolidation pattern,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cIn this case we will probably see multiple liquidity sweeps below the previous swing lows to kick out early longs.\u201d Another analyst, Doctor Profit, has also turned bearish, predicting a decline below $100,000. In the X post, the crypto analyst said that the Bitcoin price is likely to fall to the $94,000-$95,000 level before seeing a bounce from there. Therefore, the analyst has told investors to prepare for more red candles. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-warns-strategy-on-track-for-historic-collapse-bigger-than-ftx/",
      "summary": "In a bold and alarming statement, on-chain analyst OxChain raised the possibility of a catastrophic collapse involving Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm co-founded by Michael Saylor. According to OxChain, this potential downfall could surpass the infamous collapse of FTX. \u2018Strategy&#8217;s Bitcoin Tactics Resemble Ponzi Scheme\u2019 In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), OxChain expressed concerns about Strategy&#8217;s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation formula, suggesting that the company&#8217;s operations resemble a Ponzi scheme. OxChain pointed out that since 2020, MicroStrategy has transformed from a traditional software company into a significant player in the Bitcoin market, currently holding around 582,000 BTC, valued at nearly $61 billion. Related Reading: Researchers Forecast Bitcoin At $4.3 Million By 2036, Citing Institutional Demand However, OxChain claims that this impressive figure is underpinned by leverage, debt, and shareholder dilution, rather than genuine conviction in the cryptocurrency. The analyst outlined Strategy&#8217;s approach as a \u201ccyclical financial loop\u201d: the firm raises capital through shares or bonds, purchases Bitcoin, announces these purchases to drive up stock prices, and then raises more funds. The analyst asserts that this cycle has worked as long as Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to rise. However, with plans for a new $1 billion share sale, OxChain believes that Strategy is increasing its risk exposure. Analyst Predicts Major Liquidation Risk OxChain warns that Strategy&#8217;s average cost per Bitcoin is approximately $70,000, creating a precarious situation. The analyst adds that if Bitcoin\u2019s price falls significantly below this level, the company&#8217;s treasury, currently valued at around $25 billion, could quickly start to suffer losses. According to the analyst, despite Saylor&#8217;s public commitment to never sell Bitcoin, the realities of accounting and risk management may force the company to act if market conditions deteriorate. In the first quarter of 2025, Strategy disclosed $5.9 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses, revealing the volatility of its assets. Under the new accounting standard ASC 350-60, the company is required to report fair value, eliminating the ability to hide behind book value. This transparency has already led to legal repercussions, with shareholders filing a class action lawsuit alleging that Strategy concealed the risks associated with Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility while aggressively raising capital. OxChain further claimed during his social media thread that Strategy&#8217;s role as a Bitcoin access point is diminishing, especially as institutional capital flows into \u201cmore transparent and regulated options,\u201d such as BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed around $70 billion in assets under management. The analyst stressed that unlike Strategy, which reportedly faces dilution risks and operates with limited safeguards, IBIT offers a \u201cmore stable investment\u201d for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Altcoin Alert: Expert Reveals Hottest Opportunities For The Summer Season If Strategy were to falter, the implications would be far-reaching, OxChain added. The firm holds approximately 2.77% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply, and a significant liquidation could send shockwaves through the market. The analyst warns that a decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price by just 22% from its average buy price could trigger corporate liquidations, potentially leading to one of the largest liquidation events in history. Ultimately, OxChain cautions that Strategy is neither a hero nor a villain in the crypto ecosystem; instead, he said that it represents a \u201crisk vector heavily reliant on leverage and market sentiment.\u201d Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Solana has declined by around 13% in the past week, which has brought the asset back to a major on-chain support cluster. Could this be where the bleed ends? Solana Has Strong On-Chain Support Between $145 &#38; $147 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about where support and resistance levels lie for Solana based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend\u2014But Can They Keep It Up? The Cost Basis Distribution tells us about how much of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulating supply was last purchased or transferred at what spot price. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the data of the indicator for Solana over the past few months. As is visible, there are a few price zones near the current Solana spot price that stand out in terms of the amount of supply that they hold. The $155 to $157 range carries the cost basis of around 31 million tokens and the $164 to $166 range that of 29 million tokens. A third demand zone exists at $145 to $147, a region that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price is currently making a retest of. Here, the investors last purchased a total of 13 million SOL. To any investor, their cost basis is an important level, so they are more likely to show some kind of move when a retest of it occurs. Generally, this type of reaction isn&#8217;t anything relevant for the asset when just a few holders share their acquisition mark at the level, but when a large amount of them are involved, like in the case of the range that SOL is retesting right now, a sizeable reaction can sometimes appear. Generally, these moves tend toward buying when the retest occurs from above. That is, when the investors were in the green prior to the retest. This happens because these holders might believe the price decline to be just a dip opportunity or they may simply want to protect their cost basis. Similarly, holders might panic sell when the retest happens from below. This could happen because underwater sellers can be desperate to get back into the green and once they do, they might fear that the rise is only temporary so they could push for the exit. As Solana is retesting the $145 to $147 range from above, it&#8217;s possible that buyers from this region could provide support to the asset and help cushion its fall. In the event that a turnaround does happen, the $155 to $157 resistance range could be of focus next. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued? The analytics firm has also shared the CBD of another altcoin, Tron (TRX). As Glassnode explains, Cost Basis Distribution shows TRON found support in the $0.26\u2013$0.27 range, where over 14B $TRX is held -marking the strongest cluster on the chart. Above that, the supply is relatively thin and most investor positioning remains below current price. SOL Price Solana is currently hanging right at the lower end of the support range as its price is floating around $145.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-stalls-at-2500-but-is-a-4000-breakout-closer-than-you-think/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has struggled to maintain upward momentum following a brief rally that pushed its price above $2,800 last week. Currently, ETH is trading at $2,511, reflecting a 9.4% decline over the past week. This retreat comes amid a broader period of consolidation across the digital asset market, with Ethereum seeing both technical resistance levels and on-chain trends that could shape its price action in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching \u2013 Will History Repeat? Ethereum Faces Technical Resistance The latest analysis from \u0130brahim CO\u015eAR, a contributor to CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, highlights the significance of the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) as a resistance level for ETH. Historically, successful breakouts above this technical marker have been followed by substantial price gains. CO\u015eAR notes that in prior cycles, once ETH crossed above the 50-week EMA, price increases ranged from 25% to 135%. Averaging those moves suggests a breakout could see Ethereum targeting the $4,000 range. The EMA is a trend-following indicator that places more weight on recent price action, often used to identify potential breakout or breakdown zones in asset movements. Staking and Accumulation Metrics Show Investor Conviction In parallel to price action, Ethereum\u2019s staking metrics continue to show steady growth. On-chain analyst OnChainSchool reported that more than 500,000 ETH were staked in the first half of June, bringing the total staked to over 35 million ETH. This milestone represents the highest amount ever locked in Ethereum&#8217;s proof-of-stake contract and reflects a growing trend toward network participation and supply reduction. Staking, in ETH\u2019s case, involves locking ETH to help secure the network and validate transactions in return for staking rewards. As the amount of ETH staked rises, the liquid circulating supply shrinks, potentially tightening available supply on exchanges. Additionally, accumulation wallets, or addresses with no history of selling, have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH. Combined, these metrics point toward long-term holding behavior, rather than speculative trading. Ethereum Hits ATH in Staking: Over 35 Million ETH Locked \u201cAlongside this, Accumulation Addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH.\u201d \u2013 By @onchainschool Read more \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/WYoX9qpODZ pic.twitter.com/6MAlK0sCfJ \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 17, 2025 These on-chain developments coincide with ongoing interest in Ethereum-based financial products.
