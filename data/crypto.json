      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s six-month consolidation is a coil, not a coffin, according to the pseudonymous technician Cantonese Cat, whose 19 June video marshals multiple time-frame evidence to argue that the meme-coin\u2019s next directional break will be up\u2014potentially as far as $4.13 before the current cycle tops out. Dogecoin Breakout Is Only A Matter Of Time The analyst begins by addressing sentiment. Retail comment threads have turned caustic, he notes, because price has slipped from last autumn\u2019s spike and then \u201cdone nothing for months.\u201d Yet such fatigue is precisely what bull-market retracements are meant to produce: \u201cA lot of people are getting really bitter about Doge \u2026 that\u2019s exactly how higher highs and higher low type situations are supposed to get you all frustrated. This is still a bull trend until proven otherwise.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like \u2018It Wants To Play Dead\u2019\u2014Again At the highest zoom level, Dogecoin is tracing what he calls \u201cstill a cup and \u2026 still a handle until proven otherwise.\u201d The first thrust of that handle halted almost exactly at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement of the 2022\u201324 bear range\u2014\u201ca very important fib level here.\u201d Because initial attempts rarely pierce that resistance, he expected rejection. What matters is where the pullback found support: \u201cIn the case of Dogecoin, it decided to go all the way down to 0.382, which is nothing unusual \u2026 this is actually a pretty important zone of this nice Adam-and-Eve double bottom.\u201d The market is therefore testing, not violating, an historically powerful neckline. Zooming to the monthly chart, Dogecoin sits beneath what the analyst calls \u201ca pretty thick Ichimoku cloud.\u201d Two breakout attempts have failed, producing a pair of wicks that look ominous to casual chart watchers. Cantonese Cat disagrees: \u201cWe had a little bit of a false breakout here on the monthly \u2026 I think a third time is going to be the charm.\u201d Beneath the cloud, six consecutive monthly candles have nested entirely inside the tall green bar printed last November. He interprets the formation\u2014six inside bars\u2014as latency building for a violent move: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about consolidation with six inside candles forming a lot of energy here.\u201d That compression is mirrored on the weekly time frame: \u201cIf you also look at the weekly here, you can also see that you have six inside candles over here too \u2026 that tells me that there is not much bearish energy necessarily left anymore. I think we\u2019re closer to the bottom than the top.\u201d Key structural support is supplied by a rising 20-month simple moving average, now at $0.1737. Price currently ticks below it, but the slope is still positive. Historically, such combinations resolve in favour of the trend: \u201cIf you have a 20-month moving average that is up-sloping, most likely this is just going to be a wick.\u201d He cites an earlier cycle when Dogecoin wicked beneath the same metric before staging a dramatic reversal. Price action, he argues, is meaningless without context. \u201cIf I end up looking at Doge here on Coinbase and I pull up the volume here, you can also see that there is no selling volume here at all.\u201d Binance, the world\u2019s deepest Dogecoin market, shows identical inertia. \u201cThe selling volume is essentially non-existent,\u201d he says, concluding that supply overhang has vaporised and only demand is required to propel a reversal. Twice before\u2014in July 2023 and February 2024\u2014identical volume droughts preceded V-shaped rallies: \u201cLow selling volume over here, reversal once volume comes in \u2026 low selling volume over here, reversal once volume comes in.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Shows Signs Of Life With Bottoming Signal Daily-chart oscillators are beginning to corroborate the structural read. Dogecoin has just registered what Cantonese Cat labels a \u201ctreasure bottom\u201d\u2014his term for a localised capitulation whose candle body is far smaller than its wick. More formally, the relative-strength index has exhibited bullish divergence: price has etched lower lows while RSI turns higher. \u201cLast time when you have some bullish diversions was right here \u2026 that was the local bottom right there,\u201d he says, pointing to the October 2023 reversal. The pattern repeated in March 2024 and appears again today: \u201cI think that we might be experiencing a trend change here relatively soon.\u201d DOGE Price Targets Should volume arrive and price claw back through the 0.5 and 0.618 retracements, Cantonese Cat\u2019s Fibonacci ladders flag successive targets. From the Binance dataset, \u201c$1.60, $2.26 and $4.13, all of these are possibility for Dogecoin.\u201d A composite feed of multiple exchanges tweaks the numbers to $1.50, $2.27 and $3.94. What he does not foresee is a reprise of 2021\u2019s parabolic blow-off, when Dogecoin tagged the 2.272 extension and briefly suggested a trajectory towards $23. \u201cI think that $23 doge is insane \u2026 I don\u2019t think that doge is going to end up becoming, you know, like anything like $3 trillion market cap.\u201d A quarter- to half-trillion-dollar capitalisation, however\u2014roughly the price zone between three and four dollars\u2014remains \u201csomething to think about\u201d given current monetary expansion. Cantonese Cat interprets the community\u2019s malaise as a contrarian gift: \u201cThe market makers are giving us more time to buy while the sentiment is extremely, extremely poor.\u201d Inside-bar ranges serve as a simple trigger. A close above the six-month range high would, in his reading, unlock the primary up-trend\u2019s next leg. Conversely, a close below the 20-month average might delay\u2014but not necessarily invalidate\u2014the thesis, provided the moving average itself keeps rising. Across every lens\u2014the macro cup-and-handle, the Adam-and-Eve neckline test, Ichimoku resistance, 20-month moving average support, volume exhaustion, daily bullish divergence\u2014the weight of evidence converges on a bullish outcome. Timing, he concedes, is unknowable: \u201cWhen is that going to be? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Yet none of the data justify capitulation. He closes with the maxim he repeats three times in the broadcast: \u201cThe trend is your friend, and the trend is up.\u201d If that view holds, Dogecoin\u2019s dormant coil may eventually unwind toward the analyst\u2019s most ambitious extension at $4.13\u2014a level unthinkable to today\u2019s demoralised sellers, and precisely for that reason, he argues, still within reach. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.171. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arizona-hb2324-bitcoin-reserve-fund/",
      "summary": "Arizona\u2019s Senate has moved to revive a bill that will create the state\u2019s crypto reserve fund. This growing attention to the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency further adds interest to related new cryptos, such as BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and secure crypto wallets like Best Wallet. Arizona\u2019s House Bill 2324 is now under reconsideration after the Senate voted 16-14 to revive it. The House of Representatives initially voted down the bill in May. What Arizona\u2019s HB2324 is About HB2324 expands Arizona\u2019s ability to seize and forfeit property that has been used or obtained through criminal activity to include crypto and other digital assets. The state will then sell the forfeited digital asset. The bill also clarifies the role of Arizona\u2019s \u2018Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund,\u2019 wherein the state will deposit 25% of any seized digital assets worth over $300K. In May, Arizona created the reserve fund to store unclaimed digital assets, making it one of the first US states to do so. Why HB2324 Matters The revival of HB2324 signals the US\u2019s push to add $BTC and other crypto to its finances. Aside from Arizona, other states have created similar crypto reserves, including New Hampshire and Texas. This growing momentum highlights a broader trend: US states no longer wait for federal guidance to make crypto moves. Instead, they\u2019re taking matters into their own hands, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed as a strategic asset rather than a speculative gamble. By actively building reserves in digital assets, states like Arizona and New Hampshire are positioning themselves at the forefront of a financial shift, diversifying treasuries, hedging against inflation, and embracing innovation as a competitive advantage. The 3 Best New Crypto to Buy as Bitcoin Adoption Grows With government institutions and Wall Street starting to embrace $BTC and other digital assets more openly, here are three new crypto that could benefit from this development: 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 A Secure Way to Store Your Bitcoin and Other Crypto With crypto becoming more mainstream, there\u2019s a growing demand for a secure crypto wallet where people can store their valuable digital assets. That\u2019s the demand that Best Wallet wants to meet. This crypto wallet lets you store, buy, and stake crypto and a lot more. It even has a Token Launchpad where you can access the best presales while they\u2019re still cheap. As a non-custodial crypto wallet, Best Wallet gives you sole control over your private keys. This makes it more secure compared to wallets where private keys are in the hands of the wallet provider. It\u2019s also a no-KYC crypto wallet, meaning it doesn\u2019t require you to undergo the know-your-customer (KYC) verification, which helps maintain your privacy. Behind the wallet is its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST). It\u2019s currently on presale, which you can get for only $0.025205 each. Our Best Wallet Token buying guide has all the details you need to grab $BEST tokens. Owning the token has various advantages. These include getting low transaction fees within the Best Wallet ecosystem, higher staking rewards, early access to presales in the Token Launchpad, and governance rights that give you control over the project\u2019s direction. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BEST) \u2013 Buy BTC Bull Tokens, Get the Chance to Receive Free Bitcoins As the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2019s value is on its way to new highs. That\u2019s the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) team\u2019s rallying cry as it urges believers to push $BTC to $250K and beyond. At its heart are the free $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrops when Bitcoin hits price milestones. This means when you hold $BTCBULL, you\u2019ll get the chance to receive Bitcoins when it hits $150K and $200K. Then, when it finally reaches $250K, you\u2019ll get free BTC Bull tokens. The team will also have regular token burns happening at $125K, $175K, and $225K. These will help reduce the number of $BTCBULL in circulation, making them scarcer and more valuable. The token is currently available for $0.00257 each at the BTC Bull Token presale page. To buy tokens, connect your crypto wallet like Best Wallet to the presale widget, enter the number of coins you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. If you prefer, you can stake tokens after you buy them and enjoy staking rewards that are currently set at 56% p.a. HODLing could also be an ideal strategy, as it could be worth as much as $0.0096 each. 3. Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) \u2013 Merging the World of Bitcoin and Meme Coins Bitcoin was never meant for the world of meme coins, that is, until Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) arrived. By creating a Layer 2 blockchain, the Bitcoin Pepe team aims to merge Bitcoin with meme coins. When completed, this will deliver the best that Solana has to offer\u2014speed, low transaction fees, and user-friendly UX\u2014and bank on the biggest crypto&#8217;s massive value and mainstream appeal. $BPEP is available for $0.0416 on the Bitcoin Pepe presale page. But with just 10 days before the presale closes, it\u2019s your last chance to get the tokens at a discount. Crypto Has Gone Mainstream and There\u2019s No Looking Back With the revival of HB2324 in Arizona, Bitcoin and other crypto are back in the spotlight. While this is still big news at the moment, it will be a matter of time before it completely becomes a part of the mainstream. Because of this, it\u2019s always best to be a step ahead of the crowd, such as by getting a secure crypto wallet powered by Best Wallet Token ($BEST) or betting on Bitcoin\u2019s bull run with BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). But before you invest in crypto, make sure you do your research. This will allow you to be aware of the opportunities as well as the risks of trading these digital assets. Also, use the information in this article for educational purposes and not as investment advice."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/itcoin-breakdown-if-this-continues-it-snaps/",
      "summary": "Bearish sentiment on X continues to grow, fueling a rising number of crash forecasts. Among them is Dom (@traderview2), a widely followed crypto market analyst, who issued a stark warning on Wednesday: Bitcoin is approaching a structural tipping point that could trigger a severe breakdown if bulls fail to act swiftly. \u201cIf this continues, it snaps,\u201d Dom cautioned, referring to a wave of relentless selling pressure and thinning liquidity across major exchanges. Time Is Ticking For Bitcoin In a detailed post, Dom described current market conditions as \u201cvital,\u201d noting that Bitcoin and the broader crypto space are at a moment where \u201cit needs to save itself or we&#8217;re going south.\u201d The recent weekly chart, he said, reflects a bearish \u201cliquidity grab\u201d\u2014a move where BTC pushed above the previous weekly high only to sharply reverse, a pattern often marking local tops. That reversal has been accompanied by a three-touch declining strength formation, signaling fading bullish momentum. \u201cI think time is ticking for bulls to save this chart, as it needs to happen soon IMO,\u201d Dom added, underscoring the urgency of a bullish reclaim to invalidate the setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is The Purest AI Trade, Says Wall Street Veteran Beneath price action, the structural foundation appears increasingly fragile. Dom pointed to alarmingly thin order books across key spot markets\u2014Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken. Over the past three weeks, roughly 38,000 BTC has been sold into the market, absorbed by passive bids. While buyers have held so far, the analyst warned that visible liquidity beneath current price levels is virtually nonexistent. \u201cThere is virtually no support down to 80ks (at least as of now), not even advertisement of support,\u201d he said. The same bearish pattern is playing out in perpetual futures markets. Platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Hyperliquid have seen consistent taker-side selling, forming what Dom described as a \u201crelentless downtrend of market selling.\u201d With perp books also thin, the pressure may be unsustainable unless conditions change quickly. Drawing a parallel to Bitcoin\u2019s February breakdown from the 90k level, Dom noted, \u201cWe saw the same dynamic pre-90k breakdown.\u201d The implication is clear: without a shift in market behavior, BTC may be headed toward a similar fate. Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin Now? Not Yet\u2014Analyst Says Time Holds The Key Seasonal trends are adding weight to the bearish outlook. Dom highlighted that summer months historically bring weaker market participation and lower liquidity\u2014an environment that exacerbates downside moves and limits the impact of bullish efforts to regain control. Despite the grim analysis, Dom remains clear on what would invalidate his bearish stance: a recovery of the 108.5k level. \u201cIf that level regains, great. I think we can void these signals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for now, bearish outlook for me is the better R/R on a risk-first basis.\u201d In a separate reply, Dom acknowledged that a dip to the $96,000\u2013$98,000 region, even with a wick into the $80,000\u2019s, would not necessarily break structure. \u201cIt surely would not be abnormal and I think structure would still be ok,\u201d he wrote, adding that he would reassess the setup if such a move occurs. With order books thinning, taker flow intensifying, and no solid support beneath, Dom\u2019s message is blunt: time is running out. At press time, BTC traded at $104,694.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-crash-2000/",
      "summary": "While the Bitcoin price stays close to its all-time highs, the Ethereum price has done pretty much the opposite. This failure to perform has put intense bearish pressure on the altcoin market as a whole, and the resulting price action has triggered what is seemingly a bear market for altcoins. Even now, the Ethereum price has not shown any signs of a bullish recovery, with expectations remaining bleak at this level, and analysts predicting further crashes. Why The Ethereum Price Is Headed Below $2,000 Crypto analyst Maddox Metrics has given the short and long-term outlook for the Ethereum price, and it seems the current market decline is nowhere near its end. In the short term, Maddox expects the Ethereum price to continue to decline and, in fact, fall below some major support levels. Related Reading: XRP Addresses Holding 1M Coins Reach 12-Year High As Experts Predict Move Above $4 As the crypto analyst explains, investors are already expecting the ETH price to actually fall lower toward the $1,900 target. And as shown in the analyst\u2019s chart, this would actually be the second wave of the 5-wave count as Ethereum moves into its long-term potential. While there has been a lot of buying, especially among institutional investors and ETF issuers, the Ethereum price continues to trend low. The analyst attributes this to the rising war tensions in the Middle East, as fears of World War 3 grow more intense. At this level, the analyst cautions investors to look toward a more patient strategy, saying that \u201cMoney is made in the sitting, weathering volatility, not flipping in and out of trades on every bit of news and price movement.\u201d Thus, it is better to hold positions until the market finds its stable point. ETH Still Bullish In The Long-Term Despite the wave pattern pointing to a crash below $2,000 in the short term, the analyst says the long-term outlook for the Ethereum price remains bullish. The current decline, which is a Wave 2 retracement, the analyst explains, marked the end of a motif wave at the $2,700 resistance. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Price Set To Repeat History As 2017 Playbook Returns? Why This Time Could Be Bigger This suggests that once the current wave ends, there is the next wave, which is the bullish Wave 3. Once this is underway, the analyst\u2019s chart shows a possibility of this wave carrying through to a new all-time high just under $5,000. The 4th wave is naturally bearish and will trigger a crash, while the 5th and final wave will send the Ethereum price to $7,000. The timeline for this to happen, as shown in the chart, will be through the year 2025 and into the early months of 2026. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "Solana Correction About To End? Analyst Forecasts $130 Retest Before Next Wave Up",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-correction-about-to-end-analyst-forecasts-130-retest-before-next-wave-up/",
      "summary": "Amid the geopolitical turmoil, Solana (SOL) has retraced 10% in the past week. Some analysts believe that the altcoin\u2019s correction is about to end, but warned that a dip below a key support level might come first. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For New Highs As Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $5 Solana Eyes Key Retest Before Breakout After retesting the $168 resistance last Wednesday, Solana has fallen back to a key level fueled by the recent market pullback. The cryptocurrency has seen a 15% retracement from its monthly highs, trading around the $140 zone for the past three days. SOL has been hovering between the $145-$180 price range since its May breakout, falling to the range lows during the June market shakeouts. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to reclaim the $160-$170 mid-zone. Nonetheless, market watcher Lluciano considers that Solana \u201cmay dip a bit more, but the ultimate target is seriously huge.\u201d The analyst highlighted SOL\u2019s performance since April, noting that it ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March. After this price action, SOL retested the $100-$120 demand zone before breaking out to its current range in the following weeks. Now, the altcoin\u2019s chart displays a one-month falling wedge pattern, with the upper boundary sitting around the $155-$160 area. To the analyst, a breakout from this pattern could send the cryptocurrency toward May\u2019s $187 high resistance before propelling the price to retest the $240 mark. Similarly, trader Rose noted that SOL has been consolidating above the key $145 resistance and 50-day Moving Average (MA), signaling a potential breakout. \u201cIf confirmed, the price could rise toward targets at $165, $183, and $220,\u201d they suggested. SOL To Underperform In Coming Months? Market watcher Crypto Bullet suggested that Solana\u2019s correction is coming to an end. The analyst forecasted that SOL could soon lose its current range and retest the April consolidation range, around the $125-$135 area, to complete the correction. This would be followed by a bounce back into the current range before surging past the $200 barrier toward the $220-$250 targets, for \u201cone more wave up\u201d this cycle. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa affirmed Solana won\u2019t outperform like it did during the first half of the cycle. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency won\u2019t outperform Bitcoin (BTC) on any long-term timeframe \u201cother than a few blips here and there.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Setting Up For \u2018Large Move\u2019 Amid $103,000 Retest \u2013 Key Levels To Watch He explained that the cycle\u2019s leading altcoin isn\u2019t \u201cdead,\u201d but that he doesn\u2019t \u201csee it having a run like it did in 2021/2024.\u201d Notably, SOL is currently retesting its late November 2023 support levels against BTC, which previously sent it to yearly lows after failing to hold them. Altcoin Sherpa concluded that Solana will likely continue to climb against its USDT pair but continue to bleed in its SOL/BTC chart. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $145, a 12.1% decline in the monthly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"
