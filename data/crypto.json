      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s available coins for trading have dropped sharply. That change could push prices higher if demand holds up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge According to Sygnum Bank\u2019s June 2025 Monthly Investment Outlook, the liquid supply of Bitcoin fell by about 30% over the last 18 months. In that time, nearly 1 million BTC left exchanges. That means fewer coins are ready to move at a moment\u2019s notice. Liquid Supply Tightens Based on reports from Sygnum Bank, exchange balances dropped by around 1 million BTC since late 2023. That amount equals roughly 5% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply. When coins leave exchanges, they often go into cold storage or long-term funds. Some of these funds include new exchange-traded funds and corporate buyers issuing equity or debt to buy Bitcoin. If coins are locked away, traders have to compete for a smaller pool of available coins. That gap between supply and demand can cause bigger price swings on the upside. Institutions And State Moves Three US states have now passed laws to hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves. New Hampshire already signed its bill into law. Texas is expected to follow soon. A third state is also moving forward, though details are still pending. In addition, governments abroad are paying attention. Pakistan\u2019s government has said it will look into Bitcoin reserves. In the UK, the Reform Party\u2014currently leading in election polls\u2014plans to study something similar. When a state or country actually buys Bitcoin for its coffers, it can spark more buying. That act has a double effect: it creates immediate demand and it signals that public institutions see Bitcoin as a store of value. Safe-Haven Status Strengthens Rising uncertainty over the US dollar and US debt worries have driven some investors toward Bitcoin. In May, as US Treasury prices slid on concerns about rising debt levels, digital gold and physical gold saw higher interest. Bitcoin is being viewed more like a hedge against dollar weakness. On days when Treasuries wobble, some cash moves into crypto markets. Larger swings on the upside than on the downside also hint that institutions may be soaking up dips more quickly. Sygnum\u2019s data shows that since June 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s upward moves have been larger than its downward moves. That may be a sign that big players have become more confident in holding through small sell-offs.

When more institutions issue tokenized assets, the whole crypto space could benefit. Renewed activity on Ethereum often spills back into Bitcoin. That could add to overall demand for top coins.

      "summary": "Bitcoin is drifting just above $105,000 on June 5, its lowest realized volatility in almost two years, yet Swan, the Los-Angeles-based \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d financial services firm, contends the market is on the verge of its most radical re-pricing ever. The Last Chance To Buy? In a X thread on Wednesday night, the company argued that the familiar four-year boom-and-bust cadence is giving way to \u201cthe last rotation\u201d\u2014a silent transfer of coins from retail speculators to institutions whose investment horizons stretch decades. \u201cPeople less committed to the long term are exiting [\u2026] and a whole new class of investors is entering,\u201d Swan is quoting Michael Saylor, framing the hand-off from retail traders to corporate treasuries, ETFs and multinationals such as BlackRock and Fidelity. So far, 2025 has defied the script. The third calendar year of every prior cycle\u20142013, 2017 and 2021\u2014delivered the vertical moves that defined those eras. This year has offered \u201cbig moves, but also shallower corrections and longer periods of sideways chop,\u201d Swan writes, conceding that the price action \u201cis boring people.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Strength As Long-Term Holder Realized Cap Surges Past $20 Billion \u2013 Details The firm\u2019s thesis is that boredom masks an invisible supply squeeze: long-time holders taking profits above $100,000 while \u201clong-only buyers,\u201d in Swan\u2019s words, methodically absorb the float. \u201cThese corporations, they\u2019re long-only buyers. Not traders of Bitcoin,\u201d Swan argues, underscoring the firm\u2019s view that coins migrating into corporate vaults are effectively removed from circulation. The thread portrays three intertwined rotations: Between entities \u2013 Trustees, lawyers and early adopters are exiting; ETFs, corporations and \u201csovereign-grade balance sheets\u201d are stepping in. Between intentions \u2013 Speculation gives way to allocation. \u201cThis new wave of buyers isn\u2019t speculating,\u201d Swan writes. \u201cThey\u2019re allocating.\u201d Between generations. The Silent Generation hoarded gold; Boomers compounded in equities; Gen X surfed tech; now Millennials, \u201centering their peak accumulation years,\u201d are \u201cinheriting trillions\u2014and they\u2019re choosing Bitcoin.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Pauses Below $106K as Analyst Reveals Key Support Level To Watch Supply dynamics, Swan contends, make those rotations irreversible. \u201cWhen long-term capital meets inelastic supply, the float starts vanishing,\u201d the firm warns. \u201cThat\u2019s when things get explosive.\u201d The macro backdrop adds pressure: Swan points to a \u201crare and dangerous split\u201d in which the US dollar is weakening even as bond yields surge\u2014an environment, it says, that could funnel excess capital toward a neutral store of value. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just the next cycle. It\u2019s the end of an era,\u201d Swan concludes. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling now, understand you\u2019re likely handing your Bitcoin to an institution that plans to hold it indefinitely. Once it\u2019s gone, you\u2019re probably never getting it back.\u201d For Swan, the implication is stark. The apparent tranquility near $105,000 is less a sign of exhaustion than the quiet before a permanent liquidity event\u2014one in which the marginal seller disappears, the marginal buyer never sells, and price must eventually mark higher to find equilibrium. \u201cThink twice,\u201d Swan advises would-be profit-takers. \u201cThe float is drying up. The buyers are built different. This is the last Bitcoin rotation.\u201d If the firm is right, history is not repeating so much as culminating, and the market\u2019s current stillness may soon be remembered as the eye of a generational storm.

      "summary": "Solana\u2019s out to rebuild a digital empire, and it\u2019s doing it from an office building in Lower Manhattan. Having a physical headquarters might seem a bit counter-intuitive for a company focused on digital assets. But the move is fueling an ongoing shift at Solana Labs, from Solana the meme coin chain to Solana as a serious, \u2018Wall-Street-ready\u2019 DeFi chain. The offices opened back in 2023, and Solana Labs uses them as a staging board where potential partners and investors can come visit and chat directly with Solana\u2019s devs. The move is paying off; even as more and more companies adapt a \u2018Bitcoin reserve\u2019 strategy to use with $SOL. What does it all mean? Even as Solana takes aim at becoming the go-to blockchain for finance, top crypto presales set out to build on the blend of memes and finance provided by the Solana chain. Solana: Go-To Blockchain for Finance? Major companies like Upexi, Inc ($UPXI) are taking Michael Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin reserve strategy and applying it to Solana. Upexi purchased 77,879 $SOL, giving it a total of 679,677 $SOL valued at $121M. The company has gained roughly $24.5M from token appreciation so far, aided by a good month, performance-wise, from $SOL itself. Upexi isn\u2019t the only company looking to capitalize on Solana\u2019s success: SkyBridge Capital, led by Anthony Scaramucci, poured $50M into a Solana Staking ETF in Canada Apollo and Securitize partnered to launch tokenized credit funds on Solana and other blockchains SOL Strategies announced a $500M investment to facilitate SOL token acquisitions and partnerships Classover, an education company, will issue up to $500M in convertible notes to build a SOL treasury That\u2019s a lot of money starting to pour into Solana&#8217;s potential as a financial tool, instead of a simple platform for spamming new meme coins. Of course, degens being what they are, meme coins are still being spammed. A lot of them. A million of them, actually, just in May alone on Solana. Most of those launches fail almost immediately. But the sheer volume of new tokens launched demonstrates continued interest in Solana\u2019s speed and low fees, ideal factors for meme coin success. With a pump.fun token launch likely incoming, it\u2019s not like Solana\u2019s abandoning the meme coin world altogether. Instead, some of the most promising new crypto projects bring both sectors together. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Find 100x Opportunities On Telegram with Snorter Bot With so many tokens launching all the time, the question isn\u2019t \u2018will there be a 100x token.\u2019 The real question is \u2013 how do you find it? That\u2019s where the Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Snorter Bot come in. Tons of Solana meme coins never make it to big CEX listings or major news coverage. Instead, they\u2019re traded on Telegram groups. If they do make it big, the best opportunities for buying low and selling high are long gone. Finding these underground opportunities takes a lot of effort, but thankfully, the Snorter Bot simplifies it all. Safety features like honeypot detection and rugpull alerts help minimize losses, while automated sniping and copy trading let you sniff out and snag the best opportunities. It\u2019s all powered by the $SNORT token, the native utility token for the Snorter Bot. This isn\u2019t a meme coin; it\u2019s a sophisticated trading bot designed to sort through the millions of Solana memes and find the real winners. That utility is driving a wave of interest in $SNORT, with well over $400K raised so far. The presale is in the early days, which makes it the perfect time to buy and stake your $SNORT tokens for an estimated 735% dynamic APY. Buy and stake now, claim your rewards at the token launch, and they\u2019ll be disbursed block-by-block over the next year. A full quarter of the token supply is reserved for product development, powering $SNORT into the future of Solana\u2019s meme coin development. Will the Snorter Bot Bridge the Gap Between Memes and Finance? With millions of dollars flowing into Solana and the $SOL token as a strategic reserve, there\u2019s room for a token that stays true to Solana\u2019s meme coin roots while also looking to the finance future. Do your own research \u2013 you\u2019ll need to decide for yourself. But given Solana\u2019s trajectory, $SNORT could be positioned perfectly. Don\u2019t miss out."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-crash-0-2/",
      "summary": "Following the Bitcoin price sweep down below the $104,000 level over the weekend, the Dogecoin price was pushed back down below $0.2 once again. This move understandably shocked the community as the $0.2 has held for a long time. However, using the 4-hour order block (OB), a crypto analyst has explained what is going on with the Dogecoin price, why the decline happened, and where it could be headed next. Dogecoin Price Experienced A Liquidity Sweep Crypto analyst Smart Flows, on the TradingView website, pointed out an interesting development on the Dogecoin price chart. This showed a clear delineation for why the meme coin\u2019s price dropped below the $0.2 psychological support level, and it came down to something as clean as a liquidity sweep. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Headed For Crash To $2,000 With Current Price Action The crypto analyst uses the 4-Hour order block on the Dogecoin price chart to explain this, starting just above the $0.22 price level. This saw a liquidity sweep through the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at the 0.5 Fibonacci level, breaking through the $0.2 support. This move, Smart Flows explains, was in no way emotional and was more of a \u2018mechanical\u2019 move, suggesting it was engineered to happen. The outcome of this liquidity sweep is that there has now been a reset of sentiment surrounding the Dogecoin price, setting the stage for a potential reversal. If this is the case, then Dogecoin may be sitting on the cusp of what could be the next major rally above $0.2. What To Expect Next From Here According to the crypto analyst, Dogecoin is now sitting in a 4-Hour demand order block zone that is in confluence with the Fair Value Gap (FVG) above $0.2. This makes the $0.20928 level the first \u201ckey reaction point,\u201d and the analyst points out two possibilities for the meme coin here: either the price continues to stall or consolidation begins at this level. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Community Should Pay Attention To June 4-6, Here\u2019s Why Basically, the Dogecoin price has to be able to beat the first major test at $0.209 before moving higher from here. This means it must complete a clean clearance of the FVG to grab liquidity above. After this, the real test begins at $0.22094, where the next major 4-Hour order block sits. The analyst explains that being able to clear the FVG will mean a continuation model is in play. However, there is still the possibility that the Dogecoin price is rejected before it is able to clear the FVG above $0.2. In this case, it could signal a further downtrend for the altcoin. \u201cIf we reject early \u2014 that tells me distribution is starting, and I\u2019ll prep for a secondary sweep below 0.18 to retest the deeper 4H OB near 0.16387,\u201d the analyst concluded.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the large Bitcoin investors have added to their holdings in the past week, a sign that could be bullish for BTC&#8217;s price. Bitcoin Investors With 10 To 10,000 BTC Have Added To Their Holdings In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 BTC investors. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us about the total number of tokens that a particular wallet group is carrying right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Fails To Hype Retail\u2014Demand Is Actually Down Addresses or investors are placed into these cohorts based on the size of their balance. For example, the 1 to 10 coins group includes all holders owning between 1 and 10 tokens of the cryptocurrency. In the context of the current discussion, the groups lying inside the 10 to 10,000 BTC range are of interest. This wide range includes some of the key holders of the sector like the sharks and whales. These investors own significant holdings, so their behavior can often be worth keeping an eye on. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution of the 10 to 10,000 BTC holders over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 BTC investors has registered a significant jump over the past week, implying this group has purchased a net number of coins. More specifically, the members of the cohort have collectively added 79,244 BTC to their wallets in this period. At the current exchange rate, this amount converts to a whopping $8.3 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3\u20135 Year Holders Slow Selloff\u2014Waiting for Higher Prices? From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that this accumulation from the key investors has arrived while BTC has been going down after forming a new all-time high (ATH). This could be a potential indication that these holders still believe in the rally and see this drawdown as just a dip opportunity. That said, the 10 to 10,000 range is a bit wide, so while it does include the big-money investors, it also mixes up their behavior with some of the less-significant hands. Fortunately for Bitcoin, it would appear that the whales (1,000 to 10,000 BTC) agree with this trend of buying, as the chart shared by analyst Ali Martinez implies. As displayed in the graph, the whales of the cryptocurrency have added around 30,000 tokens to their holdings during the past few days, meaning that it&#8217;s not just the mid-sized hands buying this dip. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $105,200, down over 2% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com"
