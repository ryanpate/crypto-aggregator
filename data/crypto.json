      "summary": "Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital opened its Monday note with a blunt assessment: \u201cImplied vols continue to come under pressure, with BTC stuck in a tight range as summer approaches.\u201d In the options house\u2019s telling, the market is drifting into the northern-hemisphere holiday season much as it did a year ago, when one-month at-the-money (ATM) volatility collapsed from 80 vols in March to barely 40 vols by July and spot repeatedly \u201cfailed to decisively breach the $70k level.\u201d The difference this year is the new, higher plateau: BTC has sat between $100,000 and $110,000 for most of the past three weeks. The calm is visible beyond Deribit\u2019s options screens. Deribit\u2019s DVOL index, which tracks 30-day implied volatility, is hovering just above 40\u2014one of its lowest prints in more than two years. Realised volatility is even quieter, so even one-year lows on implieds still look \u201coptically rich,\u201d QCP argues. That valuation gap has encouraged traders to sell gamma: perpetual open interest has slipped and the favourite hedge-fund basis trade\u2014long spot via the new ETFs, short futures\u2014has unwound, taking what QCP calls \u201cthe natural bid for vol\u201d out of the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $97,000 Cost Basis Holds Key To Next Breakout Flows in the listed options market confirm the malaise. Dealers report that July upside strikes around $130,000 and $140,000 are being rolled out to September \u201cin meaningful size,\u201d effectively pushing bullish timelines further down the curve. Meanwhile, Deribit\u2019s put-skew has flattened as short-dated hedges expire worthless\u2014a dynamic that often precedes a directional move once macro catalysts arrive. This Week Could Break Bitcoin\u2019s Lull Those catalysts line up uncomfortably close. On Wednesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish May consumer-price data. April\u2019s headline CPI rose a modest 0.2% month-on-month and 2.3% year-on-year, while core prices advanced 0.2% on the month and 2.8% on the year. Economists look for headline CPI to quicken to 0.3% on the month and 2.5% year-on-year, with core CPI seen edging up to 0.3% and 2.9% respectively. Producer prices follow on Thursday: April\u2019s PPI fell 0.5% on the month yet still printed 2.4% year-on-year. The consensus expects May PPI to rebound 0.2%, leaving the annual rate near 2.4%. Inflation is not the only macro variable in play. Friday\u2019s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report\u2014139,000 jobs versus a 130,000 consensus\u2014rekindled dollar strength and knocked gold more than one percent lower, but BTC \u201cremained conspicuously unmoved,\u201d QCP noted. The same divergence is visible this morning: US equity futures are slightly softer, spot gold is bid on safe-haven demand, and bitcoin is trading virtually unchanged. Geopolitics may supply the spark that inflation data has so far failed to ignite. Senior US and Chinese officials meet in London today (Monday) in what both sides are calling a push for a limited trade deal that would dial back export-control threats and myriad retaliatory tariffs. The talks matter for crypto because tariffs have been feeding directly into the CPI basket and\u2014via global risk sentiment\u2014into bitcoin demand. \u201cA clean break below $100k or above $110k would likely reawaken broader market interest,\u201d QCP wrote, \u201cbut we currently see no obvious near-term catalyst to drive such a move.\u201d Trade headlines could change that calculus in a single newsflash. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn\u2019t Gone Off Yet \u2014 What To Know Institutional positioning likewise hints at fatigue. US regulatory filings show that large hedge funds trimmed spot-ETF holdings in the first quarter as the lucrative cash-and-carry spread compressed. Net inflows across the 11 US bitcoin ETFs have slowed to a trickle since late May, leaving cumulative additions at roughly $44 billion\u2014unchanged for almost a fortnight, according to Farside data. For now, the market\u2019s centre of gravity is exactly where QCP says it is: inside the $100,000\u2013$110,000 corridor. Volatility sellers continue to collect premium, and the risk-reward for momentum traders remains poor. Yet with CPI, PPI and high-stakes trade negotiations all landing inside a 72-hour window, the premium that option writers are harvesting could quickly look meagre. If the inflation data surprise to the upside, a repricing of Fed-cut expectations could turn last week\u2019s equity rally into a risk-off wobble, yanking bitcoin below six figures for the first time since April. Conversely, a benign print combined with even a symbolic easing of tariff rhetoric could flip the narrative to \u201csoft landing, structural bid via ETFs,\u201d reigniting topside optionality into the June quarter-end. In that scenario the rolled-out September $140,000 calls might come alive far sooner than their buyers now expect. Either way, the clock on bitcoin\u2019s summer doldrums is ticking loudly. \u201cWithout a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging,\u201d QCP warns. The narrative candidates arrive this week; whether they supply ignition or simply more noise will decide whether 2025\u2019s range trade breaks\u2014or cements itself as the dominant theme of another crypto summer.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-consolidates-as-momentum-builds-analyst-has-3k-in-sight-for-june/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has remained firm above key support levels despite the broader market pullback in recent weeks. While many altcoins have shown weakness, ETH continues to trade above the $2,400\u2013$2,500 zone, signaling strength and positioning itself for a potential recovery. After a volatile start to the year that saw steep declines, analysts are increasingly calling for a breakout, with some suggesting Ethereum could soon reclaim lost ground if current conditions hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages \u2013 Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? However, not everyone agrees on the bullish outlook. Some traders warn that Ethereum\u2019s recent consolidation may precede another leg down, especially if resistance near $2,800 remains unbroken. The debate highlights the uncertainty hanging over the market as macro risks and shifting liquidity continue to influence short-term direction. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared his view, noting that Ethereum is still consolidating after a strong May. While this pause may seem neutral, he pointed to rising ETF inflows and growing network activity as leading indicators of renewed demand. According to Pillows, these signals often precede price expansion, suggesting that ETH may just be gearing up for its next move. Ethereum Holds Firm As Market Volatility Builds Toward A Decisive Move Ethereum is navigating a critical moment as the broader crypto market faces heightened volatility and mounting uncertainty. Still trading 48% below its all-time high, ETH has shown impressive resilience, holding firm above key support levels even as sentiment wavers. The market remains on edge following renewed tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump \u2014 a dynamic that has triggered risk-off behavior and short-term instability across assets. Despite the noise, Ethereum continues to show underlying strength. Bitcoin remains stable near its highs, and many altcoins appear to be coiling for potential breakout moves. In this context, the coming weeks could prove decisive for ETH, which has so far managed to consolidate after a bullish May without breaking key structure. Ted Pillows noted in a recent update that Ethereum is still consolidating, and that\u2019s not necessarily bearish. According to his view, rising ETF inflows and accelerating network activity suggest that renewed demand is quietly building behind the scenes. Historically, these have been leading indicators of a breakout, and ETH looks well-positioned to take advantage. Momentum is shifting, and bulls are eyeing the $2,800 level as the next key threshold. Reclaiming that level could trigger a move toward $3,000 in June. Beyond that, if macro conditions remain stable, Ethereum could realistically push to $4,000 by Q3 2025. For now, ETH remains in consolidation mode \u2014 but with strength in the fundamentals, technical structure, and on-chain trends, the case for a breakout is growing stronger. The next move will be crucial, not just for Ethereum, but for the broader altcoin market heading into summer. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 \u2013 Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up ETH Holds Mid-Range Structure Amid Continued Consolidation Ethereum continues to trade within a tight range, holding at $2,513 after briefly dipping to $2,479 earlier in the session. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains in consolidation beneath the key resistance at $2,659, marked by the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which has capped several upside attempts throughout June. Despite failing to break out, the structure remains constructive. The 34-day EMA ($2,435.80) and 50-day SMA ($2,284.93) continue to act as dynamic support. ETH recently bounced off the 34 EMA after testing that level for three consecutive days, signaling buyers are still present and defending key zones. Meanwhile, volume remains muted, reflecting indecision and lack of conviction from both bulls and bears. For now, the $2,430\u2013$2,660 range defines the battleground. A daily close above the 200 SMA would indicate bullish continuation toward the $2,800 level. Conversely, a breakdown below $2,430 could trigger a larger retrace toward $2,200.

The next confirmed move out of this range will likely dictate the trend heading into late June. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Ethereum is back in sharp focus across the crypto market following a recent rally to $2,800 that has added fresh layers of bullish momentum to its long-term narrative. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trying to register a footing above $2,500, but this subdued price action masks what an analyst is calling one of the most critical technical and on-chain moments in Ethereum\u2019s recent history. Ethereum Weekly Engagement Hits Record High According to Crypto Patel, a crypto analyst on the social media platform X, Ethereum&#8217;s weekly engagement has reached an all-time high, surpassing all previous peaks seen since 2022. The accompanying chart below shows a steep rise in the number of unique addresses interacting with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Back In Business? Morningstar Candlestick Pattern Tells A Story According to the most recent data, the number of weekly active addresses stands at 17.4 million, representing an increase of almost 17% in just seven days. Notably, May 2025 saw the most significant growth in engagement, with each of the past three weeks witnessing at least 15 million active addresses. Meanwhile, the Layer 2 multiplier, which reflects adoption across Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions, has climbed to 7.55x, marking an 18.63% jump over the same period. Crypto Patel described the development as impossible to ignore, adding that the momentum is building fast, and warned followers to stay ready as Ethereum prepares for what could be a dramatic next leg up. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to ignore $ETH right now,\u201d he remarked. Despite a minor 4.31% decline in cross-chain activity in the past seven days, the overall engagement trend confirms that more users are entering the Ethereum ecosystem. Analyst Predicts $9,000 To $10,000 ETH Price Target Complementing this on-chain momentum is a broader technical perspective offered by another crypto analyst known as XForceGlobal on the social media platform X. In a detailed Elliott Wave analysis also shared on X, the analyst noted that Ethereum has successfully completed a complex corrective structure and is now poised to enter a powerful new impulsive phase. According to the chart, the bearish scenario has been invalidated by recent price behavior, and a new bullish cycle is now underway as Ethereum is currently playing out a bullish B wave. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH If this bullish B wave plays out as expected, XForceGlobal projects a major price surge with a target range between $9,000 and $10,000 for Ethereum. Specifically, the analyst identified a $9,410 price target for sometime in the next year. However, the analyst outlines a hypothetical fallback to the $576 zone if the C corrective wave unfolds. Nonetheless, the current wave structure shows an increased likelihood of Ethereum surging higher rather than breaking down. The analyst concluded by stating, \u201cWe can now confidently scrap the bearish case. The impulse opened the door for potential new highs.\u201d At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,493 with a recent intraday high of $2,537.

His average entry cost was less than $25,000. Still, he sees room to run even from around $106,000. Macro Concerns Drive Interest Based on reports, Deaton worries about soaring national debt in the US and fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office. He flags endless money printing by central banks as a red flag. I\u2019m not in favor of telling people living paycheck to paycheck (me until 15 years ago) to take out a mortgage on their primary home to buy Bitcoin (I\u2019m not suggesting that that\u2019s what David is recommending either), but I am in the process of selling real estate, and although my\u2026 https://t.co/JMB1zgeazW \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 8, 2025 He says all these moves are chipping away at trust in fiat cash. With only 21 million BTC ever to be mined, Bitcoin can\u2019t be inflated away. That fixed supply, he argues, makes it a solid hedge against a shaky dollar. Corporate And State Adoption Institutional demand is also on the rise. MicroStrategy\u2014now called Strategy\u2014holds more than 200,000 BTC, worth tens of billions of dollars. And in the last seven days, 16 companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. On the government side, Rep. Tim Burchett introduced a bill to turn a Trump executive order into law, creating a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries like Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are weighing similar steps. They want to see if holding Bitcoin could protect their foreign exchange plans. Skeptics Voice Worries Not everyone agrees with Deaton\u2019s rosy outlook. Economist Peter Schiff, a gold advocate, says Bitcoin has no real value and is too wild to be a safe haven. He tweeted that today\u2019s rally is just hype. Deaton doesn\u2019t shy away from such criticism. He admits he has \u201cconfirmation and wealth-preservation bias.\u201d He still insists Bitcoin is the best store of value during today\u2019s economic storms. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Deaton warns against buying with money you can\u2019t afford to lose.

His basic message is simple: look past daily price swings and ask where the world\u2019s money is headed.

This suggests that traders are still comfortable accumulating at current levels, and the market hasn&#8217;t yet reached a point of exhaustion. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains firmly in positive territory at 5835.33. The MACD&#8217;s positioning reflects steady buyer interest and a favorable trend structure, both of which are crucial for sustaining an upward move. Volume Slackens While Price Nears Critical Resistance Zone The analyst went on to point out that despite the bullish setup currently seen on Bitcoin\u2019s chart, the enthusiasm might be tempered by softening trading volume. Specifically, trading volume has only reached 95,302, significantly lower than the average volume of 179,421. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Again, Triggering Fresh Fears of a Deeper Correction This discrepancy signals a noticeable dip in market participation, raising the question of whether the ongoing price rally has enough fuel to sustain its momentum in the short term. As the analyst emphasized, this drop in volume is worth watching closely since it may influence the momentum of next week\u2019s price action. Looking at the broader picture, Bitcoin is approaching a major resistance level at $111,980. This key barrier represents a potential turning point; either it gets broken and paves the way for further upside, or it holds and prompts a short-term correction. Should a pullback occur, the analyst noted that BTC appears to have a comfortable support zone at $49,000, which could act as a solid cushion. In any case, the analyst suggests keeping a close eye on how these technical levels play out, as they could dictate Bitcoin\u2019s next big move.
