      "summary": "In a recent X post, CryptoWzrd highlighted that Litecoin (LTC) closed the day on a slightly bearish note. He explained that LTC\u2019s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin\u2019s movement and overall market sentiment, with the $96 level standing out as the next resistance. Bearish Daily Close For Litecoin Amid Bitcoin Correlation According to CryptoWzrd, Litecoin closed the day with a bearish daily candle, while mirroring Bitcoin&#8217;s price action. This alignment suggests that LTC remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and BTC\u2019s directional moves. Meanwhile, the LTCBTC pair ended the session indecisively, offering no clear signal of strength or weakness against Bitcoin at the moment. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance \u2013 Bulls Target $97.10 Level The analyst noted that for a sustained upside move in Litecoin, healthier and more constructive candles are needed on the LTCBTC chart. Without stronger signals from this pair, confidence in a breakout remains limited. Adding to the cautious tone, CryptoWzrd pointed out that a decline in Bitcoin dominance would be a critical factor in unlocking altcoin momentum, including for Litecoin. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is currently aiming for the $96 daily resistance level. CryptoWzrd explained that a successful push above this barrier could open the door for a stronger rally, potentially extending toward the $128 resistance zone. However, that scenario depends on supportive market conditions and renewed strength across altcoin charts. On the downside, $80 stands out as the key daily support level that traders should monitor. A breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction and delay any near-term bullish ambitions. Maintaining support above this level would be crucial in preserving the broader structure and keeping upward targets in play. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd emphasized his focus on the lower time frames to spot potential scalp opportunities. By analyzing intraday chart formations, he aims to capitalize on short-term price movements while the broader market context unfolds. Traders following LTC closely will want to keep an eye on these short-term setups for quick entries and exits amid ongoing volatility. Intraday Volatility Signals Patience Over Action In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that today\u2019s intraday chart for Litecoin was marked by volatility and a bearish tone, making it a challenging environment for clean trade setups. He emphasized the importance of waiting for a more favorable trading location before entering any positions, as the current conditions lacked clear direction and structure. Related Reading: Litecoin Could Be \u2018Just Weeks Away\u2019 From Third-Ever Golden Cross \u2014 Expert According to the analyst, a move above the $90 intraday resistance would be a positive signal and could present a potential long opportunity. However, if the price gets rejected at that level, it may lead to further downside pressure. For now, CryptoWzrd remains patient, waiting for the market to establish a healthier setup before taking action. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-will-surge-35000/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Ripple Pundit has boldly predicted that the XRP price can surge 35,000%. He alluded to two things that need to happen for the altcoin to reach this ambitious target. Factors That Will Make XRP Price Surge 35,000% In an X post, Ripple Pundit stated that the XRP price will jump by over 35,000% on the day that Ripple makes their banking license public. He added that the SEC announcement of dropping its appeal will also boost the altcoin further. Ripple has applied for a national banking license with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Related Reading: Can The XRP Price Rally 1,538x To Reach $3,380? Shocking Prediction This move is expected to expand the crypto firm\u2019s services, which is bullish for the XRP price, considering the altcoin\u2019s role in Ripple\u2019s payment solutions. As such, XRP is likely to record more adoption, especially from institutional investors, as the crypto firm onboard more clients through this banking license. Crypto pundit Vincent Van Code also agrees that a Ripple banking license could have a massive impact on the XRP price. He recently predicted that the altcoin could rally to between $30 and $50. It is also worth noting that Brad Garlinghouse declared his 1,000% commitment to XRP, which indicates that the altcoin remains a huge part of the company\u2019s plans. Meanwhile, as Ripple Pundit predicts, an SEC announcement of its decision to drop its appeal in the lawsuit against Ripple would also boost the XRP price. Ripple has already announced its decision to drop its cross-appeal. All that is remaining for the long-running legal battle to end is for the Commission to also drop its appeal. A conclusion of the lawsuit would finally remove the legal uncertainty that had plagued the altcoin for a long while. The Next Wave For XRP Starts Here In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades declared that the next wave for the XRP price starts from the $2.23 level. She claimed that the altcoin has continued to show strength during this consolidation. The analyst added that the Ripple bank charter application added serious momentum at just the right time. The news helped push XRP above the $2.25 resistance. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Is Moving According To Plan, Here\u2019s Why $1.90 Is Important Commenting on the current price action, CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is now seeing rejection at $2.268, which is the .382 retracement of the local wave. She remarked that this suggests that XRP needs another low before launching higher. The analyst said that based on the technical indicators, the next best entry is lining up at $2.235. She explained that this level is the .236 retracement and that multiple internal subwave targets are clustering there. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.22, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Popular market analyst and key opinion leader (KOL) Ted Pillows is projecting the crypto market to hit a $4.5 trillion valuation before Q3 2025 ends. This interestingly bullish forecast comes off the back of another Bitcoin price rejection allowing the total crypto market cap to maintain the choppy price movement seen in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop \u2013 Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend Rally Ahead? Crypto Market Tests $3.5T Barrier In an X post on July 4, Pillows shares an insightful technical analysis on the total crypto market cap. Using the daily CryptoCap chart from Tradingview, the renowned analyst highlights the recent formation of a bull flag hinting at an impending price breakout. For context, the bull flag is a classic bullish continuation pattern. It starts with the formation of a flagpole i.e. a strong upward price movement, as seen between early April to late May when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. This structure is followed by the \u201cflag,\u201d i.e., a descending price channel that reflects a period of consolidation. This market action is seen from late May to the present, as the crypto market cap entered a temporary pullback phase. Pillows\u2019 analysis shows a complete bull flag formation. However, the crypto market cap must achieve a decisive price close above the $3.5 trillion mark which represents the upper boundary of the flag to confirm a price breakout. If this bullish scenario occurs, Ted Pillows predicts the crypto total market cap to surge to around $4.3 trillion &#8211; $4.5 trillion in Q3 2025. Considering its market dominance levels of 62.77%, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap could also rise to around $2.82 trillion in such bullish conditions providing a market price of $141,800 per unit. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the occurrence of an altseason amidst this crypto price surge could alter the projected market status for the premier cryptocurrency.

However, the ongoing crypto bull run has delivered an impressive 51.24% gain over the past year. The market leader, Bitcoin, is presently valued at $108,118 reflecting a 1.46% loss in the last 24 hours as previously stated.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-stuck-at-2500/",
      "summary": "The Ethereum price is currently locked in a narrow trading range of around $2,500, with momentum stalling despite the market&#8217;s bullish expectations. In light of this, a leading crypto analyst warns that current price action lacks the strength needed for a powerful upward move, urging traders to remain cautious. The analyst notes that without a clear breakout signal, entering the market now could expose investors to potential downside risks. $2,800 Breakout Key For Ethereum Price Bull Rally A new analysis released on the X social media platform by market expert Daan Crypto Trades reveals that the Ethereum price has continued to trade within a well-defined price channel, currently holding above the $2,500 level at $2,527. The analyst emphasized that $2,800 remains the key breakout point that could trigger an Ethereum bull rally. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here\u2019s Why The market expert shared a chart highlighting that ETH remains confined between a \u201crange low\u201d of $2,313 and a high of $2,736, with multiple failed attempts to break out of this tight structure. The chart also shows that the mid-range level of around $2,519 has become a critical point of control. Despite a brief rally that pushed the Ethereum price above $2,570 earlier this week, the cryptocurrency was still unable to sustain the upward move, slipping back below the $2,519 level before recovering to its current price of around $2,527. Daan Crypto Trades explains that the reason for Ethereum\u2019s sluggish performance is its continued struggle to establish a solid footing in the $2,500 price region. Given the clear price imbalance in this zone, the analyst advises traders to exercise caution before entering the market. Within this range, traders may encounter increased price volatility and potential fakeouts, both above and below the key support and resistance levels. Given the unstable market environment, Daan Crypto Trades suggests that until Ethereum breaks and holds above the $2,800 mark, traders are likely to face more sideways action and unpredictable price swings. A clean breakout above $2,800 could be the key to the start of a bullish trend, improving conditions for ETH and pushing it out of its present downtrend. ETH Four-Year Consolidation Sees An End Market expert Mister Crypto has also shared insights on the current Ethereum price action. The analyst declared in a recent X post that ETH is on the verge of exiting a prolonged multi-year consolidation phase. His chart, which visualizes the cryptocurrency\u2019s historical price movements, marks two key periods\u2014a powerful 48x rally from 2018 through 2021, followed by a four-year horizontal consolidation range that spans from the 2021 top to the present day. Related Reading: The Ethereum Waiting Game: Breakout To $2,800 Or Crash To $2,000? The analysis suggests that this extended period of range-bound movement could be a prelude to a potentially explosive bull trend, similar to the breakout seen in the past. In line with this, Mister Crypto marks a large open-ended \u201c??X\u201d label on his chart, suggesting the next breakout phase is imminent\u2014though the precise magnitude is left speculative.
