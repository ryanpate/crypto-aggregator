      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dominance-shows-bearish-divergence-altseason-could-be-near/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin briefly pushed into the $108,800 level a few hours ago but was once again unable to reclaim higher prices, reinforcing the key resistance just below its all-time high. This rejection has left the market in a state of caution, with investors expecting increased volatility in the coming sessions. As BTC continues to hover below the $109,300 mark, traders are watching closely for signs of either a confirmed breakout or a potential pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles Below ATH After Weeks Of Failed Attempts \u2013 $109K Level In Focus Adding a new layer to the current setup, top analyst Ted Pillows shared a notable development in Bitcoin dominance. According to Pillows, the Bitcoin Dominance chart is now showing a daily bearish divergence\u2014a classic signal that often precedes a shift in momentum from Bitcoin to altcoins. This divergence occurs when BTC dominance trends higher while momentum indicators begin to weaken, suggesting that Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength may be peaking. For altcoin investors, this could be an early signal of a shift. Historically, bearish divergences in dominance have lead to strong altcoin rallies, as capital begins flowing from BTC into higher-beta assets. While Bitcoin consolidates near resistance, attention may soon shift toward altcoins, setting the stage for a possible altseason. Bitcoin Consolidates As Charts Signal Altcoin Rotation Following the resolution of global tensions between the US, Israel, and Iran, Bitcoin surged above the $105,000 level, signaling renewed confidence across global risk markets. The move marked a key recovery from previous uncertainty, with BTC taking back critical support and shifting focus back toward the $110,000 resistance zone. However, despite the initial breakout, Bitcoin has struggled to push into uncharted territory. Price action remains choppy and directionless, with the market hesitating ahead of what many believe could be a decisive move. Analysts continue to call for a breakout, citing strong accumulation trends, improving macroeconomic conditions, and a bullish long-term structure. Yet the inability to break above the $109,300\u2013$110,000 range raises concerns about weakening momentum. The longer Bitcoin remains capped below resistance, the more likely it is that capital may begin to rotate into other parts of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared key insights supporting that thesis. According to Pillows, Bitcoin dominance is showing a daily bearish divergence\u2014a classic sign of impending trend reversal. As BTC dominance climbs but momentum weakens, it suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s recent strength may be fading, and a shift toward altcoins could be underway. Historically, bearish divergences in BTC dominance have often preceded sharp corrections in Bitcoin and explosive rallies across the altcoin market. As Bitcoin consolidates and its dominance loses strength, conditions may be forming for the next big altseason. While nothing is guaranteed, the combination of geopolitical relief, market indecision, and technical signals suggests that a sharp rotation could be close. Traders are now watching both BTC price and dominance levels closely, knowing that once momentum shifts, the move could be swift and powerful. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $269M In Net Inflows In 24H \u2013 Bullish Momentum Accelerates ETH/BTC Chart Shows Signs Of Reversal The ETH/BTC weekly chart reveals a prolonged downtrend that has persisted since late 2022, with Ethereum consistently underperforming against Bitcoin. Since peaking above 0.085 BTC in late 2022, the pair has steadily declined, now trading around 0.0228 BTC\u2014a level not seen since 2020. This confirms that Bitcoin has been the clear market leader for nearly two years, adding most of the capital inflow during bullish phases while altcoins, including Ethereum, lagged behind. However, current price action shows early signs that this trend may be nearing its end. ETH/BTC appears to have found a local bottom, just above the 0.02 BTC zone, after a steep drop. Although the pair remains well below the 50 (weekly), 100, and 200 moving averages, the selling momentum has clearly slowed, and volume has begun to stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel \u2013 Next Move Could Be Parabolic This phase suggests that a swing could be forming. If Ethereum can reclaim higher support levels and Bitcoin dominance continues to show bearish divergence\u2014as noted in recent market analyses\u2014the ETH/BTC ratio could start trending higher once again. A rotation from Bitcoin into Ethereum and other altcoins may soon follow, potentially marking the beginning of a new phase in the crypto cycle where altcoins start to outperform.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-145000-in-september/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards has provided an update on the current Bitcoin price action, predicting that the flagship crypto could reach as high $145,000 later this year. The analyst alluded to a doji pattern, which supports this bullish prediction. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally To $145,000 In an X post, Stockmoney Lizards stated that his mid-term target for the Bitcoin price is between $135,000 and $145,000. He expects BTC to reach these targets between September and October later this year. The analyst also touched on the current price action and why he believes the flagship crypto will reach such lofty heights. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place Stockmoney noted that the Bitcoin price is trading at the upper level of the corrective channel, forming some dojis at this level. He admitted that he doesn\u2019t know how many bounces market participants will see from BTC and what levels the crypto will test. He raised the possibility that the local bottom may be in and also that BTC could retest the $90,000 to $94,000 range. The analyst stated that if he had to bet, he would probably predict that the Bitcoin price taps the high of the $90,000 range again. BTC had dropped to as low as $98,000 last week amid the escalated tensions between Israel and Iran. Bitcoin has since recovered following the ceasefire between both countries. Stockmoney affirmed that the latest Bitcoin price action is a bullish formation as the flagship crypto has had an impulsive move up. He added that the current price action is not the usual money rotation with old traders selling and new traders loading up at range lows. The analyst also indicated that BTC\u2019s rally isn\u2019t driven by the derivatives market either. BTC To At Least Reach $135,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has echoed Stockmoney\u2019s prediction that the Bitcoin price could at least reach $135,000. In an X post, the analyst declared that BTC\u2019s path to this price target remains intact. He stated that Bitcoin is now challenging the first Fibonacci extension at $107,000 after breaking out and retesting key levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Once the Bitcoin price clears this Fibonacci extension, Titan of Crypto believes that the next stop is $135,000.

His accompanying chart showed that BTC could reach this Fibonacci extension at $135,000 by September, aligning with Stockmoney\u2019s prediction. The chart also suggested that BTC could still rally to as high as $150,000 at some point. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,200, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-after-2-07-fib-zone-test/",
      "summary": "XRP showed a powerful technical reaction after dipping precisely to the $2.07 Fib confluence zone, where multiple key levels aligned \u2014 including the golden .618 Fib retracement and wave-based extensions. The sharp bounce from this area signals a potential end to the recent correction and opens the door for further upside. The Perfect Bounce: XRP Finds Bottom At $2.07 Confluence CasiTrades, in a latest post on X, stated that on Friday, XRP dipped precisely to the $2.07 confluence zone, aligning with the golden .618 retracement, the 1:1 extension for wave C, and the .618 extension for subwave 5. She noted that a sharp reaction from that level would confirm the correction bottom, and the market did exactly that, snapping upward from the $2.07 mark. Related Reading: XRP Price Springs Higher \u2014 Rally Reignited with Bullish Momentum Since then, momentum has steadily increased, with bullish pressure building over time. Price action is now pressing into a critical resistance zone at $2.25, a level that represents the macro .382 Fibonacci retracement and has served as a significant technical barrier for months. Breaking and holding above this level could signal a shift from recovery to full-blown bullish continuation. Adding to the momentum, Ripple dropped its appeal, and the US SEC\u2019s withdrawal could be the next trigger to price spikes. According to CasiTrades, the legal finish line is finally in sight, just as the price completes its correction structure, a timing she believes is no coincidence. This, she emphasized, is why technical analysis matters: it allows traders to identify key setups before the news breaks, positioning ahead of market-moving headlines. Key Short-Term Scenarios To Watch The analyst further explained that from this point, she is closely watching two key short-term scenarios unfold. In the first scenario, XRP makes a move up to around $2.30, followed by a pullback to retest $2.25 \u2014 this time as support, which CasiTrades considers an ideal and healthy move. Related Reading: XRP Silent Accumulation: A Falling Wedge On The Verge Of Explosion The second scenario involves a stronger push straight through to the $2.45 zone, heading toward the larger resistance near $2.69. In this case, a minor pullback would likely occur just before the price interacts with the $2.69 resistance area. After that, the analyst anticipates a backtest of the $2.25 level. Either way, she emphasized that $2.25 remains the critical level to watch. Successfully flipping it sets the stage for a much larger breakout move. CasiTrades added that Friday\u2019s bounce wasn\u2019t just a random spike; it was a precise reaction to a completed structure. With wave 2 down, wave 3 is officially underway, and once these nearby resistance levels are cleared, it could all lead to a surge. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/south-korea-cbdc-delay-best-wallet-edge/",
      "summary": "South Korea pressed pause on its central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, even as its new government pivoted toward promoting domestic stablecoins. Telling banks involved that introducing won-denominated stablecoins would be \u2018desirable,\u2019 South Korea&#8217;s central bank has slowed down on any progress towards a CBDC. In the meantime, Hong Kong is rolling out a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance aimed at challenging U.S. dollar dominance and bolstering its own financial infrastructure. Both countries reinforce a common perception: crypto is here to stay, and you\u2019ll need a top-notch crypto wallet like Best Wallet app to keep on top of everything. South Korea: Cold Feet on CBDC, but Full Speed Ahead on Stablecoins In a surprise move, the Bank of Korea halted the second phase of its CBDC pilot, planned for later this year, for further review. The advanced pilot, involving peer-to-peer transfers and merchant payments, takes a back seat amid rising concern over cost, commercialization ambiguity, and regulatory readiness. This policy change is strongly influenced by President Lee Jae\u2011myung\u2019s administration, which won elections earlier in June based at least partly on crypto promises. The new administration also fostered a regulatory framework enabling firms with modest capital (\u20a9500 million ~ US$370K) to issue stablecoins under the Digital Asset Basic Act. At a time when over a third of South Korea\u2019s population \u2013 roughly 18M people \u2013 trade crypto, boosting stablecoins seems like a solid move. The decision to move away from a CBDC is a bit more surprising. Still, with so many investors trading crypto daily, there\u2019s a real desire to build and strengthen frameworks like the ones for stablecoins. Other countries are making similar moves, though perhaps for more political reasons. Hong Kong: Regulating Stablecoins to Reduce U.S. Dollar Dependence Hong Kong is set to enforce its Stablecoins Ordinance starting August 1, 2025. Passed on May 21, the law mandates HKMA licensing for any fiat-referenced stablecoin issuer targeting the city\u2019s residents. The rigorous licensing requirements cover reserve holdings, fund segregation, redemption rights, and anti-money-laundering protocols. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan ties the initiative to China\u2019s broader de\u2011dollarization strategy, highlighting stablecoins as pivotal for trade and cross-border payments in local currencies. In his words: \u2018Fintech has great potential in the application of cross-border trade, and the goal is to solve the long-standing pain points of slow and high cost of cross-border payment, and better serve the real economy in the field of payment\u2026 stablecoins are a cost-effective alternative to the traditional financial system and have the potential to revolutionize payments and capital market activities, including cross-border payments. The stablecoin legislation will\u2026 encourage issuers to extend the application of stablecoins to different scenarios, and help solve the real pain points of enterprises in business and people&#8217;s lives.\u2019 Hong Kong anticipates local issuers and regulated institutions taking the lead, with limited retail uptake initially, but significant promise for cross-border institutional use. And as retail interest grows, more and more investors are going to need a crypto wallet \u2013 the best kind of crypto wallet. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 Supercharge the Leading Web3 Wallet for the World Crypto Economy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) takes two key ingredients for crypto wallet utility and creates something even more powerful. The first element is a simple, powerful web3 wallet \u2013 Best Wallet app. With MPC and biometric security, the ability to set up multiple wallets, and a unique upcoming tokens hub to research and purchase hot crypto presales, Best Wallet app gives new and experienced crypto users everything they need to succeed in today\u2019s crypto economy. The $BEST token supercharges the entire ecosystem.

What These Moves Signal Both governments seek to balance private stablecoin innovation with preserving monetary policy control. South Korea\u2019s pivot reflects a pragmatic approach: redirecting momentum from costly and uncertain CBDC deployment toward a more agile, regulated stablecoin model. Hong Kong\u2019s strategy signifies a calculated expansion of its role in the global digital asset economy, linking stablecoin issuance to monetary liberalization and regional trade objectives, and supporting China\u2019s broader political goals. In each case, the success of stablecoin ambitions hinges on the dirty details of regulation, institutional participation, and financial market dynamics. And success means that everyone, not just major institutions, will want their own Web3 wallet. As always, do your own research \u2013 this isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-forms-bullish-flag-on-daily-chart-breakout-imminent/",
      "summary": "Solana is displaying signs of strength as it trades with a key chart pattern, which indicates that the altcoin is preparing for a solid move. The price has been holding steady, forming lower highs and higher lows within a narrowing range. This pause in momentum could be setting the stage for another breakout. Key Resistance Levels In Focus As Breakout Approaches Solana has developed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, signaling a continuation of its uptrend. According to Dynamite Trader&#8217;s post on X, this pattern often precedes strong breakouts, suggesting that momentum could soon accelerate. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breakout Watch: Price Could Rally Hard Above $150 Level? Currently, SOL&#8217;s price is holding above the midline of the flag, indicating underlying strength. However, it&#8217;s also testing the daily 100 moving average (MA100), which is acting as a dynamic resistance. SOL&#8217;s reaction to this level will be crucial in determining whether the bullish flag leads to a decisive breakout or a deeper consolidation. Another analyst, Henry, highlighted that Solana is gearing up for a big move after completing a clean Cup and Handle breakout on the 4-hour chart, a bullish pattern that signals continuation. The breakout saw SOL flip the $149 resistance into support, a key technical shift. If this level holds, Henry sees a rally toward the $168 to $174 zone, which aligns with previous resistance levels and bullish extension targets. He adds a warning that volatility is increasing, and high-leverage positions are at risk on both sides. Solana is setting up a clean wedge on the weekly chart. Currently trading at $150, SOL has been consistently bouncing between support and resistance levels, which is known for building pressure before delivering sharp moves. Talking about this, Top G emphasizes that if this plays out as expected, the next leg up could be significant, and $300 isn&#8217;t just speculation; it&#8217;s a realistic target based on the structure and behavior. Holding Above The Breakout Zone Could Accelerate The Move Upward Solana has broken above the downtrend line on the 4-hour chart. This move could mark a pivotal shift in short-term momentum, with potential bullish continuation if current levels hold. Related Reading: Solana Price At \u2018A Very Delicate Level\u2019 \u2013 Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key If SOL maintains its position above this trend line, crypto analyst Bens BTC noted that the price could climb toward the next resistance area at $165. The price action is forming a bullish structure, and momentum indicators may soon align with the breakout, further supporting the continuation of the upside. The asset had broken out with strong momentum and is now trading firmly within a long-term bullish channel, a structure that has supported uptrends. The price action looks clean, with higher highs and higher lows forming as SOL surges upward. Furthermore, analyst Persis10t revealed that momentum is picking up, and as long as the channel remains intact, the path forward could be explosive. If the structure holds and attracts volume, Persis10t projects a target of $700+ in the next run, pointing to the upper boundary of the bullish channel as a magnet for price.
