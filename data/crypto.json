      "summary": "Bitwise Asset Management has quietly nudged Dogecoin one step closer to Wall Street\u2019s ETF club, filing an amended S-1 on 26 June that for the first time allows \u201cin-kind\u201d creations and redemptions. The tweak is more than procedural. It lines the proposed Bitwise Dogecoin ETF up with the operational playbook the US Securities and Exchange Commission already blessed for spot-bitcoin and spot-ether products, and it signals that SEC staff are now deep in the weeds on the mechanics of custody and settlement. Signs Point To Dogecoin ETF Approval \u201cBitwise has filed amended S-1s for their spot Dogecoin ETF and their spot Aptos ETFs. Good signs as it indicates SEC engagement, and tracks with other spot approvals,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X. He underscored the importance of the new language: \u201cOne HUGE update to the filing is \u2018in-kind\u2019 creations and redemptions\u2026 Near-lock at this point that in-kind will be allowed in spot ETFs across board.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal\u2014But One Move Could Ruin It The change matters because in-kind processing lets authorized participants swap DOGE directly for ETF shares (and vice versa) without the tax friction and slippage that accompany the cash-only model imposed on futures-based crypto funds. The SEC\u2019s willingness to consider that structure for a dog-branded altcoin would have seemed fanciful a year ago. It now appears consistent with the regulator\u2019s post-bitcoin-ETF d\u00e9tente, during which issuers also sought in-kind redemptions. Approval odds are converging on the high end of the spectrum. Less than a week ago, Balchunas and fellow analyst James Seyffart raised their probability for \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of pending altcoin ETFs\u2014including Dogecoin\u2014to \u201c90 percent or higher,\u201d citing what Seyffart called \u201cvery positive\u201d SEC engagement.

      "summary": "Bitcoin traders everywhere will be watching their feeds closely, willing the world\u2019s largest crypto to hold steady at or near its current $107K mark. $15B in Bitcoin options expire today, a major portion of the roughly $40B in options outstanding. If $BTC\u2019s price falls to $102K or below, the market would endure a true \u2018pain point.\u2019 As long as that doesn\u2019t happen, Bitcoin looks set to press on with business as normal \u2013 setting the stage for further growth of the ecosystem and the first meme coin offering direct $BTC exposure, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Narrowing Volatility Indicates Positive Outlook The $BTC volatility index has narrowed in recent days, drawing more closely to the historical volatility and generally indicating that traders don\u2019t expect dramatic price moves either way \u2013 up or down. That was supported by Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David P\u00e9quignot, who stated: \u2018Low open interest in perps and fairly depressed Bitcoin implied volatility and skew are indicative of limited expectations for sharp price movements\u2026\u2019 Where does that leave Bitcoin? Still looking bullish. Crypto treasury strategies are still expanding, adding thousands of $BTC tokens to long-term reserves and increasing demand. Metaplanet just added 1,234 $BTC, bringing its total portfolio north of 12K $BTC. And it isn\u2019t just direct Bitcoin purchases; the ecosystem around the world\u2019s leading crypto continues to fuel demand. ETFs Notch 13 Days Consecutive Inflows, Bitcoin Overtakes Google Bitcoin ETFs are building on a 13-day stretch of positive inflows. Monday to Thursday, daily cumulative inflows amounted to: $350M $588M $547M $226M Positive inflows point to long-term interest from retail and institutional investors, rather than short-term traders, and contribute to underlying buying pressure. And with the largest Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, holding over $70B in total assets, Bitcoin took advantage of weakening Alphabet stock to overthrow Google as the world\u2019s sixth-largest asset. It\u2019s a combination of fundamentally positive factors, reinforcing a bullish case for $BTC \u2013 and the meme coin built on that case. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Meme Coin Trusting $BTC to Hit $250K and Beyond BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is confident that Bitcoin will one day reach $250K and more \u2013 so confident that the project is built around key Bitcoin price milestones. Bitcoin $125K: The project burns $BTCBULL tokens to exert deflationary pressure on the price. Bitcoin $150K: BTC Bull token investors who hold their tokens in the Best Wallet app receive a free $BTC airdrop. Bitcoin $175K: Another $BTCBULL token burn. Bitcoin $200K: Another $BTC airdrop! Bitcoin $225K: A final $BTCBULL burn. Bitcoin $250K: A massive $BTCBULL airdrop. The combination of token burns and airdrops encourages positive momentum for BTC Bull Token, following Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory. The presale has raised $7.5M so far. Only three days remain in the presale, so act now \u2013 you can learn how to buy BTC Bull token in our guide. Tokens currently cost $0.00258, but our analysts expect the price to hit $0.0084 by year-end. Visit the BTC Bull token website today. BTC Options Expire, But Outlook Is Bullish for Bitcoin With $15B in Bitcoin options expiring, narrowing volatility, and consistent ETF inflows, Bitcoin\u2019s foundation looks stronger than ever. For investors looking to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, BTC Bull Token offers a bold, milestone-based roadmap aligned with $BTC\u2019s rise to $250K. But be warned \u2013 there\u2019s mere days left in the presale, so the window to join is closing fast. Always do your own research. This is not financial advice."

Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy added 245 BTC after spending $1 billion the week before. Smarter Web picked up 197 BTC, while M\u00e9liuz S.A. acquired 275 BTC, taking its total to 596 BTC.

Yet markets may remain unpredictable. Unexpected sell-offs or macro shocks can turn the trend around quicker than anyone can imagine. Investors and analysts will be monitoring the pace of new entrants into the market.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/top-analyst-new-bitcoin-peak-timeline-double-cycle-blowoff/",
      "summary": "Veteran crypto analyst Bob Loukas has delivered a Bitcoin update suggesting that the asset could be entering the \u201cperfect storm\u201d phase of its four-year cycle. But in a twist that defies traditional cycle models, Loukas now sees the possibility of a delayed blowoff top extending into early 2026 and introduces the prospect of a rare double-cycle structure. In his latest installment of the Four-Year Journey published on June 26, Loukas reaffirms that the current Bitcoin cycle \u2014 which began with the November 2022 low \u2014 remains structurally intact and is nearing its climactic phase. &#8220;This is certainly the most bullish phase of the four-year cycle,&#8221; Loukas states. &#8220;We&#8217;re now sort of on the cusp of what traditionally has been the beginning or the blowoff phase of a cycle.&#8221; Bitcoin Blowoff Delayed? What separates this cycle, according to Loukas, is the unique combination of maturing fundamentals and a confluence of macro, institutional, and regulatory forces. These include continued ETF inflows, corporate treasury adoption, and a radical policy shift under the Trump administration, including what he anticipates may be a pro-crypto Fed chair appointment. Together, these forces are creating what he calls a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for price expansion. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Loukas is cautious about providing hard price targets but acknowledges a doubling effect that could send Bitcoin from its current range near $110,000 to as high as $150,000\u2013$170,000 in the short term. Historically, such phases have seen Bitcoin double in a matter of months once new highs are breached. \u201cA breakout to the upside can see Bitcoin essentially almost double in a very short period of time,\u201d he says, pointing to prior legs of the cycle where Bitcoin surged from $25K to $75K or $50K to $100K within five-month windows. Yet what makes this latest report particularly notable is Loukas&#8217; introduction of a more complex structure he calls a \u201cdouble cycle blowoff.\u201d He describes this as a fusion of two adjacent four-year cycle peaks \u2014 a concept that could delay the market top to as late as February or March 2026, well beyond the traditional 35-month cycle peak window. &#8220;If we&#8217;ve still got sort of a six to seven month expansion to a peak\u2026 that would lead us into maybe even a February or March peak,\u201d Loukas explains. This scenario, while still within the broader cyclical rhythm, would imply a 39\u201341 month uptrend rather than the typical 33\u201335 months. \u201cI do think it\u2019s time\u2026 15\u201316 years into Bitcoin\u2019s adoption,\u201d he notes, referencing the arc from early tech believers to deep institutional penetration. Related Reading: $179,000 Or $79,000? Bitcoin Faces Critical Cycle Pivot, Says Analyst The implications are significant. A delayed peak could mean a much shorter corrective phase \u2014 or even the emergence of a second explosive rally as the next cycle begins, creating what Loukas describes as the illusion of one extended supercycle. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant upside potential still to come in this cycle,\u201d he says, warning that many may be caught off guard. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be surprised.\u201d BTC Price Targets Loukas also addresses the broader sentiment picture, noting that the typical mania \u2014 the kind that marked tops in 2017 and late 2021 \u2014 has not yet materialized. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that sort of blowoff, absolute extreme sentiment that you typically would see near the top,\u201d he says. He sees this as further evidence that the final phase is still ahead. Regarding the price target for a supercycle, Loukas ponders: \u201cI can see numbers in the quarter of a million level. I can also see some really crazy numbers when you see prior manias and bubbles in different asset classes, [&#8230;] Seeing a 5x, 6x, 7x move from here over a 2-year period in a major mania is not really a stretch. Even from a market cap perspective, it&#8217;s not a stretch, seeing where gold is already heading through the $20 trillion level and well beyond.\u201d While he emphasizes that these ideas are probabilistic and not predictions, Loukas does warn of the long-term consequences if his double-cycle thesis plays out. A massive influx of institutional capital, sovereign interest, and retail mania could ultimately trigger Bitcoin\u2019s first true secular bear market, one not measured in months but in years. \u201cIf you consider a mania leadup where so many treasury companies and traditional flows come together and peak\u2026 the unwinding process just takes a lot longer.\u201d For now, Loukas\u2019 model portfolio remains partially in cash after trimming some positions near recent highs, reflecting a conservative approach tailored to capital preservation. Still, he acknowledges that younger or more risk-tolerant investors may view this moment as a final accumulation window before the next phase begins. \u201cThis video is very, very bullish, right?\u201d he quips.

      "summary": "The XRP price experienced a significant decline on Thursday following new developments in the ongoing legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; decision to deny the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling halted the XRP price recovery as it aimed to breach the nearest resistance level at $2.23. Key Issues Unresolved For Ripple Despite the SEC dropping its appeal, which indicated that the primary legal conflict between the two parties may be reaching a conclusion, Judge Torres&#8217; ruling highlighted that several procedural matters still require resolution, including necessary court approvals. In her judgment, she made it clear that private agreements cannot supersede public court decisions, stating, \u201cThe parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court\u2019s final judgment\u2026 They have not come close to doing so here.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move \u2014 Chart Signals Are Clear In response to the ruling, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to convey that the situation is now back in Ripple&#8217;s hands. The executive pointed out that the court has given them two options: either to dismiss their appeal regarding the historic institutional sales or to continue with the appeal. Regardless of the path chosen, Alderoty emphasized that XRP&#8217;s legal status as a non-security remains intact, reassuring stakeholders that it is business as usual. Expert Reactions To Torres\u2019 Decision Legal expert Fred Rispoli also weighed in on the implications of the injunction, stating that it would not impact XRP in secondary markets or affect potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings awaiting approval by the SEC. He noted that the injunction is merely a court document and emphasized the low likelihood of Judge Torres calling Ripple and the SEC back into court unless the SEC believes Ripple is violating the terms of the injunction. Rispoli further questioned whether the SEC has the authority to grant Ripple the necessary exemptions to alleviate any restrictions imposed by the injunction, suggesting that such actions fall within the SEC&#8217;s executive powers. Ripple has asserted that it has adjusted its operations to align with the court&#8217;s findings, particularly regarding its past sales to institutional investors. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Alderoty&#8217;s use of the term &#8220;historic institutional sales&#8221; in his recent statement indicates a shift in how both parties might approach future transactions, signaling a potential settlement that would allow XRP sales to institutions in a manner acceptable to the SEC. XRP Price Could Reach $5 Despite this temporary setback, market analysts remain optimistic about XRP&#8217;s future. Crypto analyst CryptoBullet recently noted that XRP&#8217;s two-week price chart resembles patterns seen in 2017, including a significant accumulation phase and a potential breakout. With this historical context in mind, the expert predicts a final surge in the XRP price, forecasting new all-time high targets between $4.50 and $5.40 for the cryptocurrency. As of press time, the XRP price has retreated to the $2.08 mark, which is a key support level for bulls anticipating further recovery of the token. In the last 24 hours, XRP has dropped 4.4%, and 10% in the last month. According to CoinGecko data, the XRP price remains 38% below its record high of $3.40.
