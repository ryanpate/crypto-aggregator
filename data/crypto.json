      "summary": "Bitcoin has resumed its upward movement, maintaining strength above the $107,000 level as market momentum builds toward the asset\u2019s recent all-time high above $111,000. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,242, reflecting a 1.3% gain over the past 24 hours and a 2.7% rise in the past week. The market\u2019s rebound comes after a brief dip last weekend, suggesting that investor confidence remains resilient heading into the next potential leg up. Contributing to the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant analyst \u0130brahim CO\u015eAR recently highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s successful reclaim of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which he described as a key level to track for short-term price trends. Related Reading: Fast-Tracking A Bitcoin Rally: Expert Identifies 3 Bullish Catalysts Bitcoin Reclaims Key Technical Level, Eyes $120K Potential According to CO\u015eAR, the 50-day EMA often acts as dynamic support during corrections, and regaining this level typically precedes a price rally. In past cycles, similar conditions have led to gains between 10% to 20% shortly after the level was reclaimed. CO\u015eAR further noted that Bitcoin\u2019s reclaim of the 50-day EMA occurred after a short-lived breakdown, which was quickly reversed with three consecutive daily closes above the level. This technical setup mirrors previous instances that preceded substantial upward moves. CO\u015eAR also cautioned that while the technical structure favors continued gains, geopolitical uncertainties, especially involving the US, Israel, and Iran, could introduce sudden volatility. As a result, he advised market participants to avoid leveraged positions in the short term and remain prepared for potential price swings. CO\u015eAR wrote: That said, geopolitical developments\u2014particularly any positive or negative news involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran\u2014could trigger sudden volatility in BTC\u2019s price. Please avoid using leverage during this period and remain cautious in the face of potential market swings. Further Into Technicals: Analyst Points to Bullish Flag Adding to the conversation, independent crypto analyst Captain Faibik suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s price pattern is forming a bullish flag, a common continuation pattern in technical analysis. According to Faibik, while the structure indicates a likely breakout, a final corrective dip to the $97,000\u2013$98,000 range may occur before upward momentum resumes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall He emphasized that a confirmed breakout above the $108,000 resistance would be a key signal, potentially setting the stage for a mid-term target of $130,000. $BTC is currently forming Bullish flag Pattern, but there\u2019s a chance we could see one more correction before the massive Bullish Rally begins..

      "summary": "Following a quick drop to nearly $98,000 over the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered most of its recent losses and is now trading above $107,000 at the time of writing. Fresh on-chain data suggests that the short-term holder (STH) floor for BTC has been steadily rising toward the $100,000 level. Bitcoin STH Floor Approaching $100,000 According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor unchained, Bitcoin\u2019s STH Realized Price has been making its slow grind up toward the psychologically important $100,000 level. Notably, the analyst had earlier dubbed this metric as the \u201cfault line\u201d to watch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the STH Realized Price represents the average price at which all Bitcoin held for less than 155 days was acquired. It acts as both a key psychological and technical support level. When the market price stays above it, STH are in profit and more confident, whereas if it falls below, fear and selling pressure often increase. Currently, the STH Realized Price hovers around $98,000. The analyst notes that each $500 rise in the STH Realized Price effectively resets the \u201cnew buyers\u2019 comfort floor.\u201d As this metric nears six figures, the mental stop-loss for newer investors also moves upward. The following chart illustrates two recent instances where BTC bounced sharply after touching the blue STH Realized Price line. This price action suggests a bullish structure, where selling pressure diminishes as soon as BTC revisits its average cost basis. Meanwhile, the premium &#8211; the difference between BTC\u2019s spot price and STH Realized Price &#8211; currently hovers around 7.2%. A shrinking premium, typically under 10%, has historically signalled reduced market froth and often preceded the next leg up once open interest began to rebuild. On the long-term side, the long-term holder (LTH) Realized Price remains largely unchanged at $32,000, roughly one-third of the STH Realized Price. The analyst observes that these long-term coins are likely held in cold storage, indicating \u201cstrong hands\u201d with little incentive to sell. They concluded: The blue line is climbing relentlessly; as long as BTC lives above it, the prevailing tide is still higher-lows, higher-highs. Lose it on a daily close, and we get our first real gut-check since April &#8211; otherwise the bull engine is merely cooling its cylinders. Experts Predict New High For BTC As BTC\u2019s STH Realized Price continues to surge higher &#8211; resulting in a higher floor price for the digital asset &#8211; several crypto experts seem to agree that the cryptocurrency may soon reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months.
