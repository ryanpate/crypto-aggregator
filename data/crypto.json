      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of repeating a historic Golden Cross pattern that led to a long-term parabolic run. While the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent pullback near the $100,000 region may have alarmed the crypto market, analysts suggest that this move is part of a broader trend that could push BTC to its next price high. Golden Cross Formation Pits Bitcoin At $150,000 Bitcoin has once again flashed a classic bullish signal, the Golden Cross, prompting renewed optimism for a major price rally in the coming months. According to a technical analysis by \u2018Chain Mind,\u2019 a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Bitcoin may be on the verge of an explosive surge to $150,000 if this historical pattern plays out as expected.

      "summary": "According to social media buzz, the growing clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump has sent ripples through the crypto world. Musk\u2019s public swipe at a recent spending bill kicked things off. Then came Trump\u2019s warning to yank Musk\u2019s government contracts. It got messy fast. And now, some believe XRP could come out on top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market\u2014Data Elon Musk-Trump Feud Spurs Crypto Talk Musk took to Twitter on June 4 to slam what he called reckless government spending. His post warned of \u201cserious economic risks.\u201d Not long after, Trump fired back. He threatened to pull subsidies and contracts tied to Tesla. That response sent Tesla\u2019s stock tumbling. Investors watched $150 billion in market value vanish in a matter of hours. Market Moves And Price Swings Based on reports, Bitcoin slid more than 5% following the news. It dropped to a low of $100,550 before finding a bit of footing near $102,400. XRP wasn\u2019t spared either. It fell alongside other major coins, though the exact drop varied across exchanges. Traders saw quick declines, then a modest rebound as the dust settled. I believe @elonmusk will do anything to make @Ripple $XRP as a chosen one and use it on @x while knowing that @EricTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, and @realDonaldTrump will watch @worldlibertyfi and @bitcoin crashing in front of their eyes. Right, @elonmusk? \u2014 Joshua Dalton (@J9Dalton) June 5, 2025 XRP Community Weighs In Joshua Dalton, who founded tech services firm TRIBLU, stirred the pot with a bold claim. He suggested Musk might choose XRP as the main currency for X\u2019s upcoming payment system, X Money. Dalton argued that Musk \u201cwill do anything\u201d to make XRP the go-to token. He tagged Ripple, Musk, US President Trump, and Trump\u2019s sons in a single post. That move framed the drama as more than just politics\u2014it became a showdown of crypto loyalties. Technical Fit For X Money XRP provides quicker settlement and reduced fees than Bitcoin. In 2021, Musk suspended BTC payments for Tesla due to high energy consumption and centralized mining concerns. That move proved he&#8217;s not afraid to change course when a coin isn&#8217;t aligned with his objectives. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger In October 2024, Musk even referenced XRP in a viral video. He spoke of crypto like XRP potentially resisting central control, but he did not go so far as to make a full endorsement. With X Money scheduled to roll out later in 2025, XRP&#8217;s architecture for cross-border transfers could mirror what Musk is looking to create. Some analysts point out real hurdles. Ripple still holds a large chunk of XRP, and US regulators are watching closely. Any big move would need legal green lights and deep liquidity on exchanges. But for now, the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d powered by XRP keeps popping up in crypto chats. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-key-range-support-after-pullback-bulls-eye-3000-level/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has faced a sharp pullback, dropping over 10% in the last 24 hours as global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty shake investor confidence across markets. The retrace comes amid rising US bond yields and escalating trade conflict rhetoric between major global powers, particularly the United States and China. While Bitcoin holds strong above key support levels, altcoins\u2014including Ethereum\u2014are under pressure, prompting caution among short-term traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 \u2013 Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash However, some analysts believe this dip could present an opportunity rather than a threat. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights suggesting that Ethereum is holding range support well, even after the sharp decline. According to Pillows, ETH\u2019s ability to stay above critical support zones is a positive sign, with a potential breakout toward higher levels if it manages to reclaim momentum within the range. The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. If market volatility calms and Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $100K, Ethereum could lead the next leg up, opening the door for a strong altseason. For now, traders are closely watching how ETH behaves around its current support to determine whether a deeper correction or a bullish reversal is in play. Ethereum Holds Range Support Amid Market Volatility Ethereum is showing resilience despite heightened macro uncertainty and political tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Following a sharp pullback, ETH has managed to defend key support levels, with bulls stepping in near the $2,400 zone. This recovery comes at a time when the crypto market is on edge, reacting to broader financial market volatility and shifting sentiment across global assets. ETH remains approximately 48% below its all-time high, leaving substantial upside potential if momentum continues to build. The coming weeks will be decisive, especially as Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000 and traders look to Ethereum and altcoins for the next leg higher. Despite global headwinds, including inflation and escalating trade tensions, Ethereum is maintaining strength within its current range. Pillows emphasized in a recent analysis that Ethereum is holding range support nicely after the dump. According to his view, reclaiming this range is a key signal that bulls remain in control. If ETH can break through near-term resistance levels and reclaim the $2,600 mark, it opens the door for a push toward $3,000 \u2014 a psychological and technical milestone. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop \u2013 Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Rebounds As Consolidation Continues Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,466, holding just above the 34-day EMA at $2,422 after a volatile week. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains inside a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700. Despite recent pressure across altcoins, ETH has managed to avoid a breakdown and is attempting to stabilize above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The chart shows that ETH\u2019s recent pullback stopped just before the 100-day SMA (~$2,068), a level that has acted as a strong dynamic support in past cycles. Holding this structure is critical for the bullish outlook to remain intact. If bulls can push the price back above the 200-day SMA at $2,666, Ethereum could attempt a breakout above $2,700 \u2014 a move that would likely open the door to $3,000 and signal renewed strength in the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure \u2013 Bearish Target At $142 Volume has remained moderate, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before entering new positions. As long as ETH holds above the $2,400\u2013$2,450 region, the bullish thesis remains valid. A daily close below $2,400, however, could expose the asset to a deeper correction toward the $2,200 zone, where the 100-day EMA provides additional technical support.

      "summary": "Bitcoin made a new all-time high on May 22 when it crossed $112K. Although it dipped below $100K soon after, it&#8217;s now showing signs of recovery and a potential run upwards. Carlo Pruscino from CMC Markets believes that a Fed rate cut might drive $BTC back to $112K and potentially even beyond. Keep reading to find out Trump&#8217;s stance on a potential Fed rate cut, when we can expect one, and what the best altcoins to buy are to make the most of this pro-crypto situation. Trump Wants a Rate Cut Now Trump took to Truth Social to criticize the Fed on delayed rate cuts. He said that Europe has already had 10 rate cuts while the US is lagging behind. He also pointed out there\u2019s no inflation anymore \u2013 in case that\u2019s what is holding back the Fed. He said that if inflation were to come back, the Fed could simply raise the interest rate again. As of now, though, Trump believes that the US is paying a lot more in borrowing costs than it should. It&#8217;s worth noting that the Federal Reserve has been mulling over rate cuts for quite some time. However, Trump\u2019s ongoing trade tariff war and uncertain trade policies have held it from making a decisive move. The current borrowing rate is 4.25%\u20134.50%. As per CME Group&#8217;s data, 97.5% of market participants believe that this will remain unchanged in the upcoming Fed meeting on June 18. More than 51% of people believe that a rate cut might come around mid-September, where rates may be slashed by 25 basis points. If we see a rate cut earlier than expected, $BTC may be the first major asset to react. When&#8230;further rate cuts come, if they\u2019re coming a lot sooner than expected, that will then impact heavily on the future price moves or crypto on Bitcoin and some other cryptos as well. \u2013 Carlo Pruscino, a CMC Markets analyst To help you make the most out of upcoming policy changes, we&#8217;ve handpicked the best cryptos to invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now, Free $BTC Airdrops Bitcoin will almost certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rising crypto market. In fact, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is what will pull the crypto market to new highs in the first place. As such, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), a Bitcoin-inspired meme coin, is the best crypto to buy if you&#8217;re bullish on $BTC and want to maximize your returns. Unlike other altcoins, $BTCBULL token holders will be rewarded with free $BTC. This will happen on two occasions: once when Bitcoin reaches $150K and another when it reaches $200K for the first time. Just make sure to store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events, which will take place on social media. In addition to having a genuine shot at grabbing real $BTC, you&#8217;ll also benefit from a monstrous rise in $BTCBULL&#8217;s price. According to our BTC Bull Token price prediction, the token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 \u2013 a 276% rise from current prices. Buy $BTCBULL now for just $0.00255 each. The project is in presale, where it has amassed nearly $7M. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) \u2013 First-Ever Solana Layer-2, Insane $45M Presale Raise A rise in Bitcoin will likely lead to joyous times in the meme coin market as well, which is why we believe that Solaxy ($SOLX) could be one of the next cryptos to explode. Designed to strengthen the best blockchain for meme coins, $SOLX is being hyped as Solana&#8217;s prodigal son, and for good reason. After all, Solaxy will finally cure Solana of its congestion and scalability issues, which it has been facing ever since the success of $TRUMP and other viral meme coins overloaded it. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which will offload transactions from the mainnet onto a sidechain. This will reduce the workload on Solana, thereby restoring its lightning-fast executions. Furthermore, this brand-new L2 will also process transactions in bulk, which will decrease the overall cost requirements on Solana. To participate in Solaxy&#8217;s one-of-a-kind mission and token growth \u2013 it&#8217;s predicted to rise by over 11,300% by 2030 \u2013 become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale, with over $45M raised, and you can get each token for just $0.001748. Here&#8217;s how to buy it. 3. PepeCoin ($PEP) \u2013 Pepe-Inspired Meme Coin Currently Among the Top Gainers Although you wouldn&#8217;t be wrong to think that PepeCoin ($PEP) borrows its popularity from the legendary $PEPE meme coin, it&#8217;s got a handful of unique features that have had a fair bit of say in it being one of the top trending cryptos. For instance, PepeCoin runs on its own blockchain, which is how it offers astonishingly low transaction fees and zero $ETH gas fees. Coming to its performance, $PEP is up over 3,000% since its inception in June 2024. More recently, the token has recorded 28% gains over the past thirty days. According to price action analysis, $PEP is closing in on a major resistance level ($0.00024), a break of which could see the token soar to $0.00027 and beyond. The Best Altcoins to Benefit from a Rate Cut, but They\u2019re Not Completely Dependent on It With a rate cut on the horizon, major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum could finally start rallying \u2013 and the altcoin space will only get more bullish. While new cryptos, like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Solaxy ($SOLX), will indeed benefit from increased public borrowing and investment, their solid fundamentals and community hype will likely see them rising regardless. However, make sure you do your own research and due diligence before investing. Our articles aren&#8217;t financial advice, after all."

      "title": "The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62%",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin-dominance/",
      "summary": "One of the reasons that the altcoin season seemed to not have begun until now is the fact that Bitcoin has dominated the market recovery, and thus, the BTC dominance remains very high. For the altcoin season to actually begin, past market performances show that there needs to be a major decline in the Bitcoin dominance. This is the ultimate trigger the market needs to confirm that altcoins will begin their own independent run. Bitcoin Dominance Needs To Fall To 62% The Bitcoin dominance is still trending at a high 64%, and this continues to be a thorn in the side of altcoins. With the dominance this high, the Bitcoin price continues to dictate where the market goes and has seen altcoins suffer crashes as a result of even the tiniest movement triggering a decline in prices. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? However, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend has pointed out an interesting formation in the chart, which is a 7-wave crashing pattern. This pattern has been completed, and this signals a possible drop in the Bitcoin dominance as time goes on. The last phase of the 7-wave pattern was when the dominance hit a peak of 64.6% before declining back down toward 64%. This pattern suggests that the Bitcoin dominance could possibly drop to 62%, which would be good news for those waiting for the altcoin season. The last time that the dominance was this low was back on May 14, and altcoins had rallied hard as a result. For this decline to be completed, the crypto analyst reveals that confirmation lies below 63.45%, as this is the Wave 6 lows. Once this support is broken, a sharp drop toward 62% is expected from here. As the analyst explains, \u201creal momentum kicks in under 62%,\u201d and this is when altcoin season moves with full force. Altcoin Season Is Not Over The topic of a possible altcoin season is currently one of the most debated in the crypto community as market participants remain split on where it is in the cycle. Some have said there will be no altcoin season similar to what was seen in 2021, while others have maintained that it is still possible. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Averages $2 Billion In June As Price Struggles Below $0.2 One analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has lent their voice, pushing the narrative that the altcoin season is far from over. For a 2021-style altcoin season to happen, though, the crypto analyst says the altcoin market, which excludes the top 10 cryptos by market cap, must break above the $470 billion resistance like it did in previous cycles. Once this happens, then they expect the altcoin season to begin. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"
