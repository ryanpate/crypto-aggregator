      "summary": "Canada\u2019s Toronto Stock Exchange today saw a new entrant aimed at making XRP more accessible to investors. The 3iQ Corp. rolled out its spot-based XRP ETF, trading under the ticker XRPQ, with an introductory 0% management fee for the first six months. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Based on reports, this move offers both retail and institutional clients a hands\u2011off way to own XRP without worrying about private wallets or unregulated platforms. Building Trust Through Custody According to the announcement, XRPQ will hold its XRP coins in cold storage, kept separate for each investor to cut down the chance of a hack. The fund plans to buy XRP from regulated sources like over\u2011the\u2011counter desks. That setup mirrors what other digital\u2011asset funds do for Bitcoin and Ether. We are excited to announce the launch of the 3iQ XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U) \u2014 one of the first ETFs in North America to provide exposure to #XRP. XRPQ debuts with a 0% management fee for the first six months, and @Ripple as an early investor in the fund. \u201cThe launch of XRPQ\u2026 pic.twitter.com/me19RLAzJI \u2014 3iQ Digital Asset Management (@3iq_corp) June 18, 2025 Backing From Ripple San Francisco\u2019s Ripple has taken a stake in the new fund, according to reports. The company didn\u2019t share how much it invested, but its support sends a strong message. It shows Ripple believes in XRPQ\u2019s structure and security, even after years of uncertainty about XRP in the US courts. Growth Of XRP Over A Decade Data from 2015 to now shows that XRP\u2019s price jumped to around 10,700%, climbing from $0.02 back then to $2.16 today. That surge underscores why 3iQ\u2019s CEO and President, Pascal St\u2011Jean, called this ETF \u201can easy way for Canadians and qualified investors overseas to tap into XRP\u2019s growth.\u201d He rang the TSX\u2019s closing bell to mark the launch. Purpose Joins The Fray Reports also disclose that Purpose Investments launched its own XRP ETF, XRPP, on the same day. That makes two spot XRP ETFs now available on the same exchange. Both products aim to give investors a regulated path to XRP, but only time will tell which approach wins more fans.

With XRPQ\u2019s debut, 3iQ highlights its mission of opening up digital assets in a regulated way. It\u2019s a clear sign that more traditional markets are warming up to crypto. And with Ripple\u2019s backing and a zero\u2011fee for half a year, this new ETF could draw attention from anyone who wants XRP exposure without the usual hurdles.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-analyst-eyes-high-timeframe-close-range-break-above-2800-could-be-violent/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is currently facing a pivotal moment as it continues to consolidate below the $3,000 level. Bulls are targeting a breakout above this key resistance zone, which could trigger a major upward move. However, broader market conditions remain fragile. Geopolitical tensions\u2014particularly the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran\u2014continue to create a high-risk macroeconomic environment, leading to increased volatility and intermittent selling pressure across risk assets. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% Despite these challenges, ETH has shown resilience by holding above the $2,500 support zone. The price has remained locked in a narrow trading range for weeks, reflecting market indecision and caution among participants. According to a technical analysis shared by top analyst Daan, Ethereum continues to trade within this very tight range, with price wicks on both sides consistently getting absorbed. This type of price action signals growing compression, often a precursor to a strong directional move once one side gives in. Traders are now closely monitoring the structure for a higher timeframe close above $2,800, which could validate bullish momentum and open the path toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, the market appears balanced, and any shift in geopolitical developments may quickly tilt sentiment in either direction. Ethereum Prepares For Breakout as Market Awaits Confirmation Ethereum remains over 60% below its 2024 high of $4,100, but the asset is showing signs of recovery after months of downward pressure and indecision. Bulls have struggled to regain control throughout the year, but recent price action indicates the start of a potential rally. This recovery, however, remains tentative and will require confirmation through a higher timeframe close above critical resistance levels, particularly the $2,800\u2013$3,000 range. The broader environment continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. Escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty\u2014including rising U.S. Treasury yields and concerns about inflation\u2014are creating headwinds for risk assets, Ethereum included. Despite this, ETH has managed to hold key support above the $2,500 level, a sign that bulls are defending their ground. According to technical analysis shared by analyst Daan, Ethereum is currently trading within a very tight range, with price wicks on both sides being consistently absorbed. This type of compression typically signals an incoming surge in volatility. Daan notes that once one side gives in, the resulting move often becomes explosive and sustained. The current range-bound action reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers, but that balance won\u2019t last forever. Traders are watching closely for a decisive higher timeframe close above resistance\u2014or below support\u2014as confirmation of the next trend direction. With ETH positioned near major technical zones, a breakout could lead to significant momentum, potentially bringing Ethereum closer to reclaiming the psychological $3,000 mark and reigniting a push toward cycle highs. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low \u2013 No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Ethereum Continues Range-Bound Trading As Key Support Holds Ethereum (ETH) remains locked in a tight range between approximately $2,500 and $2,800, showing little directional clarity over the past several weeks. The chart above (12-hour timeframe) reflects persistent consolidation with multiple wicks on both ends of the candles, indicating absorption of both bullish and bearish momentum. This suggests that neither buyers nor sellers have taken firm control. ETH currently trades near $2,540 and is holding above the 100-period simple moving average (SMA), which is acting as short-term support. The 50 SMA has flattened, further reinforcing the sideways nature of the price action. Volume has also tapered off, typical in compression phases that often precede strong breakouts or breakdowns. If ETH fails to reclaim the $2,675\u2013$2,800 resistance zone, the 200 SMA near $2,117 may become relevant as a deeper support target. However, as long as ETH maintains price action above $2,500, bulls are still in play. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions \u2013 Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack The structure suggests that Ethereum is building energy for a decisive move. A higher timeframe close above $2,800 could trigger a new leg up toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a break below $2,500 could lead to renewed bearish pressure. For now, traders are watching for breakout confirmation. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-action-on-june-22/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price action is currently testing investors&#8217; nerves as it hovers around $100,000. While it flirts with this psychological level, analysts are highlighting June 22, 2025, as a key date for potential volatility. Backed by both historical volatility patterns and technical indicators, this date is gearing up to be a critical window for Bitcoin\u2019s next move. Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility On June 22 Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase as it trades above the $100,000 mark, with technical signals identified by TradingView expert \u2018readCrypto\u2019 aligning around a critical time frame\u2014-June 22. The chart analysis shows that June 22 is an important date, signaling the projected start of Bitcoin\u2019s next volatility window, with a potential to break out or break down depending on how the flagship cryptocurrency reacts to key support and resistance zones. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $104,731, close to a pivotal confluence range between $104,463 and $106,133\u2014a zone highlighted as a structural mid-point. This area is defined by the DOM (60) and a Heikin-Ashi high point on the price chart, marking the formation of a recent upper boundary. Moreover, the lower end of the range sits around $99,705, which is the HA-High support level, where the price has previously been tested but not yet broken. According to the analyst, the June 22 date is important because it coincides with the confluence of key price levels with the M-Signal indicator on the weekly chart. This indicator is currently rising and aligning near the $99,705 HA-high level. If Bitcoin falls below this level, it could signal the start of a deeper corrective move, possibly toward the monthly M-Signal line or even the $89,294 region, corresponding with the 2.618 Fibonacci. Conversely, if Bitcoin holds above this level and breaks out of the $108,316 resistance, momentum could shift back to the upside. The analyst has set upper bullish targets near $109,598 and $111,696, reflecting the final resistance zone before new highs. Support Zones And Momentum Indicate Tense Standoff Moving past readCrypto\u2019s volatility-driven projection, the TradingView analyst\u2019s Bitcoin chart shows that the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) oscillator remains below the zero line. This suggests that despite recent gains, selling pressure may still be dominating the broader market. However, the histogram in the chart shows signs of waning momentum on the sell side. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 This divergence aligns with Bitcoin\u2019s weakening Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates momentum may be cooling. The low OBV readings, combined with the recent bounce from a lower support range, also underscore an intense standoff within the market. If Bitcoin breaks below the Heikin Ashi high point at $99,705, a retest of new lows at $89,294 is more than likely. Until then, readCrypto\u2019s analysis shows that all eyes are on the $104,000 to $106,000 zone. The area between $99,705 and $108,316 now defines the high-boundary consolidation range. A confirmed move outside this range, mainly triggered during the June 21-13 window, could dictate Bitcoin\u2019s next major move. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-mirrors-bitcoin-2017-2021-pattern-4000-is-the-trigger-point/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading within a tight range that has held for several weeks, forming the kind of compression structure that often leads to a significant breakout. Despite heightened volatility in global markets driven by escalating tensions in the Middle East, ETH has remained resilient, holding strong above key demand zones around the $2,500\u2013$2,600 area. The current environment is marked by uncertainty, with geopolitical conflict and macroeconomic risks weighing on investor sentiment. Yet Ethereum\u2019s price structure suggests that bulls are patiently building momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low \u2013 No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook, pointing out that Ethereum is mirroring the same consolidation pattern that Bitcoin followed during its 2017\u20132021 cycle. In that historical setup, BTC compressed into a tight range before entering a parabolic rally once the upper boundary was broken. If Ethereum follows a similar path, the next move could be dramatic, especially if it clears major resistance levels like $2,800. As long as ETH holds range support and absorbs both upside and downside wicks, this setup remains intact. A breakout above the current range could ignite a fresh leg up for Ethereum\u2014and possibly spark renewed strength across the altcoin market. Ethereum Builds Momentum As Market Awaits Clarity Ethereum is currently trading in a tight range, consolidating just above the $2,600 level and holding firm despite macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. After rallying nearly 80% from its April lows, ETH appears to be preparing for a decisive move in the coming sessions. However, with escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and uncertainty surrounding possible U.S. involvement, broader markets remain cautious. Until clarity emerges on the geopolitical front, sideways price action may persist. Still, Ethereum\u2019s price structure remains constructive. Strong consolidation above key demand zones reflects ongoing buyer interest and a lack of heavy selling pressure. This behavior often precedes major moves, as investors accumulate ahead of expected volatility. Some market participants remain cautious, warning of a possible retrace below the $2,400 level if demand falters or broader risk sentiment weakens. In contrast, bullish analysts like Ted Pillows suggest a more optimistic outlook. According to Pillows, Ethereum is closely following the path Bitcoin took during its 2017\u20132021 cycle, where tight consolidation ultimately led to a breakout and parabolic rally. In this view, ETH\u2019s real explosive phase won\u2019t begin until it breaks above $4,000. If this scenario plays out, Ethereum could trigger a broader altcoin surge and shift overall crypto market sentiment bullish once again. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% ETH Technical Analysis: Consolidation Near Key Levels The 3-day Ethereum chart shows a prolonged consolidation phase as ETH trades near the $2,500 mark. Despite geopolitical uncertainty and rising macroeconomic risks, Ethereum has held above the $2,400 support zone, forming a tight range just below the critical resistance at $2,775. This area also coincides with the 200-day SMA (red line), which continues to cap upward momentum. ETH remains above the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) SMAs, suggesting bullish momentum is intact, though lacking follow-through. The recent candle bodies show decreasing volatility, with wicks on both sides being absorbed\u2014a classic sign of compression that often precedes a large move. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching \u2013 Will History Repeat? Volume has declined slightly compared to the breakout in early May, indicating a temporary pause in bullish conviction. However, if Ethereum manages a higher close above the $2,775 resistance, it could trigger an impulsive breakout targeting the $3,000 level. On the downside, a break below $2,400 would invalidate the current structure and expose ETH to a deeper correction toward $2,100. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Crypto analyst XForce has again alluded to the 5-Wave count to show when the XRP Price is likely to hit a new all-time high (ATH) above $5. As part of his analysis, the analyst also declared that there is no reason to be bearish on the altcoin at the moment. XRP To Rally Above $5 Based On 5-Wave Count In an X post, XForce shared an accompanying chart that showed that XRP could rally above $5 on the Wave 3 impulsive move to the upside. The altcoin could even rally to double digits and touch $13 on this move. The chart also showed that XRP will reach this target by year-end or early next year. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move Coming? Based on the 5-Wave count, XRP will then witness a price correction to around $5 on Wave 4 before it then rallies to around $25 on Wave 5, an impulsive move to the upside. XForce is confident that the current price action is going according to plan. He noted that the macro direction was met with very little margin of error. Furthermore, the crypto analyst remarked that everything from the Wave 4 triangle breakout to the anticipated 1 to 2 pullback following the 5-wave impulse followed the blueprint. In line with this, he declared that there is no valid reason to adopt a bearish stance unless the market invalidates the bullish case for XRP. XForce also affirmed that XRP is within the bounds of the same two scenarios but that the ultra-bullish scenario of a rally to double digits is gaining more credibility by the day. The more conservative scenario for the altcoin is a rally to $4, which could still mark a new all-time high for XRP. The analyst earlier declared that all scenarios on the medium timeframe still show the altcoin reaching a new ATH in this market cycle. XRP Consolidation Has Reached Its Peak In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and that something big is coming next. She remarked that the altcoin could either record an explosive breakout or see one final sharp drop to support that ignites a breakout. Either way, XRP looks likely to rally to the upside soon. Related Reading: XRP Price At $27: Guardian Arch Formation Predictions 1,000% Move CasiTrades stated that the XRP price continues to struggle with the $2.25 level. As long as this level remains resistance, she claimed that it increases the likelihood of the altcoin dropping to support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and even $1.55. However, the analyst declared that these aren\u2019t bearish targets but momentum zones, where the market grabs the liquidity it needs to build momentum for Wave 3. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
