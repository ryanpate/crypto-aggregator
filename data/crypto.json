      "summary": "TRON\u2019s token TRX has barely budged despite a flurry of on\u2011chain action. Traders saw a 5% gain over the past week and a measly 0.50% uptick in the last 24 hours. But behind those mild price moves, there\u2019s a storm of activity that could shape how TRX fares in the days ahead. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Surge In On\u2011Chain Activity According to data from Artemis, daily transaction counts shot up to over 9 million, up from 7.5 million the day before. That jump in numbers sent active addresses soaring. On\u2011chain participants climbed to 2.7 million, marking the highest level since June 6. Based on reports, much of this traffic appears tied to stablecoin transfers rather than new users or fresh investment. The spike in transaction volume doesn\u2019t match TRX\u2019s price action. That gap hints at wallets moving funds out of exchanges, routing payments, or chasing yield elsewhere. Users aren\u2019t rushing to hold TRX for its own sake. They\u2019re using the network as a highway and then driving off into other chains. TRX market cap currently at $26.8 billion. Chart: TradingView Stablecoin Outflows Hit Record High According to Artemis, TRON\u2019s stablecoin supply hit $80 billion in June, setting a new milestone for the network. Since then, about $185 million worth of stablecoins have fled the chain. That outflow marks a sharp reversal in user habits. People who once parked their USDT and other tokens on TRON look to be shifting them to new destinations. The pullback follows a broader rotation in crypto markets where investors chase better rates or lower fees. TRON once drew crowds for its low transaction costs. Now, competing chains and Layer 2 platforms are undercutting its edge. That has cut into TRX\u2019s role as the network\u2019s workhorse token. Revenue And TVL Take A Hit Artemis figures show that TRX\u2019s total revenue plunged to just $114,000 in a single day. That number sits at a four\u2011year low. Network fees in TRON come from \u201cbandwidth\u201d and \u201cenergy,\u201d so when users batch transfers or switch to zero\u2011fee bridges, fee income collapses fast. Based on data from DeFiLlama, total value locked on TRON protocols fell by 0.50% in 24 hours, a drop from $4.80 billion to $4.85 billion. That\u2019s about $26 million walking out the door. While a half\u2011percent move might look small, it underlines a trend. Every million dollars that leaves makes it tougher for lending pools and yield farms to keep their rates up. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Near Pain Point Last Seen In October 2024 Despite the outflows, TRX hasn\u2019t broken key support levels yet. It still trades above areas that buyers defended in late spring. But if TVL keeps sliding and stablecoins continue to exit, we could see more pressure on the token\u2019s price.

      "summary": "Dogecoin has observed a rebound from the support line of a Parallel Channel. Here&#8217;s where the next target could lie, according to an analyst. Dogecoin Found Support At Lower Level Of This Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the daily Dogecoin price is currently looking from the perspective of a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset&#8217;s price witnesses consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel tracks successive highs, and the lower one lows. Related Reading: This Altcoin Looks Like PEPE Before It Exploded, Analyst Says The cryptocurrency breaking out of either of these levels implies a continuation of the trend in that direction. A surge above the channel is a bullish signal, while a fall under it is a bearish one. There are three different types of Parallel Channels. The Ascending variation occurs when the trendlines are sloped upwards. That is, it represents a phase of consolidation to the upside. Similarly, the Descending type involves the asset going down with time. In the context of the current topic, the third and most common variant is of interest. This type signifies a phase of true sideways movement, with the channel being parallel to the time-axis. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-day price of Dogecoin has been moving inside for the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin daily price recently saw a brief retest of the lower level of the Parallel Channel. This line of the pattern is generally considered a level of support, and indeed, it played this role during the recent retest as well by helping the memecoin to turn around. DOGE has since been on the way up. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is now targeting the $0.19 level, situated at the midway point of the Parallel Channel. In the event that Dogecoin can clear this level, it&#8217;s possible that the coin may set its sights on the $0.26 mark next. This price corresponds to the upper level of the pattern, which provided resistance to the memecoin on a couple of occasions in May. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Upper Bound Is $117,000, Glassnode Says From the current exchange rate, a surge to this line would imply an increase of more than 50%.
