      "summary": "Amid the geopolitical turmoil, Solana (SOL) has retraced 10% in the past week. Some analysts believe that the altcoin\u2019s correction is about to end, but warned that a dip below a key support level might come first. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For New Highs As Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $5 Solana Eyes Key Retest Before Breakout After retesting the $168 resistance last Wednesday, Solana has fallen back to a key level fueled by the recent market pullback. The cryptocurrency has seen a 15% retracement from its monthly highs, trading around the $140 zone for the past three days. SOL has been hovering between the $145-$180 price range since its May breakout, falling to the range lows during the June market shakeouts. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to reclaim the $160-$170 mid-zone. Nonetheless, market watcher Lluciano considers that Solana \u201cmay dip a bit more, but the ultimate target is seriously huge.\u201d The analyst highlighted SOL\u2019s performance since April, noting that it ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March. After this price action, SOL retested the $100-$120 demand zone before breaking out to its current range in the following weeks. Now, the altcoin\u2019s chart displays a one-month falling wedge pattern, with the upper boundary sitting around the $155-$160 area. To the analyst, a breakout from this pattern could send the cryptocurrency toward May\u2019s $187 high resistance before propelling the price to retest the $240 mark. Similarly, trader Rose noted that SOL has been consolidating above the key $145 resistance and 50-day Moving Average (MA), signaling a potential breakout. \u201cIf confirmed, the price could rise toward targets at $165, $183, and $220,\u201d they suggested. SOL To Underperform In Coming Months? Market watcher Crypto Bullet suggested that Solana\u2019s correction is coming to an end. The analyst forecasted that SOL could soon lose its current range and retest the April consolidation range, around the $125-$135 area, to complete the correction. This would be followed by a bounce back into the current range before surging past the $200 barrier toward the $220-$250 targets, for \u201cone more wave up\u201d this cycle. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa affirmed Solana won\u2019t outperform like it did during the first half of the cycle. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency won\u2019t outperform Bitcoin (BTC) on any long-term timeframe \u201cother than a few blips here and there.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Setting Up For \u2018Large Move\u2019 Amid $103,000 Retest \u2013 Key Levels To Watch He explained that the cycle\u2019s leading altcoin isn\u2019t \u201cdead,\u201d but that he doesn\u2019t \u201csee it having a run like it did in 2021/2024.\u201d Notably, SOL is currently retesting its late November 2023 support levels against BTC, which previously sent it to yearly lows after failing to hold them. Altcoin Sherpa concluded that Solana will likely continue to climb against its USDT pair but continue to bleed in its SOL/BTC chart. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $145, a 12.1% decline in the monthly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Although Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) momentum has stalled over the past week due to escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the flagship cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern on the three-day chart &#8211; significantly increasing the likelihood of a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Bitcoin Eyeing New ATH Soon? In an X post published today, crypto analyst Mister Crypto highlighted that BTC is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the three-day chart. The analyst shared the following chart, noting that a successful breakout could propel Bitcoin\u2019s price as high as $150,000. For the uninitiated, the inverse head &#38; shoulders is a bullish chart pattern that signals a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It consists of three troughs, a lower low &#8211; called the &#8220;head&#8221; &#8211; between two higher lows &#8211; called the &#8220;shoulders.&#8221; This is followed by a breakout above the &#8220;neckline&#8221; resistance, indicating rising buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Despite ongoing uncertainty in the market, analysts remain largely optimistic. For example, noted analyst Jelle pointed out that BTC has formed a major bullish pennant above previous highs &#8211; another positive technical signal. BTC is also poised to benefit from shrinking supply on trading platforms. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto commentator Master of Crypto noted that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are about to fall below two million &#8211; the lowest level since 2017. Depleting BTC balances on exchanges suggest that investors are moving their Bitcoin to long-term storage, reducing the amount available for immediate sale. This supply constraint can create upward pressure on price, especially if demand continues to rise. Meanwhile, another Bitcoin analyst, apsk32, highlighted BTC\u2019s ongoing alignment with the power curve cycle. Remarkably, Bitcoin has followed this cycle consistently for 15 years, and if the trend holds, the next cycle top could occur in November or December 2025. BTC Quantity More Important Than Price In a separate X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki emphasized that the number of BTC one holds is more important than its current price. In a detailed thread, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Warning: Short-Term Holder Selling Accelerates Amid Price Correction While a $1 million price target may seem ambitious, other analysts also forecast new highs in the near term.

In addition, exchange data suggests an impending supply crunch, as whales continue withdrawing large amounts of BTC while exchange inflows remain subdued.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-gears-60-move-will-it-be-up-or-down/",
      "summary": "An analyst has explained how Dogecoin could be primed for a 60% price move. Here&#8217;s the range that could end up deciding the direction of the break. Dogecoin Is Nearing The End Of A Triangle Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin is currently looking from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 1-day price of DOGE. As displayed in the graph, the daily Dogecoin price has been trading inside what appears to be a triangular channel. A triangle is a TA pattern that forms whenever an asset&#8217;s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 13%: Can Key On-Chain Support Stop The Fall? The upper line of the pattern is likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower one support. A break out of either of the lines can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. There are a few different types of triangles, with a few popular ones being the Symmetrical, Ascending, and Descending variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides the type of the triangle. In a Symmetrical Triangle, the lines converge at a roughly equal and opposite slope. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, both upward and downward volatility shrinks in an even manner. For the Ascending and Descending versions, however, there is a bias to the upside or downside. In the former, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis and the price progressively makes higher lows. Similarly, the latter involves lower highs with a flat support level. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the Triangle that Dogecoin has been moving inside for the past few months is similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it has a slight tilt toward the downside. It&#8217;s also visible that DOGE is nearing in on the end of the triangle. Generally, triangle breakouts become more likely to occur as the asset approaches the apex, as the consolidation range squeezes tight in this region. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Bucking The Trend\u2014But Can They Keep It Up? Considering that Dogecoin may be in this zone now, it&#8217;s possible that its spring may be ready to uncoil. Based on the pattern forming in the daily price, the analyst has noted that DOGE looks primed for a 60% move. As for which way a break would happen, that naturally comes down to which line the memecoin exits the triangle from. &#8221; All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend,&#8221; notes Martinez. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, down more than 11% over the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com"
