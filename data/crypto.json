      "summary": "Cardano (ADA) has been struggling to hold some crucial levels over the month, falling to multi-month lows over the weekend. As the cryptocurrency attempts to hold a key support area, some analysts believe this make-or-break retest will determine its next big move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wobbles? Metaplanet Buys Big, Breaks $1 Billion Mark Cardano To See More Bleeding Cardano is recording a 4.5% daily increase after bouncing from the $0.51 area on Sunday. Notably, ADA was in a downtrend following its 3-year high of $1.32 in December 2024, which ended after the late April breakout and May bullish rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold its April-May range amid the June market pullback, losing the key $0.66 area ten days ago. Since then, Cardano has recorded seven consecutive red daily candles and fallen below the $0.60 support. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that Cardano\u2019s rally will be halted unless some ground is recovered. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency\u2019s multi-month price action \u201cended up being a classic distribution schematic\u201d after losing the $0.66 support. This would signal that ADA\u2019s uptrend has ended and a potential downtrend is ahead. \u201cAs long as we don&#8217;t reclaim $0.66, just expect further downtrend from now on,\u201d he asserted. Meanwhile, market watcher Man of Bitcoin highlighted the cryptocurrency\u2019s June downtrend, affirming that if the price remains below the descending trendline, downward pressure will persist. He added that \u201cOne more low in wave iv is still possible,\u201d hinting that a drop below the $0.50 could be on the horizon before the next wave up. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that \u201cit should be a brief wick to the downside\u201d as a \u201csustained break lower would weaken the bullish outlook.\u201d ADA Retest To Trigger Rally To $1? Amid the ongoing global war tensions, ADA\u2019s price retested the crucial $0.52 support on Sunday, hitting a four-month low of $0.51, before recovering and closing the week around the $0.54 mark. Market watcher Rose Premium Signals noted that a weekly close around the crucial $0.56 level would continue the possible double-bottom setup forming on ADA\u2019s chart. The analyst added that a confirmed rebound from the $0.54-$0-56 area could send the price to the initial $0.99 target and set the stage for a climb toward the $1.20 and $1.50 resistances. On the contrary, failing to hold this area could see Cardano lose its six-month price range and retrace to the $0.32 level. Meanwhile, Crypto Billion affirmed that Cardano appears to be forming a potential triple bottom structure, which could lead to a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support \u2013 $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move As the cryptocurrency retested the $0.50-$0.52 area over the weekend, the analyst highlighted that this key range had been held twice before since the November breakout. Additionally, he pointed out that ADA\u2019s price appears to be trading within a multi-month falling wedge pattern, which suggests a breakout toward the $1 mark if the price climbs toward the upper boundary. As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.54, a 15.6% decline in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin has rebounded slightly after dropping below the $100,000 mark, a decline attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions. The digital asset reached lows of approximately $98,974 following reports of US military strikes on Iran. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has regained some ground and is trading at $102,1010, representing a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours and a 5.82% decrease over the last week. Amid this price performance, recent on-chain analysis points to a phase of consolidation rather than a structural breakdown. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared in a QuickTake post that long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be maintaining their positions rather than exiting, indicating continued conviction despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Signal Consolidation, Not Capitulation According to Darkfost, the current market behavior is reflective of a quiet consolidation period, with long-term holders showing little inclination to sell. Based on the 30-day moving average of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), his analysis shows that the metric has stayed below the 0.8 threshold typically associated with major corrections. The value recently peaked at 0.6 before trending downward, suggesting limited market overheating at present levels. Darkfost emphasized that this moderation could precede a continuation of the broader bull cycle, mirroring past market structures where consolidation phases led to further price advances. He noted that past bull runs have often been characterized by a \u201cstaircase\u201d trajectory, periods of sideways or modest downward movement followed by renewed upward momentum. In this context, subdued sentiment may indicate that the market is preparing for a potential next leg higher. The analyst wrote: Importantly, this does not signal the end of the bull cycle. Instead, similar to the past two phases, we may once again see a staircase-like movement where consolidation is followed by another leg up. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move. Whale Behavior Remains Steady Amid Market Tensions Complementing this outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, provided insight into whale activity during the current consolidation phase. He noted that while the market setup resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021, key on-chain signals from whales have not aligned with those seen during that previous peak. Specifically, Ethereum transaction outflows, often used as a proxy for large investor exits, have not shown the kind of spikes observed during the 2021 market top. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Mignolet pointed out that although Ethereum has seen a gradual decline in market share relative to other layer-1 and layer-2 chains since 2020, its transactional data still maintains a strong correlation with Bitcoin price movements. The absence of aggressive exit activity among large holders suggests that major market participants are not rushing for the exits, despite heightened geopolitical uncertainty and short-term price volatility.
