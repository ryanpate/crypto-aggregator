      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-recovers-from-100k-dip-while-on-chain-data-shows-rising-miner-activity/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after a brief but sharp dip triggered by recent market turbulence linked to public tensions between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The price of BTC had dropped to nearly $100,000 during the height of the reaction, but has since rebounded. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,891, marking a steady recovery from the 24-hour low. While the broader crypto market continues to digest the fallout, new data suggests that another force, miner activity, is beginning to shape the near-term outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback or Setup? On-Chain Metrics Hint at What\u2019s Coming Next Bitcoin Surge in Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action According to on-chain analytics published by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the volume of BTC transferred to exchanges. Between May 19 and May 28, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day, levels not seen in previous market cycles. These inflows are often viewed as a proxy for miners&#8217; intent to sell, which could influence short-term supply dynamics and introduce added volatility to BTC\u2019s spot market performance. The rise in realized inflows from miners to exchanges is interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Since miners are key liquidity providers in the Bitcoin ecosystem, large-scale transfers to exchanges are typically seen as preparations to offload BTC. Historically, spikes in miner outflows have preceded periods of downward price pressure, particularly when they occur alongside fragile market conditions. CryptoOnchain emphasizes that while miner selling isn\u2019t inherently negative, it can impact short-term price stability. As a result, traders and investors often monitor these flows to better assess potential risks. When miner inflows surge, it reflects the sector\u2019s sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. CryptoOnchain noted: Paying close attention to these inflows\u2014especially during historical peaks like the current phase\u2014can help with risk management and more informed trading decisions. Hash Ribbon Signal Suggests Longer-Term Opportunity Amid rising sell pressure, another indicator is flashing a potential opportunity. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost noted that Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Ribbons indicator, a metric derived from comparing 30-day and 60-day moving averages of network hashrate, has recently produced a new buy signal. This metric is used to evaluate miner stress and recovery phases, and is generally interpreted as a signal that miners have gone through a period of capitulation and are now stabilizing or recovering. This signal has historically aligned with favorable long-term entry points, except in unique events like China\u2019s 2021 mining ban. While the short-term effects of mining stress may contribute to price weakness, analysts suggest that these periods often set the stage for longer-term rallies. When miner capitulation resolves, it can clear excess supply from the market and establish stronger support levels. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Bitcoin found its footing and climbed back to $104,400 by the time this report was filed. According to a recent analysis by crypto researcher Klarch, this pullback was expected and might just be a pit stop before another run to fresh highs. Recurring Cycle Patterns Based on examination by Klarch, Bitcoin tends to follow a familiar path after each halving. One year after the 2016 halving, it rose about 280%. After the 2020 halving, it jumped roughly 550% in 367 days. Right now, Bitcoin has only moved up around 70% in the 416 days since the last halving. Klarch points out that in past cycles, these numbers picked up speed after a slow start. So, he says, there\u2019s still room for more growth.

If Bitcoin\u2019s history repeats, the best gains could be just around the corner. Information from blockchain data supports this too. For example, trading volume and on-chain addresses hit new highs in recent weeks. That fits the pattern Klarch described\u2014after the initial rise, there\u2019s often a bigger rally. Signs Of The Next Surge Bitcoin set a record of $112,100 on January 20, then edged up to $111,980 on May 22. Rather than signaling an end, Klarch believes these milestones mark the start of a higher peak. He sees those moves as part of the cycle\u2019s build-up, not its climax. Based on his chart work, each cycle has multiple tops before it finally tops out. Klarch didn\u2019t offer an exact date for a new peak, but he did suggest that Bitcoin has not yet hit its ceiling. He notes that a series of all-time highs usually happens when sentiment is still turning positive. Once more traders feel FOMO, the price often accelerates rapidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market\u2014Data Demand And Liquidity Driving Price Liquidity pouring into the crypto market has been a key talking point. Klarch says that steady buys from institutions and US Bitcoin spot ETFs have made Bitcoin scarcer on exchanges. Michael Saylor&#8217;s Strategy and other big money players keep buying, which pushes supply lower. Based on figures presented by Klarch, this trend could lift Bitcoin to around $180,000\u2014a rise of about 75% from current levels. VanEck, an asset manager, has shared a similar target. That makes Klarch\u2019s outlook feel less like a lone voice. If big funds keep moving in and retail interest stays high, Bitcoin\u2019s price might stay on the upswing. However, any pause in ETF inflows or a sudden shift in global markets could change that story. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Crypto Insight UK has doubled down on a forecast that XRP must endure one last, violent shakeout before launching toward a long-awaited $10 milestone. In his latest video, the British analyst warned that \u201cthe most dense liquidity I\u2019ve seen in a long time for XRP\u201d still sits uncollected beneath current spot prices. Until that pool is swept, he argues, the market will not unlock the upside move he ultimately expects to carry the token into double-digit territory. XRP Needs One Last Flush \u201cXRP didn\u2019t come down as low as we wanted,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cIt did hit the first key area of liquidity, but it didn\u2019t take it all. That makes me think we\u2019ve got continued downside.\u201d In his own trading plan, the analyst has resting bids at roughly $2.01 and $1.95\u2014a zone he believes will be tested once leveraged longs capitulate. Only after that \u201cfinal flush,\u201d he contends, can a rally toward $10 begin in earnest. The call comes amid broader cross-asset strength that has so far failed to translate into a sustained altcoin breakout. Silver is challenging decade-old highs near $36 an ounce, uranium contracts are pressing their recent peaks, and the Nasdaq Composite remains within sight of its all-time high. Yet despite what he calls \u201ca broad-based commodities rally,\u201d the analyst maintains that crypto still needs one more washout to clear residual excess. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? Macro-political drama, he suggests, is only accelerating that process.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sees-negative-funding-on-binance-a-classic-setup-for-a-short-squeeze/",
      "summary": "As political tensions between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk escalated yesterday, the Bitcoin (BTC) market experienced a sharp shift in sentiment, with the funding rate on Binance flipping from positive to negative within hours. Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative On Binance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, BTC funding rates on Binance have once again turned negative, even as the top cryptocurrency continues to trade above the $100,000 mark at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum \u2018Highly Likely\u2019 To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows The analyst attributed the sudden reversal in funding &#8211; from +0.003 to -0.004 &#8211; to the public spat between Trump and Musk on social media. This rapid shift reflects growing fear among market participants amid heightened uncertainty. Following the sentiment shift, BTC fell from the mid-$100,000 range to a low of $100,984, according to CoinGecko. Over the past two weeks, the asset has declined by 4.1%. That said, the current dip may offer a prime buying opportunity to investors. If Bitcoin rebounds strongly, it could result in a strong resurgence in buying pressure, leading to a short squeeze that may propel BTC\u2019s price further up. Darkfost highlighted that there have been three instances during the current market cycle when BTC witnessed such deep negative funding. Notably, each of these instances were followed by a strong upward move in the cryptocurrency. For example, on October 16, 2023, BTC dipped into negative funding territory before rallying from $28,000 to $73,000. A similar pattern played out on September 9, 2024, when the asset surged from $57,000 to $108,000. The most recent case was on May 2, 2025, when BTC jumped from $97,000 to a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,000. If history repeats, then the market may see a new ATH for BTC in the coming weeks. Darkfost noted: Such extreme readings often mark moments of maximum pessimism, precisely the kind of sentiment that can precede a strong bullish reversal when the short term negativity is gone. Large Investors Increase BTC Exposure Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales &#8211; wallets holding large amounts of BTC &#8211; continue to accumulate at a rapid pace. Notably, new whales have acquired BTC worth $63 billion, reflecting strong confidence in the asset\u2019s near-term prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Supporting this bullish outlook, recent analysis by QCR Capital indicates that large investors expect BTC to surge to as high as $130,000 by the end of Q3 2025. Additionally, the realized cap held by long-term holders has surpassed $20 billion, reinforcing positive sentiment. That said, some analysts urge caution, expecting BTC to crash below $100,000 before resuming its bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,069, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply over the past 24 hours, nearing the $100,000 mark with an intraday low of $100,984. This price movement reflects increased volatility across the crypto market following a public exchange on social media between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Their clash appears to have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment among traders. In response, the global crypto market cap slipped 4%, falling from over $3.4 trillion yesterday to $3.33 trillion. Meanwhile, the broader market correction has not gone unnoticed in derivatives data. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 Derivative Metrics Reveal Bearish Sentiment Spike According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the Binance net taker volume, a metric that measures the difference between aggressive longs and shorts, fell dramatically from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This signals a sharp pivot in sentiment, as traders rushed to hedge or speculate on downside risk in response to the unfolding news. Darkfost emphasized that this was the largest intraday net taker volume reversal observed on Binance this year. The abrupt shift reflects how quickly sentiment can change when macro-level narratives or influential figures dominate headlines. In this case, the market responded swiftly to perceived uncertainty, leading to a concentration of short positions and significant selling pressure. The situation also led to a notable change in BTC perpetual futures funding rates. Funding on Binance turned negative after briefly trending toward positive territory, dropping from +0.003 to below -0.004. This indicates that short sellers were willing to pay a premium to maintain bearish positions, underscoring rising fear and potentially overextended downside bets. \ud83d\udd14When Funding rates turns negative. \ud83d\udd39 Buying or considering a long position is often wise when funding rates turn highly negative, especially if the price starts to trend upward.

Darkfost noted three previous events where similar funding shifts led to large rallies: October 2023 (BTC surged from $28,000 to $73,000), September 2024 (from $57,000 to $108,000), and May 2025 (from $97,000 to $111,000).

Still, many traders are watching closely for signs of a short squeeze, where price rebounds force short sellers to cover, amplifying upward momentum.
