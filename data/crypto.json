      "summary": "On-chain data shows the large Bitcoin investors have added to their holdings in the past week, a sign that could be bullish for BTC&#8217;s price. Bitcoin Investors With 10 To 10,000 BTC Have Added To Their Holdings In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 BTC investors. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us about the total number of tokens that a particular wallet group is carrying right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Fails To Hype Retail\u2014Demand Is Actually Down Addresses or investors are placed into these cohorts based on the size of their balance. For example, the 1 to 10 coins group includes all holders owning between 1 and 10 tokens of the cryptocurrency. In the context of the current discussion, the groups lying inside the 10 to 10,000 BTC range are of interest. This wide range includes some of the key holders of the sector like the sharks and whales. These investors own significant holdings, so their behavior can often be worth keeping an eye on. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution of the 10 to 10,000 BTC holders over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 BTC investors has registered a significant jump over the past week, implying this group has purchased a net number of coins. More specifically, the members of the cohort have collectively added 79,244 BTC to their wallets in this period. At the current exchange rate, this amount converts to a whopping $8.3 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3\u20135 Year Holders Slow Selloff\u2014Waiting for Higher Prices? From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that this accumulation from the key investors has arrived while BTC has been going down after forming a new all-time high (ATH). This could be a potential indication that these holders still believe in the rally and see this drawdown as just a dip opportunity. That said, the 10 to 10,000 range is a bit wide, so while it does include the big-money investors, it also mixes up their behavior with some of the less-significant hands. Fortunately for Bitcoin, it would appear that the whales (1,000 to 10,000 BTC) agree with this trend of buying, as the chart shared by analyst Ali Martinez implies. As displayed in the graph, the whales of the cryptocurrency have added around 30,000 tokens to their holdings during the past few days, meaning that it&#8217;s not just the mid-sized hands buying this dip.

Amid last week\u2019s market pullback, the cryptocurrency retraced around 11% from its three-month high of $2,788 to the range\u2019s lower boundary, bouncing from this area on Monday. At the start of the week, ETH reclaimed the $2,500 mark and continued its recovery rally toward the $2,600 resistance.

Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent performance, affirming that Ethereum is \u201cshowing confidence\u201d by staying inside a key formation in the daily timeframe. According to the chart, Ethereum has been forming an ascending triangle since the May rally, with the upper line around the $2,680-$2,700 mark. Moreover, ETH\u2019s price has been compressing between the support and resistance lines, suggesting a potential 15% move if the price breaks out of the pattern. Runefelt forecasted a surge toward the $3,100 level if the Altcoin reclaims the crucial resistance level. However, if the price is rejected once again from this level, the analyst considers that Ethereum could drop to the $2,300 support zone.

      "summary": "Bitcoin is so far facing a notable pullback in price, with its price now down roughly 5.8% from its all-time high recorded last month. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades at $105,062, marking a 1.1% decrease in the past day. Despite the pullback, on-chain data indicates a significant change in market behavior among large investors. A new set of Bitcoin whales\u2014wallets holding 1,000 BTC or more with coins aged less than six months\u2014has been accumulating the asset at an accelerated pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift Young Whale Holdings Surge as Supply Share Tightens According to a recent analysis published by CryptoQuant contributor \u201conchained,\u201d this accumulation trend may reflect renewed conviction among high-capital participants preparing for future catalysts. Between March 1 and June 4, 2025, the amount of Bitcoin held by this group of \u201cnew whales\u201d more than doubled from approximately 500,000 BTC to over 1.1 million BTC. This represents an increase of around $63 billion in value. During the same period, their share of Bitcoin\u2019s total circulating supply grew from 2.5% to 5.6%, effectively removing an amount equivalent to nearly ten months of Bitcoin mining output from active circulation. Notably, this measure excludes long-dormant wallets, helping isolate recent capital inflows. This trend suggests a combination of long-term positioning and active supply absorption, which historically has preceded significant price volatility. Analysts view the emergence of new whale activity as a signal of shifting market structure, especially when paired with tightening supply conditions. If these entities continue to withdraw BTC from circulation without signs of immediate distribution, it could signal a period of price compression followed by upside volatility. Technical Patterns Suggest Possible Breakout Levels From a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin may be forming a new bullish pattern. According to a recent post by the analyst known as \u201cTitan of Crypto,\u201d the asset has broken out of a right-angled descending broadening wedge, a chart pattern that can imply a trend reversal or continuation depending on confirmation. #Bitcoin to $135,000 in 2025? \ud83d\udcc8$BTC has broken out of a right-angled descending broadening wedge.

Jamie Dimon, the CEO of a major bank, recently called that plan a waste. Lummis pushed back. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Lummis told Bloomberg the military thinks having Bitcoin on hand matters. She said it could be a tool in the economic contest with China. Some see that as a bold step. Others say it\u2019s risky. Military Backs Bitcoin Reserve According to the senator, military leaders say Bitcoin could help in an economic showdown. They see it as a way to hold value if traditional assets get hit by sanctions or big moves from other nations. She spoke about weapons and ammunitions being part of national security, but she added that a Bitcoin reserve is also vital. Some military voices have warned that future conflicts won\u2019t just be fought on battlefields. Money and digital assets could play a key role too. Legislative And Executive Moves Based on reports, Lummis introduced a bill to have the US buy and hold 1 million BTC. That would mirror what countries do with gold. The idea is to pull funds from the Treasury or Federal Reserve rather than use new budget money. It has not moved far in Congress. Still, US President Donald Trump issued an order on March 6, 2025, to set up a Bitcoin reserve plus a digital asset stockpile for other coins. He said the government would use assets seized in civil and criminal actions to start the fund. That means some 200,000 BTC the government already has could be part of it. Lummis Sees Bitcoin Price Rising In The Next Decade Lummis unveiled a proprietary model forecasting a dramatic rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price over the next decade, citing factors such as its fixed supply, growing institutional adoption, and expanding network effects. Analysts caution that such long-term forecasts hinge on unpredictable factors like regulatory shifts, technological breakthroughs, and market sentiment, any of which could derail even the most optimistic projections. She also praised Trump for pushing simple rules for crypto and for using digital coins as part of national strategy. Trump\u2019s family runs a DeFi platform, a stablecoin project, and even some meme coins. Lummis thinks everyone will end up in the crypto economy sooner or later. Related Reading: $500M Bet On Solana: Education Platform Aims To Supercharge Its Treasury Skeptic Voices And Uncertain Path Jamie Dimon disagrees. He calls the Bitcoin reserve a waste of resources.

Some economists at top universities give zero support to borrowing money to build a crypto stash. They argue it doesn\u2019t make sense against the US\u2019s nearly $36 trillion national debt.
