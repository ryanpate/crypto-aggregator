Related Reading: ONDO To Repeat 2024\u2019s \u2018Parabolic\u2019 Run? Analyst Anticipates 130% Rally Soon Bitcoin to Continue Choppy Performance On Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin dropped 5.5% to the $102,000 support fueled by the news of the Iran-Israel conflict. Amid the market pullback, the flagship crypto failed to hold its $108,000-$110,000 three-day range, falling to the mid-zone of its post-November breakout range. Notably, BTC had just recovered from last week\u2019s retest of the $100,000 level, reclaiming the key $106,800 area as support earlier this week. Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency \u201csaw a clear trigger on that retest of the range high,\u201d driven by the headlines of the Middle East turmoil, as it is \u201cstill quite a volatile and headline-driven market currently.\u201d Bitcoin took the liquidity above and below its local price range, the analyst explained, adding that it is \u201calready starting to trade more like the choppy (pre) summer environment\u201d he had forecasted. Despite the drop, the analyst highlighted that the range high remains the key level for a larger move up: I think the range high is a key area for the Bulls to hold on to. If not, I think there&#8217;s a case to be made for a local high to be put in and for the market to move back further within this range. At this point, I&#8217;m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possibly beyond). However, he suggested investors be cautious until BTC price breaks back above the range high convincingly and holds it as support on the higher timeframes. \u201cDon&#8217;t chop yourself up in the next few weeks/months,\u201d he warned. Volatility Could Send BTC To Range Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted a potential double top pattern forming on BTC\u2019s 4H chart, noting that if the price didn\u2019t bounce from the previous descending resistance, reclaimed a week ago, it could further drop into the mid-zone of its range. According to the analysis, if it loses the mid-range, BTC could risk a retest of the range lows, around the $90,000-$92,000 area. Similarly, market watcher Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin could fill the lower CME gaps if the war narrative intensifies. BTC opened two CME gaps between the end of April and the start of May, situated at the $92,500 and $97,300 levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the trader considers that this could serve as a discount entry for investors, as BTC \u201calready left higher CME gaps open,\u201d signaling that a rebound to the levels is likely. Moreover, he noted that Bitcoin is displaying the same structure as last year, which could hint at a massive rally brewing. In 2024, the cryptocurrency faced rejection from a multi-month descending resistance following its all-time high (ATH) rally, which set the Range high level.

      "summary": "Data shows the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen weekly inflows five times the recent average, while Bitcoin has seen a slowdown in momentum. Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Seen 154,000 ETH In Inflows This Week In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow related to the US-based Ethereum spot ETFs. The &#8220;spot ETFs&#8221; refer to investment vehicles that allow an alternate means of exposure to a given asset. This means that with a spot ETF, a trader can &#8216;invest&#8217; into an asset without having to directly own it. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this is especially relevant, as the ETFs trade on traditional platforms. Some investors may not want to fiddle with digital asset exchanges and wallets, so the ETFs offer them a familiar path into cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals The option of the spot ETFs is a relatively recent one in the sector, with Bitcoin&#8217;s version gaining approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and Ethereum&#8217;s in mid-2024. Below is a chart that shows how the netflows related to the latter&#8217;s spot ETFs have looked during the past month. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Ethereum US spot ETFs have been witnessing net inflows for the last few weeks, a sign that there has been demand for the coin from the traditional investors. &#8220;This week alone, they\u2019ve seen 154K ETH in inflows &#8211; 5x higher than their recent weekly average,&#8221; notes Glassnode. &#8220;For context: the biggest single-day ETH inflow this month was 77K ETH on June 11th.&#8221; While the trend has been that of growth for Ethereum, it has looked a bit more mixed when it comes to the number one digital asset, Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin US spot ETFs have also seen positive netflows this week. The scale of the inflows, however, hasn&#8217;t been anything impressive, as only around 7,800 BTC has entered into the ETFs. This is above average, but far lower than the highs witnessed in May, when at one point the daily inflow had reached a peak of 7,900 BTC, more than the inflows for the entire current week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet\u2014But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos Last week, the Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed an outright negative netflow, so it seems the momentum has recently just been slower for the asset. In contrast, things have looked much more green for Ethereum indeed.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally appears to have paused as the asset declined to just above $104,000 following a 2.1% drop over the past 24 hours. This latest movement signals a potential shift in short-term market momentum, with traders increasingly opting to exit positions. While the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced similar pullbacks, Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory is attracting closer scrutiny due to its influence on overall sentiment and market structure. Analysts are looking into how external factors, particularly geopolitical developments, are impacting trading behavior. One such development is the reported military engagement between Israel and Iran on June 13, which triggered sell pressure across high-risk assets, including digital currencies. Amid these events, key metrics on Binance, particularly Net Taker Volume, are showing increased sell-side dominance, suggesting short-term volatility may continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside Binance Net Taker Volume Hits Multi-Week Low Amid Bitcoin Panic Selling According to on-chain analyst Amr Taha on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin\u2019s Net Taker Volume on Binance fell to -$197 million, the most negative reading since June 6. This metric, which compares aggressive selling to aggressive buying, indicates heightened urgency among traders to sell at market prices, bypassing limit orders. The seven-hour moving average (7HMA) has remained in negative territory since June 12, reinforcing the current downward pressure. Historically, such extremes in net taker volume have been linked to local price bottoms, as they often signal panic-induced capitulation by retail and overleveraged traders. Taha highlighted that a similar event occurred on June 6, followed by a 4% rebound in Bitcoin\u2019s price within 24 hours. The implication is that, while aggressive selling may signal weakness, it also presents conditions that have previously preceded price reversals. Geopolitical Shock Triggers Liquidation Cascade, May Signal Local Bottom Taha also pointed to the geopolitical backdrop, specifically the sudden escalation between Israel and Iran, as a major catalyst for recent market behavior. News of the strike led to a surge in liquidation activity, especially among long-leveraged positions. The correlation between the timing of the conflict and the spike in Binance sell volume suggests that traders are reacting to broader market uncertainty, contributing to downward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Flips Again And History Says A Rally Is Around The Corner Despite this, Taha still views these conditions as potentially bullish in the medium term. Heavy selling often flushes out weaker hands, creating opportunities for long-term holders or institutional participants to accumulate positions at lower prices. Taha suggests that while the short-term outlook remains volatile, the current setup resembles previous recovery phases, marked by contrarian buying and reduced selling pressure.

      "summary": "Brewing tensions between Israel and Iran have triggered global de-risking across risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). The top cryptocurrency by market cap is down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. That said, technical indicators still point toward a potential new all-time high (ATH) for BTC in the coming months. Bitcoin Tracing The ABCD Pattern According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, BTC appears to be following the ABCD pattern. The analyst noted that Bitcoin is currently trading within a wedge formation and could target as high as $137,000 if it breaks out. For the uninitiated, the ABCD pattern is a classic chart setup with four points and three legs &#8211; AB, BC, and CD &#8211; where AB and CD are typically equal in length, and BC serves as the retracement. It helps identify potential reversal zones and signals when a price move may be losing momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance \u2013 A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Several other technical indicators also point to a potential new ATH for BTC. For instance, crypto analyst Crypto Caesar shared the following 4-hour Bitcoin chart highlighting a bullish double bottom pattern that suggests BTC is primed for recovery. Fellow crypto commentator Jelle identified a cup and handle pattern on the daily BTC chart. Jelle shared the following chart showing that BTC has already formed the &#8220;cup&#8221; and is now beginning to shape the &#8220;handle,&#8221; which typically precedes a sharp upward move. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn the Trader pointed to the Hash Ribbons &#8211; an on-chain indicator historically associated with major rallies. Merlijn shared the following BTC daily chart, noting that the last four appearances of this signal preceded strong Bitcoin uptrends. To explain, Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that uses Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages (MA) to spot miner capitulation and recovery. A bullish signal appears when the short-term average crosses above the long-term one. Are BTC Bears Regaining Ground? Although BTC remains above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, some concerning signs are beginning to emerge. The cryptocurrency was recently rejected from the $110,000 resistance level again, giving bears temporary control. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed\u2014Next Stop: $170,000 Similarly, on-chain data shows that long-term holders are beginning to exit the Bitcoin market which retail investors are starting to join in. Such dynamics are typically observed during the late phase of a bull cycle. In parallel, short-term holders are showing signs of declining confidence in BTC, as reflected in recent on-chain activity. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $105,568, down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Featured image with Unsplash, charts from X and TradingView.com"
