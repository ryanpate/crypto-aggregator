      "summary": "The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is witnessing increased network activity, which is bullish for its native token\u2019s price. On-chain data also shows that whales are actively accumulating XRP, with the addresses holding one million coins recently reaching a new high. XRP Ledger Records Massive Growth In Past Week In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the XRP Ledger is showing signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The platform revealed that there are now over 2,700 whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP for the first time in the token\u2019s 12-year history. Related Reading: Is There A \u201cSecret XRP Ledger\u201d And Is The Price Really At $1,000? Additionally, Santiment stated that the number of active XRP addresses has averaged over 295,000 daily over the past week. This is notable as the normal daily average over the past three months was between 35,000 and 40,000. It is worth mentioning that the XRPL recorded some major developments last week. One is the launch of Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. This is expected to boost network activity given the increasing demand for stablecoins. Crypto analyst Moon Lambo predicted that this would increase the total value locked (TVL) on the network. He also noted how this was bullish for the XRP price, since users will need the token for every USDC transaction. Furthermore, Ondo Finance launched its tokenized US treasury fund (OUSG) on the XRP Ledger last week, which could have also contributed to the surge in network activity. The BlackRock-backed fund will be mintable and redeemable using the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, Guggenheim also recently partnered with Ripple to launch the first Digital Commercial Paper on the XRPL. Expert Predicts Price Rally Above $4 Amid the surge in network activity on the XRPL, crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the XRP price could rally above $4 and even reach as high as $8. He stated that the altcoin is holding a clear breakout and is getting ready for a major bullish continuation. Marks added that the targets are at $4.80 and $8, marking new all-time highs (ATHs) for XRP. Related Reading: These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $25-$75 In June \u2013 Analyst Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently alluded to a previous analysis in which he stated that the XRP price could make a decision within two weeks. The analyst is confident that the altcoin could rally to as high as $6 on this Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. He has also previously predicted that XRP would reach double digits in this market cycle. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price has again dropped below the $2.25 level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades had warned that the support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and $1.55 could be in play if the $2.25 level holds as resistance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Tron has captured renewed attention following a major development: its planned entry into public markets. Justin Sun, Tron&#8217;s founder, has reached a deal with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment (SRM.O), under which SRM will acquire Tron-related tokens, rebrand as Tron Inc., and appoint Sun as an adviser. This move marks a significant step in bridging the gap between blockchain projects and traditional finance, potentially making Tron one of the first major public blockchain entities. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching \u2013 Will History Repeat? Meanwhile, rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have sparked volatility across the broader crypto market, including Tron. Despite this uncertain macro environment, Tron\u2019s on-chain fundamentals remain strong. Top analyst Darkfost shared data showing that Tron\u2019s daily transaction volume has surged from 2.5 million in 2021 to over 9 million today. This exponential growth underscores a sharp rise in user activity and developer engagement across the network. The sustained increase in transaction volume also reflects growing confidence in Tron\u2019s infrastructure as a scalable and reliable alternative to other high-throughput blockchains. With both institutional exposure via SRM and strong on-chain growth, Tron finds itself at a pivotal moment in its evolution\u2014one that could reshape its trajectory in the months ahead. Tron Retraces After Public Listing Surge: Network Fundamentals Remain Strong Tron is currently trading around key demand levels after a sharp retrace from Monday\u2019s breakout rally. The surge\u2014triggered by the announcement that Tron would go public via a deal with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment\u2014briefly sent TRX up over 9%, generating widespread attention. However, escalating tensions between Israel and Iran have weighed on market sentiment, dragging the price back to pre-announcement levels. Despite short-term volatility, Tron\u2019s fundamentals continue to paint a bullish picture. According to Darkfost, the Tron blockchain has demonstrated strong and consistent growth since 2021. Daily transaction volumes have risen from 2.5 million to over 9 million, reflecting increasing adoption and sustained demand for its infrastructure. This activity surge signals heightened investor interest and developer confidence in the network. Yet, high volume alone doesn\u2019t guarantee quality. What sets Tron apart is its impressive transaction success rate, which has remained above 96% throughout this growth phase. This reliability counters criticisms often aimed at other high-throughput chains like Solana, where failed or spammy transactions can inflate metrics. Additionally, Tron\u2019s block production has remained stable and linear, showcasing its operational consistency. Even amid rising global transaction fees, Tron continues to attract usage, suggesting that users still view it as a cost-effective, scalable solution. This blend of high performance, strong demand, and network resilience positions Tron as one of the most technically mature blockchains in the current market cycle. If macro conditions stabilize, Tron\u2019s public listing and robust on-chain metrics could reignite bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions \u2013 Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack TRX Price Analysis: Key Support Levels Hold Tron (TRX) is currently trading at approximately $0.273, consolidating just above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which sits around $0.268. After a sharp spike on Monday that pushed the price toward $0.30 following the announcement of Tron going public, the price retraced back to pre-announcement levels amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Despite this pullback, TRX remains in a bullish structure on the daily chart. The 100-day and 200-day SMAs, currently around $0.252 and $0.253, respectively, continue to trend upward and act as solid dynamic support, confirming that the medium- to long-term trend remains intact. Volume surged on the breakout but has since cooled, which is expected during periods of consolidation. Technically, TRX is forming a higher low structure while staying within a broader uptrend that began in late March. As long as the price holds above the $0.268 support level, bulls may attempt another push toward $0.285 and potentially retest the recent high near $0.30. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues \u2013 Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance A break below $0.268 could invalidate the bullish momentum and trigger a move toward the $0.252\u2013$0.255 zone.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/8-xrp-breakout-brewing-sec-no-longer-a-roadblock-bullish-analyst-says/",
      "summary": "Interest is building among XRP investors after Crypto Beast, a well\u2011known analyst, put forward a bold forecast. He sees a minimum breakout level of $8 on the horizon. With the US Securities and Exchange Commission no longer posing a roadblock, Crypto Beast believes XRP has a clear path ahead. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence His view rests on the idea that the market still hasn\u2019t fully priced in XRP\u2019s cleared status with regulators. Short\u2011term traders and long\u2011term holders alike are tuning in. Regulatory Milestone And Market Reaction According to court records, XRP won a key victory in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that it\u2019s not a security under US law. That moment sent XRP from about $0.48 to $0.93 very fast. But prices slipped back over the next few weeks, bringing it down to the $0.50 area again. Then, after US President Donald Trump won re\u2011election and signaled a shake\u2011up at the SEC, XRP marched into a new range around $2.00. Despite that climb, Crypto Beast argues the legal win hasn\u2019t been fully valued by the wider market. XRP is about to explode. I\u2019m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn\u2019t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn\u2019t consider it a security.$XRP holders are about to PRINT. I\u2019ll drop the signal to exit right here when the moment is right. You\u2019ll regret not following. pic.twitter.com/oiE8INoy7F \u2014 Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 16, 2025 Technical Pattern Points To Upside Crypto Beast pointed to a bull flag chart pattern that starts with a rally from $0.40 up to $3.40. A flag pattern formed when XRP pulled back into the $2.00\u2013$3.00 zone. He marked the breakout level at $3.37. By measuring the height of that $3.00 pole and adding it to the low of the flag, he arrived at a target near $10.69. In another post, he set a more conservative floor of $8.80, a roughly 4x gain from today\u2019s price around $2.20. That kind of move would push XRP\u2019s market cap above $500 billion, putting it in league with big firms like Oracle, Netflix and Mastercard. Broader Crypto Trends And Correlation Based on reports from his channel, Crypto Beast isn\u2019t just upbeat on XRP price about to &#8220;explode&#8221;. He\u2019s looking for a 3x rise in Solana, a 2x pop in Ethereum and a 5x run in SUI. Even more, he\u2019s penciled in potential 40x gains for select smaller tokens. Still, these forecasts rest on a growing crypto mood\u2014mostly led by Bitcoin. When BTC stalls or dips, large altcoins often follow suit. So any rally in XRP may need fresh money flowing into the whole market. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Risks And Exit Strategy Crypto Beast says he\u2019ll flag when it\u2019s time to sell. He reminded followers that patterns do fail and charts alone can\u2019t guarantee gains. A sudden market shift or a change in macro sentiment could spoil the setup. He advises setting stop\u2011loss levels and watching BTC for hints. His trust in XRP\u2019s future is strong, but he wants traders to be ready for any twist.

      "title": "Is Ethereum Price Set To Repeat History As 2017 Playbook Returns? Why This Time Could Be Bigger",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-2017-playbook-returns/",
      "summary": "The Ethereum price action is showing remarkable similarities to its 2017 market cycle, with analysts pointing to a near-identical technical setup and market behaviour. Crypto analyst Merlijn the Trader, who shared a side-by-side weekly chart comparison of 2025 and 2017 on X (formerly Twitter), suggests that Ethereum is now following the same breakout pattern that once led to a historic rally. This time, however, the analyst believes that the move could be even more significant. Ethereum Price Mirrors Historic Breakout Pattern In the current 2025 chart, Ethereum has reportedly claimed the 50-week Moving Average (MA) after months of downward pressure and range-bound movement. Following a decisive breakout from support levels near $2,250, the price of the cryptocurrency is now consolidating below the 50 MA, forming a tight sideways pattern. Related Reading: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025 According to Merlijn the Trader, this structure is visually and technically similar to price movements that occurred in late 2016 and early 2017, just before Ethereum began a powerful upward surge. The analyst\u2019s 2017 Ethereum chart shows the altcoin breaking above the 50 MA, followed by a brief period of sideways action under resistance. Once momentum was built, the price launched into a parabolic rally that marked the beginning of its major bull cycle. Notably, the 2025 chart situated on the right panel displays an almost identical playbook to the 2017 setup, with Ethereum moving out of a prolonged accumulation phase and into a zone of consolidation beneath key resistance levels. However, this time, market conditions are significantly different. The analyst notes that the crypto space is far more developed, with increased institutional involvement, broader retail adoption, and growing infrastructure supporting Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. While the technical patterns align closely with the 2017 breakout, the scale and context suggest that the potential upside could even be greater. The similarities between Ethereum\u2019s 2017 and 2025 price action lie in the timing of the 50 MA reclaim and the tight range of consolidation that follows. If ETH can maintain this trajectory and break above the current resistance zone, it could mark the beginning of a fresh macro rally, which the analyst predicts will not just repeat history but possibly amplify it. Ethereum Eyes $4,000 As 2017 Pattern Repeats Based on Merlijn The Trader\u2019s comparable chart analysis, Ethereum may be on the verge of a major breakout, with technical patterns pointing to a potential price target above $4,000. In the 2017 setup, Ethereum skyrocketed past $28 from a low between $6 and $7.5 after reclaiming the 50 MA. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 Cycle? Here\u2019s The Target If history is any guide, Ethereum\u2019s next move could propel it from its current price of $2,541 to $4,000, which aligns with the upper red horizontal line on the 2025 price chart or above the line to fresh all-time highs, with no ceiling in sight, according to the analyst.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-pressure-builds/",
      "summary": "BNB finds itself at a pivotal moment as price action tightens between two critical technical zones. After a period of consolidation, the cryptocurrency is testing resistance near the 200-period moving average, hovering around the $653 mark. Meanwhile, support around the $640 level continues to hold firm, acting as a safety net for bulls trying to defend the current structure. 200 MA Acts As A Ceiling Against BNB Uptrend According to Thomas Anderson in a recent X post, the M15 BNB chart reveals that the price is currently testing resistance around the $651.50 level, marked by a horizontal yellow line. Related Reading: BNB Coils For Impact: Will $670 Crack Under Pressure? This move follows a recent bounce off the ascending white trendline support, indicating that buyers are still defending the short-term uptrend. However, price action remains just beneath the 200-period moving average (red line), which is acting as a dynamic resistance zone near the $653 mark. Momentum indicators are offering mixed signals at the moment. The MACD continues to print negative values, showing that bearish pressure hasn\u2019t fully dissipated, while the RSI has started recovering from previously oversold conditions. This combination suggests the potential for a short-term bounce within the ascending channel. M30 And H1 Charts Are Aligning In an updated post, the analyst also went further to examine the BNB M30 chart, where price is currently trading at $650.10 and appears to be consolidating just below the 200-period moving average (red line) situated around the $653 level. This area is acting as a key short-term resistance zone, and price action has shown hesitation around it, reflecting a battle between buyers and sellers. Interestingly, the H1 chart mirrors this behavior, showing a broader ascending channel structure that suggests an underlying bullish bias, though still unconfirmed. Related Reading: BNB Price Reclaims $600 \u2014 Is This the Start of a Major Upside Move? The immediate resistance to watch remains near the $653 mark, aligned with the 200 MA on both the M30 and H1 timeframes. If bulls can muster enough strength to break and sustain above this level, it could trigger a fresh wave of upward momentum for BNB toward the next resistance at $657. This would represent a potential continuation of the ascending channel&#8217;s structure and hint at growing bullish control in the short term. On the flip side, if price fails to push above the $653 resistance, consolidation may begin to lose steam. In such a scenario, a retreat toward the previous swing low near the $640 level becomes likely. This support area has already proven its strength and could be the next level of defense if bearish pressure increases. Traders are watching closely, as these levels may determine BNB&#8217;s next directional move. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"
