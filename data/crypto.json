      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/why-bitcoin-calm-rally-could-be-a-setup-for-a-massive-breakout-analyst-reveals/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has returned to an upward trajectory, with the asset posting a 1.7% gain in the last 24 hours to reach $109,505. This marks a 4% increase in the past week, placing the cryptocurrency less than 2% below its all-time high of $111,000 set last month. The move follows a period of subdued market activity, with recent gains occurring in a relatively quiet trading environment. Analysts have looked into on-chain indicators for signals of whether the current price action is sustainable or approaching overheated levels. Particularly, unlike previous rallies driven by sharp price spikes and speculative retail demand, the latest growth appears more measured. This has prompted the assessment of metrics such as Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), MVRV ratio, and exchange premium indexes to gauge underlying investor behavior and sentiment. Related Reading: BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Becomes Fastest Ever To Reach $70 Billion AUM Bitcoin Long-Term Holders and US Demand Drive Quiet Accumulation According to an analysis published on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform by contributor Avocado Onchain, Bitcoin\u2019s current rally is taking shape under relatively stable conditions. The analyst points to a declining 30-day moving average of Binary CDD, a metric that tracks the spending behavior of long-term holders. The decrease suggests that these holders are not yet exiting the market, indicating a continued confidence in the asset\u2019s potential for further gains. Another notable indicator cited in the analysis is the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the difference between Bitcoin prices on US-based Coinbase and other global exchanges. This premium is increasing and nearing levels observed during Bitcoin\u2019s prior peaks in March and December 2024. While elevated premiums can be a warning sign of overheating, Avocado notes that the Korea Premium Index remains low, suggesting muted activity from retail traders in Asia. This balance implies that institutional buying pressure, particularly from US-based investors, could be driving the recent momentum. In addition, the MVRV ratio, a comparison of Bitcoin\u2019s market value to its realized value, has been rising gradually without any sharp jumps. This suggests that the market has not entered an extreme greed phase, further reinforcing the idea that the current uptrend may have more room to run. Avocado wrote: In summary, rather than anticipating a correction, the current indicators suggest that Bitcoin may have further room to grow, and this could be a time to carefully monitor the potential for continued upside. Whale Activity and Institutional Inflows Signal Market Confidence In a separate post, another CryptoQuant contributor known as Crypto Dan highlighted consistent buying activity from larger market players. His report notes that the Coinbase Premium has been climbing steadily since April 21, indicating increased demand from US investors. This trend, combined with observations of whale accumulation, points to a strengthening market foundation despite the absence of exuberant price behavior. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here The analyst further noted that such patterns are characteristic of post-correction recovery phases in Bitcoin\u2019s historical price cycles. So far, the combination of long-term holder conviction, institutional demand, and subdued retail activity suggests the rally may be advancing on more stable footing than prior surges.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-charts-rare-signal-not-seen-in-years/",
      "summary": "In his latest macro-technical analysis, crypto strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) has flagged a potentially pivotal moment for Ethereum (ETH), arguing that a confluence of rare monthly chart signals\u2014some not seen in years\u2014could be laying the groundwork for durable altcoin outperformance. Speaking in a video posted June 9, the analyst described the current Ethereum setup across multiple timeframes as \u201csomething we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d drawing comparisons to historical signals that preceded major rallies in 2016, 2018, and 2020. Ethereum Primed For Macro Breakout Kevin emphasized that Ethereum now exhibits strong bullish momentum across its USD pair, dominance chart, and ETH/BTC ratio, pointing to a simultaneous alignment of several high-time frame indicators. \u201cThese are things that just don\u2019t pop up every day,\u201d he said. \u201cMatter of fact, these are things that have almost never popped up in such confluence throughout history for Ethereum.\u201d The core of Kevin\u2019s thesis hinges on what he calls a \u201cmonthly demand candle\u201d\u2014a large, typically green candlestick that emerges after a protracted correction. Ethereum printed such a candle in May 2025 following nearly a year of sideways chop and five months of drawdown. Historically, these demand candles have marked the start of significant uptrends. Kevin cited analogous structures in 2016, 2018, and during the COVID-19 crash in 2020, all of which preceded multi-month rallies. \u201cThis may be the most textbook demand candle we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he noted, adding that \u201cthe last time we saw something like this was before ETH ran for nearly a year with barely any major correction.\u201d Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Supporting the candle analysis is a synchronized bullish turn in several technical indicators. The Market Cipher momentum wave has clipped into the oversold zone and printed a confirmed green dot buy signal. Simultaneously, the VWAP\u2014volume-weighted average price\u2014has crossed above the zero line, and money flow has started to trend upward. Kevin was explicit about the importance of this configuration: \u201cLet me tell you something: this is a big deal.\u201d The monthly RSI, currently sitting at 51, has not yet broken the crucial 70-level that historically marks the onset of parabolic price action. According to Kevin, \u201cETH has never even broken 70 this cycle. You haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s possible yet for Ethereum\u2014or for altcoins in general. You\u2019ve seen nothing yet.\u201d He also highlighted the return of whale accumulation, measured through a proprietary \u201cwhale money flow\u201d indicator. After exiting ETH positions for over a year\u2014from March 2024 to May 2025\u2014whale flows have shown a V-shaped bottom and are now turning up. \u201cWe are now starting to see accumulation durably here,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cYou keep hearing that BlackRock&#8217;s buying ETH, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s reflected in this indicator, but we are definitely seeing whale activity occur on the monthly time frame.\u201d The analyst went further, showing that Ethereum\u2019s stock RSI on the monthly timeframe has not only bottomed out but is now rebounding sharply\u2014a pattern that historically precedes long-duration uptrends. \u201cThis is aggressive movement,\u201d he explained, noting that for confirmation, the RSI still needs to cross the 20-level, but emphasized that the current shape of the rebound is stronger than in previous cycles. Ethereum Shows Relative Strength Another key piece of the puzzle is Ethereum\u2019s dominance chart, which tracks ETH\u2019s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto space excluding Bitcoin. Kevin pointed to a potential double bottom on the monthly chart and a newly confirmed MACD momentum shift, the first in over two years. \u201cThat\u2019s two years and one month of downtrend finally reversing,\u201d he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds \u2013 Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Finally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing a near-identical structure to Ethereum\u2019s dominance chart. Kevin believes this confluence is key. \u201cLook at that\u2014wow, that\u2019s funny\u2014it looks the same. You find your major low right where you found it in 2020. The monthly indicators are all curling up.\u201d Still, he remained measured in his optimism, noting that macroeconomic conditions\u2014particularly monetary policy\u2014remain essential for confirming the bullish case. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some monetary policy shifting. We still need inflation to come in line. But the market is living four to six months ahead. If the market starts to sniff out that easing is coming, we\u2019ll see that reflected in asset prices before it happens.\u201d Referencing cycle theory and historical post-halving performance, Kevin argued that ETH\u2019s recent relative strength fits both narratives. \u201cTypically, ETH and altcoins start to outperform Bitcoin in"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/toncoin-ton-toward-40-breakout-pattern-suggest/",
      "summary": "An analyst has pointed out how Toncoin (TON) is currently trading inside a Triangle pattern that could potentially set the stage up for a 40% move. Toncoin Has Been Stuck Inside A Triangle On The Daily Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that Toncoin has recently been moving inside. The pattern in question is a Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which forms when an asset&#8217;s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. Three popular ones include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines relative to each other defines which type a particular triangular channel falls under. In an Ascending Triangle, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, its consolidation shrinks toward a net upside. The Descending Triangle involves just the opposite case; the upper line is sloped downward while the lower one is flat. The third variation, the Symmetrical Triangle, has its trendlines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In this pattern, the price&#8217;s range tightens to a point in a sideways manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle pattern that Toncoin has seemingly been trapped within during the past few months: From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Triangle that the 1-day price of Toncoin has been following looks similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it&#8217;s not a perfect one; there is a slight bias to the downside. The cryptocurrency most recently found support at the lower line and has since climbed toward the midway point between the trendlines. The coin&#8217;s price is now not too far from the apex of the pattern. Generally, breakouts become more likely as consolidation becomes tighter, so it&#8217;s possible that TON may be approaching one. According to the analyst, a breakout, if it happens, could potentially end up leading to a 40% move for Toncoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Diverge\u2014ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative As for which direction a breakout might take the asset in, Symmetrical Triangles usually have both sides at equal probability. Since the Triangle in the current case is slightly angled down, however, an exit below the lower line may be a bit more likely. It now remains to be seen how Toncoin&#8217;s price will develop in the coming days and if the pattern will play any role. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.3, up over 2% in the last seven days. Featured image from Shutterstock.com, charts from TradingView.com"
