      "summary": "As the official public sale of Pump.fun\u2019s token approaches, significant activity has emerged across decentralized derivatives exchanges, where large investors appear to be managing risk by taking early positions. Market data shows that whales are interacting with pre-market perpetual contracts, particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid and Binance, as they anticipate potential volatility during the token\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO), scheduled for July 12. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds \u2013 Details Perpetual Market Signals Whale Hedging Strategy Three prominent wallets have collectively deposited over $11 million in USDC on Hyperliquid to open short positions on the newly listed PUMP perpetual contract. These trades appear to function as hedges against anticipated allocations in the upcoming token generation event. According to on-chain tracker Lookonchain and explorer Hypurrscan, the structure of these positions, utilizing low leverage and modest open interest compared to margin collateral, suggests a defensive rather than speculative stance. One wallet, identified as \u201c0xAc72,\u201d allocated $4 million in margin and opened a 2x leveraged short valued at approximately $1.07 million at an entry price of $0.00504. This trader\u2019s liquidation point sits at $0.02138, offering a wide buffer that implies the position is less about profit from a downturn and more about offsetting potential downside risk from PUMP exposure in the ICO. Two additional wallets deployed a combined $7 million in margin to open 1x leveraged shorts. Together, these positions amount to roughly $2.39 million in open interest, a small portion of their posted collateral. Hyperliquid\u2019s open interest in PUMP has surpassed $43 million since listing the token in the early hours of Thursday\u2019s European session. Binance followed suit by listing a PUMP perpetual contract, which quickly amassed over $12 billion in trading volume, indicating heightened market anticipation. It is worth noting that the early trading could serve multiple purposes, including valuation locking by whales, arbitrage strategies related to expected airdrops, or speculative profit-taking based on retail momentum. Pump.fun Token Launch Nears as Pricing Premium Narrows The PUMP token initially debuted in pre-market trading at a roughly 40% premium to its ICO price of $0.004. It reached a high of $0.0056 on Hyperliquid before retreating to around $0.0047 levels, a level closer to its public sale valuation. The narrowing premium suggests a recalibration in investor expectations as trading stabilizes ahead of the launch. Pump.fun, a meme-coin launchpad built on Solana, announced the token in June alongside a revenue-sharing initiative for token holders. The token has a total supply of 1 trillion, with 33% allocated to early participants via a private sale (18%) and public sale (15%). The ICO will run from July 12 to July 15 on crypto exchange Bybit, providing a limited window for broader participation.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-jump-off-critical-support-level-relief-or-reversal/",
      "summary": "Altcoins have endured years of underperformance as Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market. Despite several short-lived rallies, most altcoins remain far below their previous highs, weighed down by investor skepticism and capital concentration in BTC. However, there are signs that sentiment might be shifting. In recent days, strong altcoins have started to recover, showing resilience as broader market conditions improve. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical setup revealing that the altcoin market is now bouncing off a major support zone. This move has sparked fresh debates among traders and investors. Is this the start of a long-awaited altseason, or merely a temporary relief bounce before further downside? The bounce comes as macroeconomic uncertainty begins to fade and liquidity returns to the crypto market. Still, key resistance levels remain untouched for many projects, and overall confidence in altcoins hasn\u2019t fully returned. While the current setup is promising, confirmation will depend on whether this rally can break above critical levels and sustain higher prices. Altcoins Eye A Breakout As Ethereum Holds The Key Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but sentiment is beginning to shift. Bulls are preparing for an expansive move across the board, with growing anticipation that a breakout could materialize once Ethereum clears its current resistance zone. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a well-defined consolidation range, and altcoins have mirrored this sideways behavior, struggling to gain momentum without a clear signal from the market\u2019s second-largest asset. Carl Runefelt recently shared insights suggesting that the altcoin market is showing signs of life. By analyzing the TOTAL3 chart\u2014which tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014Runefelt highlights that altcoins are bouncing off key support in BTC terms. This bounce could indicate the beginning of a recovery rally, especially if capital rotation from BTC into altcoins accelerates in the coming sessions. Historically, altcoins thrive when Ethereum leads the charge. A confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance zone could ignite broad participation and kickstart a new altseason. The current market structure suggests that many investors are positioning early, anticipating that macroeconomic clarity and market stability will fuel risk-on behavior. However, the rally is not yet confirmed. Bulls still need Ethereum to break out decisively and sustain momentum above recent highs. If that happens, many oversold altcoins could see sharp recoveries and set the stage for a broader market expansion. For now, patience and timing remain key as traders watch ETH and TOTAL3 closely for signals of the next leg up. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves TOTAL3 Chart Shows Key Rebound From Macro Support The TOTAL3 chart, which measures the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is showing early signs of recovery after a sustained period of weakness. As of now, the chart reflects a bounce from the $830 billion level, which aligns closely with the 100-week simple moving average (SMA), currently acting as dynamic support. This level has historically served as a critical pivot zone, especially in mid-cycle consolidations. The market cap sits near $875 billion, still over 40% below the previous cycle\u2019s peak, but with bullish momentum building. The recent weekly candle has posted a strong green body, suggesting renewed interest in the altcoin segment. Volume has also picked up, showing growing confidence among participants as many altcoins recover from deeply oversold conditions. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise Technically, this bounce could signal the beginning of a new macro leg higher, especially if the 50-week SMA is reclaimed and price holds above $900 billion. The overall structure remains constructive, with higher lows forming since late 2022 and price compressing into a potential breakout formation. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
