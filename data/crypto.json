      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s price roller-coaster has drawn a dramatic wager from big players. While many smaller traders are bracing for more losses, a handful of massive accounts have broken the surface and put millions in a massive show of force. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Ethereum Whale Bets Surface According to on-chain data, one whale opened a long position worth $101 million at an entry price of $2,247, using 25x leverage. That bet paid off with roughly $950,000 in profit, but it also cost $2.5 million in fees. These numbers show just how high the stakes have become. High Fees Cut Into Gains This whale further withdrew 18,000 $ETH worth $40.38M from #Binance. Now, the whale holds 50,256 $ETH worth $112.62M, currently down $2.24M Address: 0x3952d69643f7a87237c7fc8bb33f8453c0b45500 https://t.co/49vC0iqMZP pic.twitter.com/rF5cX2gsXZ \u2014 Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 23, 2025 Based on reports from On-Chain Lens, another whale moved over $40 million in Ether from Binance before opening its own leveraged trade. Combine the two wallets and you\u2019ve got about $112 million riding on an ETH bounce. Yet those $2.5 million in fees highlight the hidden cost of big bets. Middle East Tension Hits Prices ETH slipped to about $2,113 on Sunday, marking its lowest level in 30 days. That drop came after US military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. United States President Donald Trump called the operation a \u201cspectacular success\u201d and warned of more action if Iran didn\u2019t back down. Traders say the fallout from those strikes rattled global markets and fed crypto volatility. Retail Traders Watch Closely Retail traders tend to sell when prices drop. But these whales have the scope to weather downswings. Their large purchases indicate that they find value at current levels. Short traders might not agree, however. They&#8217;re sitting in many short positions, expecting ETH to decline further before it will rise. What The Whales See Experts say large holders tend to have lower break-even points. They can afford to wait months or years for a payoff. Some also use complex strategies across multiple markets. That makes their moves hard to read from the outside. Still, when you see $112 million on the line, it\u2019s a hint that smart money senses a buying window. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Risks On Both Sides Leveraged trades amplify gains and losses equally. A 5% drop would trigger a forced sell-off on a 25x position. That could feed a sharp decline in ETH\u2019s price. On the other hand, if the market turns up, those whales could pocket big returns well beyond what retail traders see. Investors will be watching every market swing. If geopolitical tensions cool and big money stays bullish, ETH could find footing above $2,200. But another shock\u2014political or technical\u2014might send the price tumbling again.

      "summary": "The cryptocurrency market\u2019s sharp retracement may be approaching its denouement, according to prominent trader and YouTuber CryptoInsightUK, who told his followers on 23 June that XRP is \u201creally flipping close\u201d to completing the final leg of a corrective structure that began in early April. Final Trap Or Final Chance For XRP? In his latest video analysis, the analyst sketched a scenario in which Bitcoin grinds lower toward the $92,000\u2013$95,000 liquidity pocket \u201cto sweep the last standing bids,\u201d dragging major altcoins with it. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the extra bit of flush down that we were talking about and looking for,\u201d he said, noting that Bitcoin already wicked to $98,200 but has yet to produce the higher-low/higher-high sequence or the bullish RSI divergence that stamped the April capitulation bottom. \u201cI think we\u2019re close to a bottom. I don\u2019t quite think we\u2019re there.\u201d Related Reading: XRP To $30 Beyond 2026? Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch XRP, he argues, is tracing the same pattern at a different scale. The 4-hour chart shows a conspicuous liquidity shelf at $1.89 and a deeper block stretching to $1.73. \u201cIn a world where Bitcoin does get the flush to ninety,\u201d he observed, \u201ccould we come and take that? Yes. \u2026 Maybe $1.85, potentially on a wick.\u201d Although he concedes a tail-risk dip toward $1.60\u2013$1.55, that move is \u201cnot my base case.\u201d What makes the area compelling, in CryptoInsightUK\u2019s view, is the clustering of spot demand on each successive stab lower. He highlighted the \u201cbig red bar\u201d of sell-side volume that marked last week\u2019s sweep and the immediate spike in spot bids, calling it evidence of \u201creal accumulation rather than derivative games.\u201d Funding rates across major venues have turned modestly positive, confirming that \u201cpeople are going long,\u201d a dynamic that could yet trigger one more liquidity vacuum as over-leveraged latecomers are forced out. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk Of 20% Crash To $1.55 If This Level Fails To Hold Springboard For $11 XRP? Technically, the trader is watching for a textbook bullish divergence: price carves a marginally lower low while the 4-hour RSI prints a higher one, mirroring the set-up that preceded April\u2019s 140% rally. The fixed-range volume profile on Bitcoin\u2014where the point of control sits near $97,000\u2014offers confluence, suggesting the broader market is attempting to base on a major support shelf before rotation into altcoins. If that pattern holds, CryptoInsightUK believes XRP is positioned for a \u201cdrastic\u201d expansionary phase that would lift the token first to the oft-cited $8 target and then, in an over-extension, to \u201crealistically $11 to $12.\u201d From an idealised $1.85 entry the projection implies an upside of roughly 475%. \u201cI put my neck on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s thinking eight. I think we over-extend that a little bit.\u201d The analyst\u2019s conviction rests in part on his read of Bitcoin dominance, now hovering in what he calls the \u201creversal box.\u201d A final push to the upper edge could spark the long-awaited altseason, he argued, with XRP\u2014as a large-cap, high-beta play\u2014capturing disproportionate flows once Bitcoin volatility subsides.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/cme-gap-at-92000-is-a-12-retrace-inevitable-for-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin market has been marked by notable volatility recently, with prices fluctuating significantly, dropping close to the $98,400 level before rebounding above $105,000 on Monday. Potential 12% Retrace To $92,000 Technical analyst Doctor Profit recently shared key notes on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), indicating that a substantial Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap exists at $92,000. The analyst predicts that this level will likely be eventually reached, suggesting that closing this gap could create additional fear in the market, which often plays into the hands of market makers. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target Doctor Profit also highlighted in his analysis the presence of significant liquidity in that area, making it a probable target for Bitcoin in the near term. This could potentially mean a 12% retrace of BTC\u2019s price. Doctor Profit also pointed to several technical indicators that suggest a bearish trend for Bitcoin. He highlighted the Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) crossing on the daily chart and the breakdown of the critical $104,000 level. Additionally, the analyst mentioned the temporary loss of what he calls the &#8220;golden line,&#8221; which is currently situated around $103,000 for BTC, another key level to watch in order to accomplish further recoveries. Doctor Profit warned that caution is necessary, especially near pivotal levels like $100,000 and the CME gap at $92,000. He even posited that a worst-case scenario could see Bitcoin correcting all the way down to the $82,000\u2013$84,000 range. Bitcoin Fate Hangs On Golden Line Doctor Profit further elaborated that the situation hinges on the golden line, which serves as a critical retest to confirm the breakdown that occurred yesterday. For Bitcoin to secure a bullish continuation, it needs to close above this level. Moreover, he identified a significant liquidity cluster around the $113,000 mark, noting that this area is rife with short liquidations. Should Bitcoin consolidate above the golden line, the uncertainty that has plagued traders could dissipate, allowing for a shift from protective strategies back to a more bullish outlook. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk Of 20% Crash To $1.55 If This Level Fails To Hold In his analysis, Doctor Profit concluded by stating that while he initially expected Bitcoin to reach $90,000 before any new all-time highs (ATH), the resolution of current market uncertainty indicates that this may no longer be necessary. With the war between Israel and Iran, along with the volatility seemingly over, he believes Bitcoin can accelerate toward new all-time highs without the need to revisit the $90,000 mark. When writing, BTC trades at $105,560, recording a 3% price surge in the 24-hour time frame. At this level, the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency trails 5.3% below its record high of $111,800.

      "summary": "Data shows the rebound in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has punished the bears, triggering a massive wave of short liquidations. Crypto Sector Has Just Witnessed A Mass Liquidation Event According to data from CoinGlass, a large amount of liquidations have piled up on the cryptocurrency derivatives market. &#8220;Liquidation&#8221; refers to the forceful shutdown that any open contract has to go through if its losses exceed the threshold defined by its platform. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Zone Could Be Market\u2019s Next True \u2018Pivot,\u2019 Says Glassnode Below is a table that shows the numbers related to the latest liquidations in the market. As displayed, the cryptocurrency sector has seen a derivatives flush of over half a billion dollars during the past day. Out of these, 73.7% of the liquidations, equivalent to $371 million, came from the short investors alone. The short-heavy mass liquidations have come as Bitcoin and company have rebounded following the news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Earlier, US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had induced a crash in the market that ended up unleashing a flurry of long liquidations. This time, it seems the bears have been the ones caught out instead. As usual, Bitcoin and Ethereum have topped the list of liquidations, but interestingly, the latter ($168 million) has managed to outweigh the former ($153 million), which is generally not the case. Ethereum observing a higher amount of liquidations could come down to the fact that its price has seen a larger jump during the past day (7% vs 3.5%). It could also be an indication of an elevated level of speculative interest in the cryptocurrency. Out of the altcoins, Solana and XRP have topped the charts with $29 million and $13 million in liquidations, respectively. Though clearly, these numbers are quite small compared to the figures of the top two titans, showcasing the sheer difference in capital involved. In some other news, Bitcoin taker buy volume has shot up on the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. In the chart, the data of the Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio is shown. This metric measures the ratio between the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a given platform. Here, the exchange involved is Bybit. Related Reading: Bitcoin STHs Capitulate: 14,700 BTC Moved To Exchanges At Loss It would appear that the indicator has recently seen a sharp spike above the 1 mark, a sign that long volume has started to sharply outpace the short one. According to the quant, spikes in the metric on Bybit have often preceded a surge in the BTC price.

      "title": "Analyst Says XRP Is Moving According To Plan, Here\u2019s Why $1.90 Is Important",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-moving-according-to-plan/",
      "summary": "A crypto analyst has reaffirmed a bullish outlook for XRP, suggesting that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price action is unfolding exactly as anticipated. The analyst points out that XRP is now approaching the critical support level at $1.90, which could signal a potential bullish reversal if the price manages to hold above it. XRP Eyes $1.90 As Key Reversal Zone Crypto market expert CasiTrades believes that the XRP price behavior is moving exactly as predicted following its recent price drop below $2. According to the chart and analysis published on X (formerly Twitter), XRP\u2019s retracement toward the $1.90 region is not a sign of weakness but a textbook setup for a potential reversal. Related Reading: Daily Timeframe Says XRP Price Is On The Verge Of Breakout The $1.90 level represents a major Fibonacci Retracement zone, specifically the 0.5 retracement from the macro correction, which the analyst has been closely watching for a possible price reaction. According to CasiTrades, this zone is more than just a random support level\u2014it aligns with a pattern that the analyst described in earlier updates. In these previous reports, CasiTrades was watching out for distinct price movements during XRP\u2019s decline, including a bounce off a key Fibonacci level, a short-term fakeout upward to trap late buyers, and a final drop back into the support zone, where Bullish Divergence can develop. This distinct price pattern now appears to be playing out exactly as expected on the XRP price chart. If XRP holds above the $1.90 level while forming a Bullish Divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), it could confirm a textbook bottom setup and potentially signal the start of a new impulsive rally. XRP And Bitcoin Display Synchronized Patterns CasiTrades&#8217; price chart shows XRP forming a Descending Triangle, with its latest move dipping just into a high-demand zone marked by previous price reactions. In line with the Elliott Wave Theory, this pattern suggests the upcoming completion of Wave 2 with a massive breakout in Wave 3 potentially taking shape if the $1.90 support level holds. Additional support from key Fibonacci levels, such as the 0.618 and 2.136 extensions at $2.0 and $2.1, respectively, reinforces strength in XRP\u2019s potential for a rebound. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Perfect Setup After Buy Retest \u2013 Next Stop $3.7 Interestingly, the analyst points to the Bitcoin price action mirroring this exact behavior\u2014bouncing from just under its own 0.236 retracement near $97,000, and potentially setting up for a final dip into support. This synchronized structure across both XRP and BTC adds heavy confluence. CasiTrades notes that this current downturn is not a breakdown, but rather a final calculated shakeout before a broader rally. If both Bitcoin and XRP reach as expected while positioned at $0.19 and $97,000 respectively, the analyst believes it could trigger a new bullish leg in the crypto cycle.
