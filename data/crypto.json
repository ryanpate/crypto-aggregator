      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/california-state-to-accept-crypto-top-presales-to-pump/",
      "summary": "California embraces its techie heart and opens the door for crypto payments. That\u2019s probably not surprising for the state that hosts Coinbase, Kraken, and other big-name crypto companies. And with obvious support from those organizations, it\u2019s probably even less surprising that the California assembly passed the upcoming crypto payments bill, AB 1180, unanimously, 68-0. The move allows the state government to accept crypto payments \u2013 including Bitcoin \u2013 for certain obligations. If it passes the state senate, there\u2019d be a trial program from 2026-2031, followed by full adoption. California Cements Spot Among Top World Economies It\u2019s a big deal because California boasts the 4th-largest economy in the world, with $4.1T nominal GDP. That\u2019s right \u2013 if it were a country, California would rank just behind the US, China, and Germany, and just ahead of Japan. And \u2013 partially fueled by crypto growth in the form of Kraken, Coinbase, et al \u2013 California can also point to an economic growth rate that outpaces the other top economies. California\u2019s growing at 6% year-over-year, with an average growth rate of 7.5% from 2021-2024. In other words, this isn\u2019t Colorado ($550B) or Louisiana ($327B), two other states that have similar rules in place. It\u2019s not even Florida ($1.7T), which also is moving to accept crypto. California is one of the largest economies in the world, the largest state economy in the US, and if the bill passes, it\u2019ll take card, cash, and crypto. AB 1180 Payments Bill Supports Upcoming Bitcoin Bill While AB 1180 focuses on the government side, another bill \u2013 AB 1052 \u2013 does something similar for private payments. Specifically, AB 1052 establishes clearly that crypto payments are acceptable means of settling private debts. It supports a self-custody regulatory structure, while also opening the door for a state digital assets reserve formed of unclaimed assets. Together, AB 1052 and AB 1180 show California&#8217;s going \u2018all-in\u2019 on crypto. Another major global economic player bites the dust, bowing before crypto\u2019s relentless rise. Adopting crypto payments for both private and public organizations will require a top-notch, easy-to-learn crypto wallet. That\u2019s where Best Wallet app and the Best Wallet Token come in. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 Supercharge Leading Web3 Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers up the already-impressive performance of the Best Wallet app. The app delivers a secure, reliable self-custody Web3 wallet, with biometric security and support for dozens of blockchains. It\u2019s also the first crypto wallet dedicated to crypto presales, with an Upcoming Tokens section that breaks down key projects and gives investors the opportunity to purchase hot new tokens before they launch. The $BEST token takes utility up a notch, lowering fees for transactions, giving exclusive presale access, and boosting rewards. It\u2019s a unique wallet with a powerful utility token, and that\u2019s part of the reason our price prediction shows that $BEST could rise 28% from its current price of $0.025125, reaching $0.035215 by the end of the year.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/june-or-doom-dogecoin-faces-6-red-months/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin is approaching a decisive inflection point, according to crypto-market commentator VisionPulsed. Throughout his latest analysis he argued that the coming fortnight must deliver an upside resolution\u2014otherwise the meme-coin risks locking in a sequence of red monthly closes that would echo bear-market conditions. Dogecoin On The Brink Of 6-Month Meltdown The analyst anchored his outlook to several recurring signals on Dogecoin\u2019s multi-time-frame charts. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a large move in June. It\u2019s going to happen. The question is, is it up or down?\u201d he began, pointing to the Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) squeezing toward levels that historically precede violent price expansion. In his view, the compression cannot last beyond the next two weekly candles: \u201cBBWP is screaming that we\u2019re about to get something \u2026 probably this week; if not this week, then next week.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree VisionPulsed balanced that volatility warning against a newly triggered hash-ribbon buy signal\u2014a metric generated when network hashrate recovers after miner capitulation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making the case that in this bull run, when we have gotten the weekly buy signals, the market actually went down and then it went up,\u201d he explained. The fractal, observed twice since 2024, invited cautious optimism that the latest cross could again invert short-term weakness into a rally: \u201cIf history is going to repeat itself, we should go down, which we did \u2026 and I would make the case that we really should hopefully get a move up in June.\u201d Yet momentum oscillators threaten that scenario. On his two-day chart the stock-RSI has curled lower for the first time since last year. \u201cThis may be the first time we print the overbought RSI and don\u2019t go up,\u201d he conceded, warning that a failure to rebound quickly would undermine the hash-ribbon signal and oblige traders \u201cto get tucked in and go to sleep because it\u2019s just always bearish.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Just Hit Its Final Support\u2014Bulls Have One Last Shot Timing is equally unforgiving. VisionPulsed framed Dogecoin\u2019s rallies inside a 70-to-80-day cycle measured from major swing lows; the current window expires in mid-June. \u201cTechnically 70 days would be the second week of June, which we\u2019re in that box right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t actually go up in June, then it is worrisome,\u201d because history suggests that a bearish June would bleed into July and August, while September is \u201calways bearish,\u201d producing what he dryly labels a \u201cone-month bull run.\u201d He added that macro cross-currents raise the stakes. \u201cThe S&#38;P 500 is starting to get close to the all-time high,\u201d he noted, suggesting that a decisive move in equities could tip crypto sentiment. At the same time Dogecoin continues to carve incrementally higher lows, a constructive but fragile pattern that now collides with the expiring cycle window: \u201cIf we\u2019re actually bullish, we kind of got to go.\u201d For traders the message is binary. A breakout to the upside in the next ten trading days would validate the hash-ribbon cross, keep the rising-lows structure intact, and reset sentiment after what the analyst counts as \u201csix out of seven red months\u201d in the making. Failure, on the other hand, risks cementing a \u201cbearish spiral\u201d that could dominate the rest of the summer and revive memories of genuine bear-market grind. As VisionPulsed put it while signing off: \u201cWe\u2019re definitely at an inflection point. The potential energy is building up.\u201d At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1958.

      "title": "Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-drop-98000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price is still ping-ponging between support and resistance, but is still moving in favor of the bulls at this point. This is due to the fact that the price is still holding well above $100,000, and this is a psychological level that could be a determinant of a bull or bear move. Amid this, crypto analyst Xanrox believes that the Bitcoin price is headed down after hitting its new all-time high close to $112,000, and this downtrend would push altcoins down further. Why The Bitcoin Price Is Breaking Down The reason for the Bitcoin price decline, as outlined by the crypto analyst, is that the leading cryptocurrency is actually breaking down out of an ascending parallel channel that was formed while the price moved from $74,000 to $112,000. This was seen in the initial downtrend that sent Bitcoin from $111,000 down to $103,000, before the relief rally. Related Reading: Wave Count Analysis Reveals The XRP Price Trigger Point For Take-Off In addition to the ascending channel, the crypto analyst also points out the formation of a symmetrical triangle inside the channel. This is also important to keep an eye on since symmetrical triangles are known for sweeping liquidity. While these liquidity sweeps are not one-sided, it is still notable as it can sweep liquidity above and below the triangle. Probabilities of the direction of the liquidity sweep increase in a direction depending on whether the bears or bulls are currently dominating. Xanrox also explains that the Bitcoin price has already completed the five full waves of the Elliot Wave theory, and as such, the next thing is a corrective ABC wave. In this case, it is expected to fall back to the 0.382, 0.500, and 0.618 Fibonacci levels again. Where To Start Buying With the expectation that the Fibonacci levels will fall to 0.382, then 0.500, and then 0.618, the first culprit for where the Bitcoin price is expected to fall to is just below $98,000. At this level, the crypto analyst believes that it is time to start buying. In addition to the chart formations, Xanrox also calls out an unfilled Fair Value Gap (FV) at this level, and once it fills, it is a great level to start buying before the next wave to the upside. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH If this decline does happen, then altcoins are expected to actually fall further from here. This would put them at great buy levels as well, especially as altcoins are sitting so close to all-time low levels. However, after the first FVG is filled and there isn\u2019t strong momentum, the second Fibonacci level at 0.500 puts the Bitcoin price at $92,000. Meanwhile, the third and last Fibonacaill level at 0.618 puts it as low as $87,500. \u201cUsually we want to look for a buying opportunity at the 0.382, 0.500, or 0.618 FIB levels,\u201d the crypto analyst explained.

      "summary": "Magic Eden, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, has announced a partnership with the team behind President Donald Trump\u2019s memecoin to create an official \u201cTRUMP-branded cryptocurrency wallet.\u201d This new product, aptly named the TRUMP Wallet, will not only feature Trump\u2019s likeness and name but will also support trading of the TRUMP token alongside other digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). TRUMP Wallet Opens Waitlist Amid Controversy The waitlist for the TRUMP Wallet opened on Tuesday at TrumpWallet.com, with a broader launch expected later this summer, as confirmed by a spokesperson from Magic Eden. In a promotional push, the project is being marketed as &#8220;the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans,&#8221; enticing users with the opportunity to share in $1 million worth of the memecoin rewards. Those who sign up and refer friends will be able to enhance their position on the waitlist. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Community Should Pay Attention To June 4-6, Here\u2019s Why Interestingly, Eric Trump, who has been involved in various cryptocurrency initiatives linked to his father, expressed surprise at the project. He took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to assert, \u201cI run @Trump and I know nothing about this project!\u201d In a follow up social media post, Eric further said: This project is not authorized by @Trump. @MagicEden I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization. KYC Details Still Unclear The announcement was shared by the official TrumpMeme account, but further details about the partnership, including terms of revenue-sharing and potential Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for users, remain unclear. This initiative is part of a larger strategy to boost engagement in Trump-related cryptocurrency ventures, which have been gaining momentum in recent months. The Presidential family\u2019s expanding crypto portfolio already encompasses a variety of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens, a stablecoin, a decentralized finance platform with its own virtual token, and memecoins named after both Donald Trump and the First Lady.

Slingshot is known for featuring various meme tokens, such as Bonk Inu (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and does not directly collect user identity information; instead, this is managed by MoonPay, the app&#8217;s fiat on-ramp provider.

      "summary": "As the Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes 5% below its all-time high of $111,800, which was reached last week, predictions of further price declines have emerged. More surprisingly, one expert claims that all of BTC\u2019s history is a &#8220;staged illusion,&#8221; which could cause it to dip toward the $10,000 mark for the first time in nearly five years. Expert Alleges Bitcoin&#8217;s Rise As &#8216;Largest Bubble In History\u2019 Jacob King, the CEO of the news aggregator Whale Whire, took to social media to assert that Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory is a carefully constructed illusion, designed to convey a sense of institutional commitment and government endorsement, thereby fostering the illusion of a thriving market driven by authentic demand. King&#8217;s bold claim characterized Bitcoin&#8217;s current state as the \u201clargest bubble in human history,\u201d poised to unfold as a monumental financial scandal. Of course, this is only King\u2019s opinion based on his analysis. Related Reading: XRP Sell-Off Rumors Swirl After Expert Questions Ripple\u2019s War Chest The narrative King presented delves into the web of interconnected entities that allegedly manipulate the cryptocurrency market. Drawing attention to the case of El Salvador&#8217;s purported Bitcoin investment, King highlighted discrepancies in the narrative, alleging that a significant portion of the country&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves had not been acquired through legitimate means but rather transferred from Bitfinex and Tether. This alleged manipulation, according to King, extends to the very core of the industry, with entities like Tether orchestrating alleged schemes to bolster liquidity and fabricate a fa\u00e7ade of institutional backing. Alleged Bitcoin Market Manipulations The unraveling of these alleged machinations, as per King&#8217;s assertions, casts doubt on the authenticity of Bitcoin&#8217;s growth and the legitimacy of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. King&#8217;s narrative underscores a network of \u201cintertwined interests,\u201d where figures like Michael Saylor, founder of the Bitcoin proxy firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), are depicted as integral players perpetuating a cycle of \u201cleverage and speculation\u201d rather than genuine investment in BTC. Furthermore, King&#8217;s reflections extend to the role of stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT in propping up the Bitcoin market, creating a \u201cfragile ecosystem\u201d wherein the value of stablecoins could potentially surpass that of traditional fiat currencies. Related Reading: Stablecoins Ignite Record-Breaking May, Supply Jumps To $244B \u2013 Data The intricate interplay between Tether&#8217;s activities and Bitcoin&#8217;s stability, according to King, forms a precarious foundation susceptible to collapse in the face of regulatory scrutiny and diminishing institutional interest. All around, King issued a stark warning about a potential nosedive in Bitcoin&#8217;s value, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might plunge towards the $10,000 threshold for the first time in almost half a decade. Expressing skepticism regarding the sustainability of Bitcoin&#8217;s current price levels, King portrayed a market on the verge of a substantial correction. If this ominous forecast materializes, it would signify a profound shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation, departing from the lofty peaks it has recently scaled. As of this writing, the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency trades at $105,788, recording a 3% retrace in the weekly time frame. Still, Bitcoin holds to gains of over 52% in the year-to-date period.
