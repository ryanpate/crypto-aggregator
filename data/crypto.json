      "summary": "Amid the chaos that was sparked by Israel\u2019s attack on Iran, Bitcoin has climbed again, shaking off the losses triggered by the conflict. Not only has the price seen an increase from its last week\u2019s lows, but there has also been a notable change in the cryptocurrency\u2019s daily trading volume. This points to continued interest despite global factors and could mean that the expectations of war are already getting priced in for the crypto market. Bitcoin Sees Almost 100% Jump In Volume According to data from Coinglass, there has been a turn in the tide for the Bitcoin trading volume after starting out the new week in a slow trend. Sunday and Monday had seen the Bitcoin daily trading volume come out under $50 billion. However, as the Bitcoin price rose leading up to Tuesday, so did the trading volume. Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT\u2019s Volume? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin daily trading volume had already crossed $88 billion for Tuesday, leading to an almost 100% increase in the trading volume during this time. This follows the trend of high volatility coming with increased volumes as the Bitcoin price swung wildly between $105,000 and $108,000. The sharp jump in volume comes as the Bitcoin open interest remains high at near all-time highs while the rest of the market struggles. Coinglass data shows the current open interest at $71 billion, less than $10 billion away from the $80 billion all-time high recorded in May 2025. In light of altcoins continuing to trend low while Bitcoin remains close to all-time highs, it suggests that most of the attention in the crypto market is now being focused on Bitcoin. As a result, the leading asset continues to dictate the direction of the market, with dominance remaining high above 64%. How War Could Affect This Trend The positive developments surrounding Bitcoin are coming as there seems to be a cooldown in the conflict in the Middle East. But with so little time having passed, expectations are that the war may only be starting, with some calling it the start of \u2018World War 3.\u2019 Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming The Kobeissi Letter has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to address these World War 3 predictions, revealing how the markets would react if there really was a possibility of this happening.

      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a notable pullback after a brief period of upward momentum earlier this month. The asset, which surged past the $2,800 level in mid-June, has since declined by 8.7% over the past week, now trading at around $2,498. This retreat follows broader market consolidation, as Ethereum struggles to maintain upward pressure despite strong on-chain activity. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues \u2013 Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Ethereum Staking and Accumulation Trends While ETH&#8217;s price action has turned negative, on-chain indicators suggest a contrasting narrative of growing investor conviction. According to insights shared by on-chain analyst OnChainSchool via CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, Ethereum has set a new record in staking activity. In the first half of June alone, more than 500,000 ETH were staked, pushing the total locked amount to over 35 million ETH. This growth in staked ETH not only reflects rising validator participation but also contributes to reducing the circulating supply, a dynamic that may influence future price movements. The report also highlights a rise in accumulation addresses, wallets that have received ETH but have never transferred any out. These addresses now collectively hold 22.8 million ETH, another all-time high. This trend is often interpreted as a sign of long-term holding behavior and suggests that certain investor cohorts are positioning themselves for future price appreciation rather than short-term gains. Taken together, the record levels of staking and accumulation point toward an increasingly illiquid supply, which, if demand increases, could amplify upward price pressure. Ethereum Hits ATH in Staking: Over 35 Million ETH Locked \u201cAlongside this, Accumulation Addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH.\u201d \u2013 By @onchainschool Read more \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/WYoX9qpODZ pic.twitter.com/6MAlK0sCfJ \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 17, 2025 A Technical Look: Price Explosion on the Horizon? In addition to the on-chain data, market participants are also analyzing Ethereum from a technical perspective. A crypto analyst on X operating under the pseudonym \u201cBitcoinsensus\u201d has drawn attention to a multi-year \u201cbullish flag\u201d pattern forming on ETH charts since 2021. A bullish flag is a technical chart formation that typically follows a strong price move upward, marked by a period of consolidation in a downward-sloping channel. If the asset breaks out of the flag to the upside, it can signal a continuation of the prior bullish trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support \u2013 Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels Bitcoinsensus suggests that if the pattern completes, Ethereum could target a move toward the $8,000 range.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross has surged into a zone that has historically signaled overpriced conditions for the asset. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Crossed Above 2.2 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross of Bitcoin. The NVT Golden Cross is an indicator based on another metric known as the NVT Ratio. The NVT Ratio keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. The idea behind the indicator is that the ability to transact coins (as gauged by the transaction volume) could be considered as a reflection of the asset&#8217;s &#8216;fair value.&#8217; Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark &#38; Whale Wallets Set New All-Time High Thus, through the comparison of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s current value (that is, the market cap) with this fair value, the metric can tell us about whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. When the value of the metric is high, it means the market cap is high compared to the transaction volume. Such a trend could imply BTC may be becoming overheated. On the other hand, the indicator being low could suggest room for the coin to grow relative to its volume. Now, the NVT Golden Cross, the actual metric of relevance here, is a signaling indicator like the Bollinger bands for the NVT Ratio that aims to locate tops and bottoms in its value. The NVT Golden Cross does so by comparing the short-term trend (represented by the 10-day MA) with the long-term one (30-day MA). Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the metric over the last couple of years. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has recently registered a sharp uptick and entered into the region above the 2.2 mark (highlighted in red). This zone is where the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market cap has historically outpaced the transaction volume to a degree that a reversion to the mean has tended to occur. In other words, it&#8217;s where price corrections to the downside have taken place for the asset. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion\u2014Warning Sign For Bitcoin? Though, it&#8217;s visible from the chart that not every top in the NVT Golden Cross inside this territory coincides with a price top. And in many instances that it does, the decline in the asset isn&#8217;t to some major degree. So far since the signal has appeared, however, the asset has indeed been going down, a potential sign that the same reversion effect may be in play once more. It now remains to be seen whether downside will be limited, or if this will be one of those instances where the signal was followed by an extended drawdown.

      "summary": "Amid the tension in the Iran-Israel conflict, the cryptocurrency market experienced another daily pullback. Bitcoin (BTC), which had just recovered from Friday\u2019s drop, erased its recent gains and recorded a 4.5% dip to the $103,000 mark in the past 24 hours. However, some analysts believe that the flagship crypto is preparing for a big move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Big Move As Price Compresses Between Key Levels \u2013 $2,100 Or $4,000 Next? Bitcoin Could See Massive Move Soon On Monday, Bitcoin attempted to break its post-November range high but failed to hold the $108,000-$109,000 area as support for the fourth time in a month, falling back into its larger range. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that this resistance level remains a key area to watch, adding that \u201cwithout a clean break above, it&#8217;s not the time to get excited just yet.\u201d Nonetheless, the trader considers that the BTC is \u201csetting up for a large move\u201d as the cryptocurrency continues to hold its monthly range between $100,000 and $110,000. He asserted that this range will break &#8220;at some point in June,\u201d as well as the current weekly high and low, which have \u201ca very low probability of being held\u201d in the coming days. Daan added that a break from these levels is highly possible in the next 1-2 weeks, likely leading to a big move in the direction of the break. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted the crypto market\u2019s performance and investors\u2019 concerns amid the war-related headlines, noting that Bitcoin reacted in a similar pattern during past geopolitical and crypto-related events. According to the analyst, global events\u2019 uncertainty has led to mass liquidation and on-chain panic multiple times since 2020, leading to 30%-50% crashes. However, the market has recovered from these events after significant accumulation. Here\u2019s the pattern: Big event (Black Swan). Panic headlines. Sharp BTC dump. Retail Panic sells. Smart money buys. Time passes. Bitcoin hits new highs. Based on this, Sjuul forecasted a strong Bitcoin pump and a new all-time high (ATH) once the current war tensions are over. BTC Holds Key Support Amid Pullback Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin has been retesting its old range high as support for the past six weeks and showing stability around the $104,400 level during this period. According to the analyst, as long as BTC\u2019s price Weekly Closes above this level, the candle wicks below it are \u201cjust noise\u201d and it is positioned to transition into its Second Price Discovery Uptrend. He also pointed out that the cryptocurrency has only seen a less than 10% dip during the recent pullbacks. Moreover, these drop depths have also been diminishing, with the first rejection producing a 7.72% drop and the second dip being 5.79% deep, while the current rejection has seen a 4.5% retrace so far. Rekt Capital considers the strongest support to be between the $102,000-$104,000 area, and the final level to break is the range high resistance of $108,890. Related Reading: XRP Must Complete Right Shoulder Before Takeoff\u2014But How Low First? &#8220;As long as this resistance isn&#8217;t rejecting price too much, then maybe it&#8217;s getting weaker over time,\u201d he affirmed, concluding that a weekly close above this level would be \u201ca very strong sign for a reclaim of this resistance into new support to springboard price higher.\u201d As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,085, a 1.1% jump in the past hour.
