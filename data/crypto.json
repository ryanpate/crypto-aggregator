      "summary": "Bitcoin rose above the $122,000 mark on Monday. According to data from CoinGecko, prices briefly topped that level before pulling back slightly. The jump comes in the face of strong inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional interest. Traders watched as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap set yet another record. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Awaits The Next Bitcoin Sale: \u2018My Fellow Pigs And I Are Feasting\u2019 Bitcoin ETFs Explode Based on reports, Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.20 billion flow in on Thursday alone. That was the biggest single\u2011day haul of 2025. Last week, QCP Capital said institutional flows into spot BTC ETFs topped $2 billion. These numbers suggest big players are betting on more upside. Open interest on futures now exceeds $43 billion. Funding rates on perpetual contracts are climbing too, showing crowded long positions. US President Donald Trump has voiced his support for clearer crypto rules. And on Monday, the US House of Representatives began debating a package of crypto bills aimed at giving firms more certainty. Companies have been adding bitcoin to their treasuries, with some corporate holdings rising by double\u2011digit percentages this year. According to BTSE COO Jeff Mei, longer\u2011term institutional buyers are driving prices higher. He forecasted that bitcoin could hit $125K \u201cin the next month or two.\u201d Mei also warned that trade disputes with the EU, Mexico and other partners might cause dips, but said buyers are holding firm. Rising Demand From Big Players Trading desks and crypto exchanges say they have seen fresh corporate orders. Some firms are buying blocks of 100 BTC or more at a time. Others are using dollar\u2011cost averaging to ease in gradually. Even smaller funds are boosting allocations, pushing aggregate demand higher. With every new all\u2011time high, more headlines appear and more investors pay attention. That creates a feedback loop: rising prices attract inflows, which lift prices further.

He sketched bitcoin\u2019s entire price history as a curved arc. The top of that arc sits near current levels, hinting at a ceiling where past rallies ended in sharp drops. Parabolic moves have a habit of reversing quickly. In just seven days, Bitcoin climbed from about $108K to over $122K\u2014roughly a 14% rise. High funding rates and record open interest signal froth, and that often precedes pullbacks. Related Reading: XRP To Hit $4 This Week?

      "summary": "Ethereum has broken out above the $3,000 level, reaching its highest price since late January and signaling a strong resurgence in momentum. The move comes as Bitcoin continues to set new all-time highs, injecting renewed optimism into the broader crypto market. This week could prove pivotal, with the arrival of \u201cCrypto Week\u201d in the US Congress, when lawmakers will debate and potentially vote on critical legislation shaping the future of digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm Amid this renewed bullish backdrop, on-chain fundamentals are strengthening. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared data showing that the supply of ETH staked has just reached a new all-time high. This milestone reflects growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, with more investors locking up their assets to secure the network and earn yield, rather than sell into strength. The surge in price and staking activity suggests a shift in sentiment as Ethereum regains its position as a core asset in institutional and retail portfolios. With macro and regulatory catalysts converging this week, ETH could be on the verge of a major breakout, especially if legislative clarity and Bitcoin&#8217;s momentum continue to drive capital into high-conviction assets like Ethereum. Ethereum Leads Altcoin Revival: Strong Fundamentals And Technical Momentum Ethereum is showing renewed bullish strength, acting as a key driver in the broader altcoin market recovery. After a prolonged consolidation phase that lasted several months, ETH has finally broken above the critical $3,000 mark, setting a new bullish structure and signaling the start of a potential macro uptrend. The recent price action has energized sentiment across the market, with many altcoins beginning to follow Ethereum\u2019s lead. Fundamentally, Ethereum remains one of the strongest assets in the space. According to on-chain data by Ted Pillows, the percentage of ETH supply staked has reached a new all-time high of 29.44%. This metric is critical, as it reflects growing long-term conviction from large holders and smart money. When ETH is staked, it is locked up and cannot be sold, suggesting that investors expect higher prices and are committed to holding through volatility. All eyes are now on the key resistance zone between $3,500 and $3,600. If Ethereum manages to push through this area with conviction, it could trigger a broader breakout across the altcoin market. Many traders are closely watching this level as a catalyst for an explosive altcoin rally, fueled by increased capital rotation and technical momentum. A decisive break above resistance could validate the new bullish structure and mark the beginning of the next major expansion phase for ETH and the altcoin market at large.

This breakout confirms a shift in trend structure following months of accumulation between $2,200 and $2,800. The recent surge has pushed ETH to its highest level since late January and sets the stage for a potential push toward the next major resistance at $3,500\u2013$3,600. The chart also reveals a bullish crossover as ETH trades above its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), now at $2,241, $2,658, and $2,801, respectively. This alignment indicates increasing buyer control and reinforces the strength of the uptrend. Notably, the breakout was supported by a spike in volume, adding further conviction to the move.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/30b-in-bitcoin-added-by-accumulator-wallets-are-long-term-players-preparing-early/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high once again, surging to $123,200 earlier today, a move that has reignited bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. After weeks of steady consolidation and strong institutional inflows, the top cryptocurrency continues its upward momentum, breaking past key psychological levels and entering uncharted territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm One of the most notable developments fueling this surge is the rise in demand from so-called \u201caccumulator\u201d addresses. According to top analyst Darkfost, these wallets\u2014classified by their consistent behavior of only accumulating BTC without any history of selling\u2014have hit a new record high in 2025. This group of addresses is often associated with high-conviction holders, including long-term retail investors, institutional participants, and funds with strategic positioning. The spike in accumulator activity reveals a deeper layer of confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trajectory. Even with BTC above $120,000, these addresses continue to stack sats aggressively, suggesting that smart money is not waiting for lower prices. Instead, they appear to be preparing for a potential continuation of the bull cycle. Accumulators Add BTC, But Will They Hold Through Volatility? As of today, Bitcoin accumulator addresses have collectively added approximately 248,000 BTC, well above the monthly average of 164,000 BTC. This significant uptick highlights a sharp increase in demand over a short period, indicating that long-term players are actively positioning themselves despite Bitcoin continuing to post new all-time highs. These addresses, often associated with entities that have never sold BTC, are typically viewed as highly sophisticated investors with long-term horizons. The recent surge in accumulation suggests these players see continued upside potential, even after Bitcoin reached $123,200. Their behavior reflects strong market confidence and a belief that the current rally may be far from over. However, there is a caveat. If Bitcoin enters a phase of correction or prolonged consolidation, some of these addresses may begin to exit their positions. Doing so would strip them of their accumulator status and introduce substantial selling pressure into the market. With the 248,000 BTC added now worth around $30 billion, any significant liquidation from this cohort could impact short-term price stability. This week will be particularly crucial. The highly anticipated \u201cCrypto Week\u201d in Washington begins, with the US House of Representatives scheduled to discuss and vote on key crypto regulatory bills. The outcomes could drive volatility and influence whether these accumulators continue to hold or begin to fold. Related Reading: Pump.fun Public Sale Ends In 12 Minutes: Token Distribution Now Underway Bitcoin Breaks Out With Strong Momentum Above $120K The 8-hour chart shows Bitcoin has decisively broken out above the key resistance at $109,300, accelerating sharply to reach new all-time highs at $123,200. This breakout follows weeks of consolidation between the $103,600 and $109,300 levels, during which Bitcoin established a solid base of support. The move was accompanied by a notable surge in volume, confirming strong buyer conviction behind the rally. Technically, BTC is now trading well above its 50, 100, and 200-period simple moving averages (SMAs), which currently sit at $110,795, $108,079, and $106,980, respectively. The bullish alignment of these moving averages supports the ongoing uptrend and indicates that buyers have regained full control of the market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb \u2013 Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground The explosive breakout above $110K suggests the market has entered a price discovery phase, where historical resistance levels offer little guidance.

      "summary": "The Bitcoin price is once again commanding the spotlight as bullish momentum propels the leading cryptocurrency to new all-time highs. With the price already breaking past the $122,000 mark, analysts are growing increasingly confident in the potential for even higher targets. A recently shared chart analysis by market expert CrediBull Crypto suggests that the current rally is far from\u2014and most importantly, no major dips are expected along the way. As a result, he has forecasted that BTC could see a significant price surge to $155,000 soon. Bitcoin Price Action Clears Path To $155,000 Bitcoin\u2019s momentum continues to gather steam, with technical indicators from CrediBull Crypto\u2019s wave analysis report signals a bullish continuation that could propel the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to $155,000 in the coming weeks. The analyst\u2019s new wave count projection suggests that Bitcoin is firmly in the middle of a powerful upward leg, with minimal signs of a pullback ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Break Above $118,000 Just The Start, Analyst Unveils \u2018Golden Number\u2019 CrediBull Crypto\u2019s shared price chart highlights a well-formed textbook Elliott Wave structure that suggests that Bitcoin is in the early stages of a strong Wave 3. Notably, BTC\u2019s recent breakout above the $112,000 range shifted market sentiment in a bullish direction. What once served as resistance was quickly flipped to support, and now price action is clearing a path toward even higher ATH targets as momentum continues to build. A critical factor supporting the analyst\u2019s optimistic BTC outlook is the daily demand zone between $98,000 and 101,000. This area served as the launch point for the previous rally above $112,000 and has remained untested ever since. With selling pressure diminishing and strength building, CrediBull Crypto believes that the price of Bitcoin will stay well above the $110,000 level. He also views a retest to $112,000 or a decline to $110,000 or below as highly unlikely under current bullish conditions. According to the analyst, Bitcoin&#8217;s projected path forward places it near $135,000 by the completion of Wave 3, followed by a brief period of consolidation before a final push toward $155,000. Bitcoin Rise Above $120,000 Is Just The Beginning As Bitcoin continues its ride above $120,000, Crypto Fella, a market expert on X, has cited the potential for the cryptocurrency to enter price discovery mode and skyrocket to uncharted levels. The analyst\u2019s chart highlights a well-defined ascending trendline beginning in early 2023, with three distinct rally zones marked by purple rectangles. Each of these phases showcases consolidation followed by an aggressive upward move, suggesting a clear pattern of accumulation and breakout. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It\u2019s Now \u2018Illegal\u2019 To Short Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why The current leg of Bitcoin\u2019s rally appears to mirror this trend from past bullish cycles but with greater force, hinting that the leading cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a parabolic surge. A key target identified in Crypto Fella\u2019s analysis sits around the $138,206 level, which aligns with the projected continuation along the trendline. This level represents the next major psychological resistance and could mark the entrance into a new phase of price discovery. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"
