      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-turns-key-resistance-into-support-momentum-builds-for-range-breakout/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is consolidating above the $2,500 mark, showing resilience amid broader market uncertainty. While bulls have successfully flipped $2,500 from resistance into support, the price still faces significant pressure below the $2,700 zone. This range-bound behavior has persisted since early May, and the coming days are likely to define the next major move, not only for ETH but also for the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens \u2013 Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s current structure, particularly after the $2,500 level was reclaimed. However, the next challenge lies in reclaiming the range high. A breakout above this key resistance could trigger a strong bullish continuation and potentially ignite an altseason, as capital often rotates into altcoins once ETH gains momentum. On the flip side, failure to sustain current support may open the door for a pullback toward lower demand levels. For now, bulls appear to be in control, but the market remains on edge, awaiting a decisive move. Whether ETH can build enough strength to break through resistance or slips into another leg of consolidation will likely shape sentiment and positioning for the weeks ahead. Ethereum Builds Strength As It Eyes Range High Ethereum continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation zone, oscillating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. After reclaiming the $2,500 level and flipping it into support, ETH now looks poised for a potential breakout. Ted Pillows highlighted this shift in momentum, stating that Ethereum is \u201clooking good\u201d and could soon revisit the upper boundary of the range. However, despite Ethereum\u2019s strength, broader market conditions remain mixed. Bitcoin\u2019s failure to break above its all-time high adds pressure to the crypto market, and altcoins continue to struggle to find solid footing. While macroeconomic uncertainty has eased following encouraging job reports and legislative developments in the US, headwinds persist. Rising US Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing delay in cutting interest rates contribute to a cautious environment. Still, Ethereum\u2019s ability to hold above $2,500 suggests bullish intent. If price pushes toward and ultimately breaks above $2,700, it could trigger a broader move across altcoins, reawakening market momentum. But without a breakout in the short term, another leg of consolidation\u2014or even a pullback\u2014remains possible. This week may prove pivotal in setting the tone for Ethereum and the altcoin market\u2019s next phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical ETH Tests Resistance As Consolidation Tightens Ethereum is trading at $2,550, holding above its key moving averages and continuing to consolidate in a tight range. The daily chart shows that ETH is attempting to break above the 200-day moving average (red), currently sitting near $2,488, while managing to stay above both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages. This convergence of key technical levels highlights the current equilibrium between bulls and bears. Despite multiple attempts since early May, Ethereum has not been able to sustain a breakout above the $2,700 mark. Each push higher has faced selling pressure, suggesting that this zone remains a major area of resistance. However, recent price action shows higher lows and strong defense of the $2,500 level, signaling building momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low \u2013 Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Trading volume remains relatively flat, which aligns with the ongoing consolidation, but could also foreshadow a volatility spike once direction is confirmed. A successful daily close above the $2,600\u2013$2,700 zone could trigger an impulsive move toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a breakdown below the $2,480 level would invalidate the bullish structure and shift sentiment. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Data shows the US Ethereum spot ETFs have seen net inflows for eight consecutive weeks now, a sign of continued institutional demand. Ethereum Spot ETF Netflow Remains Positive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the weekly netflow for the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of Ethereum has been looking. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. These ETFs trade on the traditional platforms, so they allow for an easier investment method for those who find cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets overwhelming to navigate. Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the American Ethereum spot ETFs have been doing lately: From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the netflow related to the Ethereum spot ETFs has recently been on a green streak. This means that inflows into wallets attached to the ETFs are continuously happening. Last week saw a net inflow of 61,000 ETH, worth $157.3 million at the current exchange rate. With these inflows, the spot ETFs of the cryptocurrency have seen positive values for eight straight weeks. Since institutional investors generally take this investment route into Ethereum, the continuous inflows could be a sign of sustained demand from them. Despite this interest, the ETH price has remained locked in a phase of sideways movement. Ethereum isn&#8217;t the only asset that&#8217;s observing demand on the ETFs. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has pointed out in an X post, Bitcoin has also been enjoying net inflows. As displayed in the above chart, the Bitcoin ETFs have seen a positive netflow on 16 out of the last 17 trading days. The one exception was on July 1st, when outflows occurred. In some other news, Ethereum has observed new on-chain capital inflows during the past week, as Glassnode has revealed in another X post. In the graph, the data for the Realized Cap of coins aged less than 1 week is shown for Ethereum and Solana. The &#8220;Realized Cap&#8221; measures the amount of capital that the investors have put into a given network. The version of the metric of focus here specifically calculates the capital that has come in over the past week. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the metric has seen an increase for both ETH and SOL during the past week, indicating fresh capital has flowed in.

      "summary": "The Bitcoin market appears to be coiling for a major move, according to prominent crypto analyst CrediBull Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), who highlighted today via X that over 80% of all Bitcoin in existence is currently being held by long-term investors\u2014levels of supply constraint previously seen only at major inflection points in Bitcoin\u2019s price history. Why No One\u2019s Selling Bitcoin In his post, CrediBull noted, \u201cThe only 2 times in Bitcoin&#8217;s 15 year history that this % was higher was at 43k before a $30,000 impulse to 73k and at 58k before a $50,000 impulse to 105k+.\u201d Drawing on this historical precedent, he concluded that the market is poised for another massive leg up: \u201cWhen the majority of $BTC total circulating supply is cornered by \u2018diamond hands\u2019, price moves up aggressively at the hint of any \u2018new\u2019 demand.\u201d With &#8220;excess&#8221; supply now redistributed to long-term holders and institutional entities such as Bitcoin treasury companies increasingly taking the lead, the analyst sees a clear signal: \u201cThe next impulse IS IMMINENT. This next one will also likely be even bigger than the last two ($50,000+). Who&#8217;s ready for 150k+ Bitcoin?\u201d Related Reading: 2025\u2019s Biggest Bitcoin Bull Trigger Is Still Hidden, Expert Reveals The optimism is not without a technical underpinning. In a previous post, CrediBull addressed the current market structure and his own Elliott Wave-based scenario planning: \u201cMy original count/idea shared a few days ago had us rejecting at range highs above 110k and seeing a pullback down to the BLUE zone at 102k-ish before moving sideways for a few more weeks before the next impulse begins.\u201dHowever, the analyst acknowledged a significant alternative possibility: \u201cI do still think this scenario is probable, I also recognize that there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun (most bullish scenario depicted).\u201d Given the price action and structure, CrediBull argued that the risk-reward profile no longer favors bearish positioning. \u201cIn either case, downside is relatively limited on Bitcoin from current levels imo and so focus should be on identifying potential long opps on Bitcoin rather than looking to short clear strength.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut\u2014What You Need To Know He punctuated the point with a rhetorical jab: \u201cWhy is it now illegal to short Bitcoin? Because there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun.\u201d Adding a layer of technical confirmation, analyst Axel Adler Jr provided a concurrent signal from volatility metrics. Adler pointed to a significant Bollinger Bands squeeze underway, writing: \u201cThe range between the upper and lower boundaries has fallen to 7.7%\u2014one of the lowest values throughout the entire bull cycle.\u201d Such compressions in volatility historically precede large directional moves. Adler explained, \u201cThe decrease in volatility indicates energy accumulation in the market; the price is ready for a rally, and in an upward trend environment, the chances of an upward breakout are significantly higher.\u201d In the current cycle, Adler has identified six episodes of such squeezes. Four were immediately followed by strong price appreciation, while the remaining two saw brief corrections before continuing upward. The takeaway: \u201cBased on this experience, the current squeeze most likely foreshadows another upward impulse, although a small consolidation before the move is also not ruled out.\u201d With long-term holders now controlling an overwhelming share of supply, bullish technical compression in play, and institutional adoption continuing to absorb circulating coins, the environment CrediBull describes echoes past moments of explosive upside. While nothing is guaranteed, the combination of on-chain metrics and technical indicators suggest Bitcoin\u2019s next chapter may already be beginning\u2014quietly, beneath the surface.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-to-92000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action is holding firm above the $108,000 level despite a string of minor pullbacks in recent trading sessions. Notably, CoinGecko data shows that the Bitcoin price has climbed to an intraday high of $109,116, but it wasn&#8217;t able to hold above and has retreated slightly lower at the time of writing. Volatility has been relatively subdued for Bitcoin above $106,000. However, Doctor Profit, a well-followed crypto analyst, believes Bitcoin is still in a bullish structure, and he outlined two likely paths for the next major move. Bull Flag And Breakout To $130,000 With Retest The first scenario outlined by Doctor Profit involves a breakout to a price level between $113,000 and $114,000, which would take Bitcoin to a new all-time high in the process. However, this all-time high would be very brief. According to this scenario, a sharp correction is expected to follow once Bitcoin reaches this range. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This correction will send the price back down into the $92,000 to $93,000 range to fill a CME gap and tap into a major liquidity pool. Rather than causing panic, the analyst views this move as part of a bullish continuation. This potential retracement zone is clearly marked on Doctor Profit&#8217;s daily candlestick chart with the message \u201cAdd more if market allows.\u201d The pullback, if it happens, would serve to reset the market and initiate a bounce before Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory to $120,000 again. Direct Rally To $120,000 Without Retest The second path skips the correction altogether. In this scenario, Bitcoin breaks through the flag resistance to rally past $113,000. From there, the scenario sees Bitcoin continuing upward without returning to the lower support zones. The move hinges on the ability of Bitcoin to gain momentum rapidly and lead to a strong push toward $120,000. Doctor Profit points out that this option is a more aggressive bullish continuation, and both scenarios are valid for bullish price targets in the long term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline He also debunked fears surrounding the sudden movement of a dormant Satoshi-era whale wallet containing 80,000 BTC. The analyst believes the transfer was likely an over-the-counter deal between a large private entity and an institution or government and not a sign of looming sell pressure. Volatility is going to be very low in the coming days, as there are no macro market events that can cause price volatility. FOMC meeting minutes are due Wednesday, and there are going to be US unemployment claims on Thursday, but both are low-volatility events. Nonetheless, the $113,000 to $114,000 price range is the most important level to watch in both scenarios. What follows from there, a sharp correction or a straight continuation, will define the speed of the next leg to $120,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,270.

History doesn\u2019t\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Rqc6KBfWgn \u2014 Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) July 7, 2025 Price Targets And Support Levels Tested In a follow\u2011up post, Solberg Invest on X laid out a bullish short\u2011term view. Their target sits at $0.000015 if PEPE holds above the key support line at $0.0000102. That level has been tested multiple times in recent weeks, demonstrating some buying interest each time prices approached it. Traders warn that slipping below $0.0000102 could derail hopes for the next big leg up. Triangle Formation Signals Tension A recent chart indicates that PEPE is trading within a triangle pattern. Traders track triangles closely because they can lead to rapid moves following a breakout. Currently, PEPE is wedged at the top of this triangle. When trading volume picks up and the token closes over the old resistance line (indicated in red), it could ignite a new wave of buyers. Community Buzz Keeps Meme Coins Alive Meme tokens survive by social fervor, and PEPE has developed a devoted fan base on sites like X. Meme posts and community-led memes have powered previous rallies, prompting new investors to jump aboard. According to reports, continued buzz might be sufficient to initiate another run at least in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details Risks And Rewards In Focus Even if history does rhyme, it doesn&#8217;t often repeat itself. Previous runs had PEPE tank just as severely, losing as much as 95% of profits in one session. Gambling on a 20X spike involves taking wild swings and sudden plunges. Anyone considering coming in at $0.0000102 should have in mind exit points and only risk capital that can be safely lost. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"
