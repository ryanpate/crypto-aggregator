      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-break-above-108500/",
      "summary": "A crypto analyst has forecasted a powerful Wave 3 Bitcoin price rally that could take it toward new all-time highs between $160,000 and $200,000. Notably, this surge is expected to come with rising Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) and a delayed altcoin season, particularly if BTC can make a clean break above the $108,500 resistance level. Bitcoin Price Breakout To Spark Next Bull Run The Bitcoin price is currently hovering below a critical resistance level at $108,500, and according to a crypto analyst known as \u2018BigMike7335\u2019 on the X social media platform, a clean breakout and flip of this level into support could ignite an explosive Wave 3 bull run. Based on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci Extension analysis, a successful move above this threshold could open the door to a bullish price surge with potential targets set in the $160,000 to $200,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Double Top Above $106,000: FVG Says A Large Crash Is Coming The analyst\u2019s chart shows that Bitcoin has already completed its Wave 1 of a five-wave impulse move, followed by an ABC corrective Wave 2. The market is also currently consolidating, and Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum appears to be rebuilding. These positive developments are supported by a rising Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the oversold region and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, both of which point toward upward price action. Notably, the 0.618 and 1.0 Fibonacci Extensions around $117,795 and $137,421, respectively, are highlighted as interim resistance zones where price momentum could temporarily slow before continuing upward. A clean breakout above $108,500 could also place Bitcoin above a heavy volume node visible in the volume profile within the chart, suggesting less overhead resistance and a stronger potential for a price rally. Furthermore, the analysis implies that during this powerful Wave 3 phase, Bitcoin Dominance will likely climb toward 70%. This increase in BTC.D would mean capital is concentrating in the leading cryptocurrency, which historically results in altcoins underperforming. As a result, the expected altcoin season for this cycle may be postponed, following the completion or cooling of Wave 3. Analyst Predicts $375,000 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak Crypto analyst TechDave has just sounded the alarm on what he calls the Bitcoin \u201claunch signal\u201d, a rare trigger that has only appeared four times in history and each time marked the start of major bull market rallies. This signal previously appeared in October 2012, July 2016, and July 2020\u2014all preceding major upward moves that ended in new cycle peaks. Related Reading: Fading Spot Volumes And Muted Futures Sentiment Threaten To Send Bitcoin Below $99,000 Again Currently, the same signal is emerging this July, aligning with the previous cycle structures and reinforcing the expectation of a breakout phase.

Following this historical pattern, TechDave now predicts a fresh cycle top for Bitcoin at $375,000. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Shaun Donelly knows a hot item when he sees one \u2013 and Bitcoin\u2019s the hottest item of them all. The CEO of the Lingerie Fighting Championship plans to build the company\u2019s own Bitcoin treasury, and he\u2019s taking inspiration from an unlikely source: GameStop. Is this a flash in the pan, or is the Lingerie Fighting Championship onto something? And what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin treasuries \u2013 and for innovative applications of the blockchain? From GameStop, to Strategy, and Back Again Remember the glory days of GameStop stonks? Back when Robinhood, the trading platform, and GameStop were household names, at least for a certain sector of the trading populace. Since the heady days of $81.25 $GME stock, back in 2021, GameStop has largely trundled along, doing its own thing. Over the past year, it traded in a fairly narrow range, up a little under 5%. But GameStop did make a big splash a few weeks ago, when it announced that it was taking a step back from Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy approach, and would be amassing its own Bitcoin treasury. Ironically, back in 2020 and 2021, when $GME was soaring, Michael Saylor had already started to take the approach with (Micro)Strategy that would make him famous, purchasing Bitcoin early and often. And as Bitcoin\u2019s price rose, Strategy\u2019s strategy paid off. So when GameStop announced that it would follow in Saylor\u2019s footsteps, some heads turned. And without further ado, GameStop purchased 4,170 Bitcoin. GameStop Inspires LFC Back to Shaun Donelly. The LFC CEO watched GameStop make its big Bitcoin purchase and decided to follow suit. To that end, the LFC will purchase $230K of Bitcoin in the next month; they plan to spend up to $2M in the next six months. The move comes ahead of a series of first-ever UK shows, with key fighters in the LFC ready to take the stage. It\u2019s not a trendsetting move, but rather one that follows a Bitcoin treasury strategy that has been adopted by companies both large and small alike, and even by the US government itself. And there\u2019s every sign that GameStop isn\u2019t done \u2013 the company has $450M of a potential $2.25B ready to deploy to bolster its Bitcoin supply, according to a recent SEC filing. Donelly hopes that his company can tap into the same energy Strategy did, and maybe even a bit of the same profit over the next decade; since making its first Bitcoin purchase, $MSTR stock is up 3,170%. There\u2019s another project in the works that aims to take advantage of the healthy crypto climate. SUBBD Token aims to spice up the $85B content creation market with a combination of AI + blockchain. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) \u2013 Bringing Fans and Creators Together with $SUBBD The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is another red-hot commodity. The SUBBD platform unleashes AI content management and production, bringing both together in one place for the first time. Creators gain new ways to connect with their fans, who can use $SUBBD to access exclusive content and receive subscription discounts. At the same time, the $SUBBD platform offers several AI tools, including: \u2705 AI profile creation \u2705 AI voice notes \u2705 AI video generator \u2705 AI livestream The entire suite can be used to boost AI influencers and to manage content from human creators. And with $SUBBD, both fans and creators alike can token-gate exclusive content to create new and more personal ways of interacting. The SUBBD Token presale, now on, has raised over $714K so far. Tokens are priced at $0.0558. Our price prediction shows the token price could reach $0.438by by the end of 2025, returning 684% to current investors. Learn how to buy SUBBD Token with our guide. Visit the SUBBD Token presale to learn more. From SUBBD to the LFC From GameStop to MicroStrategy and now to the Lingerie Fighting Championship, the Bitcoin treasury strategy continues to ripple across unexpected sectors. Shaun Donelly\u2019s $2M commitment to BTC might seem unconventional, but it reflects a broader realization: Bitcoin \u2013 and crypto more broadly \u2013 is no longer fringe; it\u2019s foundational. Projects like SUBBD Token are capitalizing on blockchain\u2019s flexibility, merging AI, content creation, and fan engagement in powerful new ways. In the ring and online, the crypto fight is heating up. Remember to always do your own research; this isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "summary": "Tom Lee, the market strategist known for his insightful predictions on Bitcoin (BTC) and broader crypto prices, has taken on the role of chairman of the board at BitMine Immersion Technologies, a Bitcoin mining company now setting its sights on becoming the largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH). Tom Lee Appointed Chairman At BitMine Lee\u2019s appointment comes alongside an ambitious plan to raise $250 million in a private placement aimed at implementing a strategy that positions Ethereum as the primary treasury reserve asset, while still maintaining its core Bitcoin mining operations. This initiative reflects a growing trend within the financial services sector, where the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency is gaining momentum, further highlighted by President Trump\u2019s decision to establish a strategic crypto reserve. Related Reading: Solana Forms Bullish Flag On Daily Chart \u2014 Breakout Imminent? Lee highlighted this shift during an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d stating, \u201cThe financial services industry and crypto are converging, and it really started with stablecoins.\u201d Lee likened stablecoins to the &#8220;ChatGPT of crypto,&#8221; emphasizing their widespread adoption among consumers, businesses, and financial institutions, including major players like Visa. Interestingly, stablecoins have gained a major victory in Congress last week with the passage of the GENIUS Act which aims to provide a new regulatory framework for these crypto assets. Transforming Into An Ethereum Treasury Powerhouse According to Lee, Ethereum serves as the foundational architecture for stablecoins, making it crucial for BitMine to accumulate ETH in order to influence and secure its position within the network. The company&#8217;s strategy will include monitoring the value of Ethereum held per share as a key performance metric, akin to Strategy&#8217;s (previouisly MicroStrategy) well-known \u201cBTC Yield\u201d metric for Bitcoin. During his interview, Lee explained that BitMine plans to enhance the value of ETH per share through reinvestment of cash flows, capital market activities, and the appreciation of Ethereum itself. As more companies explore treasury management strategies beyond Bitcoin, BitMine is not alone in its pivot. It joins other firms like SharpLink Gaming, which initiated its own Ethereum treasury strategy earlier this year, and DeFi Development, which is focusing on Solana.

BitMine&#8217;s stock, trading under the ticker name BMNR, also saw a major surge on Monday closing the day at $33.90 per share. According to Yahoo Finance data, this means a nearly 700% surge for the mining firm\u2019s shares.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-breaks-out-across-the-board-but-one-things-missing/",
      "summary": "XRP has slipped the leash that has restrained it since the mid-January peak at $3.40, with the latest weekly candle closing a fraction above the descending trend-line that has defined the upper boundary of its six month trendline. At press time the token is quoting $2.22 on major spot venues, having tagged an intraday high of $2.31 a few hours after the weekly open. XRP Flashes Triple Breakout The technical alignment behind today\u2019s move is unusually tight. The price itself has edged through trend-line resistance traced from the 16 January swing high, but the same behaviour is evident beneath the surface. On the momentum pane the weekly relative-strength index, muted since late March, has poked above its own falling resistance line at 54, ending a sequence of lower RSI highs that mirrored each failed rally in price. A similar story is unfolding on the WaveTrend Oscillator: the fast and slow signal lines have curled upward and printed a tentative positive cross just below the zero-line. Taken together, the trifecta\u2014price above pennant roof, RSI above trend-line, WTO signals turning\u2014constitutes what technicians refer to as confluence: three independent tools broadcasting the same directional bias on the same timeframe. The only missing ingredient is conviction in volume. Seasoned chart-watchers will want to see that metric expand in the coming sessions to validate the move. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 Independent analyst Maelius (@MaeliusCrypto), who posted the chart that first drew the community\u2019s attention, summed up the state of play in a single line: \u201cXRP teasing us with a breakout! Asking for volume to follow!\u201d The plea is well-placed. Trendline resolutions that lack a parallel surge in activity are prone to fail-back tests; a decisive influx of bids is required to flip the freshly conquered trend-line into reliable support. Support for the bullish case is also visible on slower-moving gauges. The 50-week exponential moving average now rises through $1.84, its steepest positive slope in more than two years, and the current candle sits comfortably above that long-term trend proxy. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure\u2014Analyst Says \u2018Fireworks Ahead\u2019 Should the breakout hold and attract the liquidity Maelius is watching for, classical chart theory projects an initial objective near the midpoint of January\u2019s supply shelf around $3.00. A weekly close back beneath the trend-line, by contrast, would neutralise the pattern and expose the high-volume node at the demand zone near $2.0 and the $1.84 price tag if bears regain momentum. For now the market is balanced on the knife-edge between promise and proof. Price, RSI and WTO have all stepped over their respective fault lines; only the tape itself remains to confirm that traders are prepared to follow through. Whether this triple breakout marks the beginning of XRP\u2019s next leg higher\u2014or merely another feint within a larger consolidation\u2014will be determined in the sessions ahead. At press time, XRP traded at $2.21. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the leading corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), is on the verge of reaching a significant milestone as it approaches the acquisition of 600,000 tokens. In its latest move, the company purchased 4,980 Bitcoin between June 23 and June 29 for an average price of $106,801 each, totaling approximately $531.9 million. This latest purchase has brought the company\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325, acquired for around $42.4 billion. Strategy Shares Surge 4.7% Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s price remaining relatively stable at around $107,000 and $107,500 over the past 24 hours, Strategy&#8217;s shares, MSTR, increased by 4.7% to $402.07 on Monday, reflecting investor confidence in the company&#8217;s financial moves. The value of Strategy&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings now stands at roughly $64 billion. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure\u2014Analyst Says \u2018Fireworks Ahead\u2019 Funding for these latest acquisitions came through the sale of stock under various at-the-market offerings. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer noted that the company&#8217;s Bitcoin yield, which measures the change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to total shares outstanding, was 19.7% between January 1 and June 29. Strategy&#8217;s Chairman, Michael Saylor, who is often regarded as one of Bitcoin&#8217;s most vocal advocates, hinted at the recent purchase in a social media post over the weekend. He stated, \u201cIn 21 years, you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d bought more,\u201d alongside a chart illustrating the performance of Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin portfolio since its initial investment in late 2020, which shows the aggressive purchases that have increased over the past year. Bitcoin Price Hovers Around $107,000 Interestingly, the company had made a smaller purchase of 245 Bitcoins between June 16 and June 22, considerably less than its usual massive acquisitions. For context, Strategy had previously acquired 10,100 Bitcoins in just six days during the period from June 9 to June 15. This shows that while the company often makes large purchases, it can also vary its acquisition strategy based on market conditions. Over the past month, the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has seen a notable volatility spike with prices failing to tackle its current record price of $111,800 reached during last month\u2019s rally.

Since, Bitcoin has managed to endure subsequent price drops, with the most recent plunging BTC toward the $98,000 zone. However, the cryptocurrency has managed to record a 2.4% recovery on the weekly time frame, currently consolidating at $107,000. Originally founded as an enterprise software firm, Strategy has transformed into a leveraged play on Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly owning it. Since August 2020, the company has consistently increased its Bitcoin reserves by selling stock and debt. This has prompted criticism from analysts who believe this could be dangerous if the Bitcoin price drops below the firm\u2019s average buying price.
