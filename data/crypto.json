      "summary": "Crypto analyst Jaydee has predicted a 50% rally for the XRP price. He highlighted a resistance level, which the altcoin needs to break above on its BTC pair to record this massive uptrend. XRP Price Eyes 50% Rally With Break Above $2.20 In an X post, Jaydee predicted that the XRP price will record a 50% \u201cmoonshot\u201d rally once it breaks above the $0.00002 resistance level on its Bitcoin pair. XRP has since broken above this resistance level, suggesting that this moonshot rally may be imminent, with the altcoin surging to as high as $3.35. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 A rally to $3.35 will bring the XRP price close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. In a subsequent analysis, Jaydee confirmed that XRP could rally to new ATHs with a successful break above this resistance level. On the other hand, he warned that the altcoin could crash to as low as $1.60 if it fails to hold this level on at least the 3-day timeframe. Crypto analyst Guy also recently predicted that the XRP price could rally to a new ATH of $5.30. The analyst indicated that the $2.33 level is the key to kickstarting this uptrend for the altcoin. Once XRP breaks above, he predicts that it will rally to $2.55. A break above this $2.55 level would then pave the way for another rally to the current ATH and the Fibonacci extension at $5.30. Possible Scenarios Following Break Above $2.30 In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined three potential scenarios that could unfold following the XRP price break above $2.30. The first scenario is the cleanest move, in which she predicts that XRP could run towards $2.45, then flips $2.30 into support on a backtest. CasiTrades remarked that this gives the altcoin a solid base for a move to $2.69 and beyond. Related Reading: Will XRP Dethrone Ethereum To Lead This Altcoin Season? For the second scenario, the crypto analyst described this as a more aggressive move. In this case, she predicts that the XRP price could record a sharp breakout through $2.30 and head straight to $2.69. From there, she added that the altcoin could pull back to $2.45 as the mid-way support zone before continuing its uptrend. The third scenario is the most bullish for the XRP price. CasiTrades predicts that the altcoin could break through $2.69, confirm this price level as support, and then clear the way towards $3 and above. This would then put the current ATH in sight for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.32, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "summary": "Ethereum has finally pushed above the critical $2,600 level after weeks of range-bound trading, marking a potential turning point in its price structure. This breakout comes as bullish momentum builds, with Ethereum now preparing for a possible expansion toward the $2,800 resistance level\u2014a zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts since early May. The coming days will be decisive in shaping Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory, especially if bulls manage to drive the price beyond this key barrier. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise A breakout above $2,800 would not only signal renewed strength in Ethereum but could also catalyze a broader altcoin rally. Market sentiment is gradually shifting, with traders growing more optimistic amid easing macroeconomic pressures and signs of renewed risk appetite. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared an Ethereum chart showing a clear upward breakout from compression. This technical pattern typically precedes strong directional moves, and in this case, it favors the bulls. Pillows suggests that Ethereum is taking the lead while Bitcoin remains in consolidation, indicating that ETH may be setting the pace for the next phase of the crypto cycle. All eyes are now on the $2,800 level, which could unlock significant upside if breached. Ethereum Leads the Charge: Major Move Ahead Since early May, Ethereum has traded within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, unable to break out despite several attempts. This extended period of sideways action has built up pressure, and market participants widely expect the next move to be significant. Bulls have shown resilience, defending demand levels and keeping ETH above the $2,500 mark for several weeks. However, a clear breakout above critical resistance is still needed to confirm a broader bullish trend. Altcoins continue to struggle, with most still trading below key resistance levels. Many analysts agree that a sustained Ethereum breakout is the missing trigger for the long-awaited altseason. Market leadership from ETH has historically marked the start of major altcoin rallies, and the current setup could be no different. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a 4-hour chart highlighting an upward breakout from a compression pattern just above $2,600. According to Pillow\u2019s analysis, Ethereum is leading the market while Bitcoin remains in a holding pattern below all-time highs. This leadership role for ETH could signal a shift in capital toward altcoins, especially if Ethereum follows through and breaks the $2,800 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support \u2013 Momentum Builds For Range Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Upward Momentum Builds Above $2,600 Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after breaking above the key $2,600 level. The 12-hour chart reveals a bullish structure forming, with ETH currently trading at $2,612.61. This move follows a sustained period of consolidation between $2,400 and $2,600, where buyers consistently defended lower levels. Now, Ethereum is printing higher lows and gradually reclaiming its moving averages. Price is now trading above the 50-period and 100-period simple moving averages (SMAs), currently positioned at $2,483.37 and $2,536.77, respectively. This alignment is bullish and suggests ETH is building momentum for a potential retest of the $2,700\u2013$2,800 resistance zone. A successful break above this area would confirm the breakout from compression and open the door for a more significant rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens \u2013 Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Volume remains moderate, but recent green candles show growing buyer interest as ETH pushes upward.

      "summary": "Trump Media &#38; Technology Group (TMTG) quietly lodged an S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission late on July 8, seeking approval for the \u201cTruth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.\u201d Despite a swirl of social-media posts placing the paperwork in early June, the SEC\u2019s time-stamp confirms the filing date as July 8. The prospectus sketches a five-coin portfolio weighted approximately 70 percent to bitcoin, 15 percent to ether, 8 percent to solana, 5 percent to Cronos and 2 percent to XRP, making it the first Trump-branded product to diversify beyond the two largest digital assets. The trust, structured as a Nevada business trust and sponsored by boutique issuer Yorkville America Digital, aims to list its shares on NYSE Arca. Foris DAX Trust \u2014 the US institutional arm of Crypto.com \u2014 is named digital-asset custodian, while authorized participants will create and redeem blocks of 10,000 shares in kind or for cash, subject to NYSE rule changes. The prospectus also discloses that staking rewards on ether, solana and cronos may be passed through to the fund, a design choice that would set a precedent among US spot-crypto ETFs. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why XRP Stands To Gain Big From Ripple\u2019s RLUSD Analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg distilled the filing in two succinct posts on X: \u201cNew filing for the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, which will be a spot crypto basket holding Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP and Cronos,\u201d he wrote; in a follow-up, he reproduced the pivotal language: \u201cthe Trust\u2019s allocation\u2026 is initially expected to approximate 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP.\u201d Those percentages now serve as the market\u2019s working model for how the Trump universe ranks crypto\u2019s \u2018blue chips.\u2019 Why Solana, Cronos And XRP? Overall, the allocation may serve as an implicit ranking of the top five crypto assets as viewed through the lens of Trump\u2019s inner circle. Binance top trader by PnL Nachi (@alphawifhat) commented via X: \u201cI think it&#8217;s useful to look at the allocation ratio of the Truth Social Crypto ETF [&#8230;] I see this as an indication of how Trump&#8217;s crypto team looks at the top crypto assets and what are the top 5 they want to value the most. This could be a catalyst to pump CRO as it&#8217;s a dark horse.\u201d Solana\u2019s climb to an 8 percent weight is more than a momentum trade. CME Group this spring announced cash-settled Solana futures pending CFTC sign-off, extending the same institutional rails that helped bitcoin and ether graduate into ETF form. Notably, the SEC has set a July deadline for spot Solana ETF refilings, indicating a potential approval before the October 2 deadline. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Cronos leaps over better-capitalized tokens because Crypto.com is literally powering Trump\u2019s ETFs. \u201cWe are proud to partner with Trump Media and Yorkville\u2026 including the first-of-its-kind basket of tokens featuring CRO,\u201d Crypto.com co-founder Kris Marszalek said in March when the multi-year, roughly $2.7 billion partnership was unveiled. Under the agreement, Crypto.com supplies custody, liquidity and back-end order routing for all Truth-branded funds. XRP brings up the rear at two percent, reflecting both its renewed legitimacy and its still-nascent institutional plumbing. On June 27, Ripple Labs announced that it will withdraw its cross appeal against the SEC. The token\u2019s modest two-percent slice is politicized as much as it is financial. In early March a staffer from Ballard Partners\u2014the K-Street shop that counts Ripple as a client\u2014slipped Donald Trump draft language for a Truth Social post urging that XRP, Solana and Cardano be placed in a national \u201cCrypto Strategic Reserve.\u201d Trump hit \u201cpost\u201d and only later discovered the Ripple connection; insiders told Politico he \u201cwas furious and felt like he\u2019d been used.\u201d Despite that, the inclusion of XRP still shows Trump\u2019s ties with Ripple.

      "summary": "Tether Holdings, the issuer of the market\u2019s largest stablecoin, USDT, has revealed that it maintains a vault in Switzerland to safeguard an impressive $8 billion stockpile of gold. According to Bloomberg, the firm&#8217;s significant reserve of nearly 80 tons positions Tether as one of the largest gold holders globally, surpassed only by central banks and sovereign nations with the company based in El Salvador expressing intentions to expand its gold reserves further. Tether Reveals 5% Of Reserves In Precious Metals In a recent interview, Tether&#8217;s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the security of their vault, claiming it to be among the most secure facilities worldwide. While he confirmed the vault\u2019s location in Switzerland, he opted not to disclose its exact whereabouts, citing security concerns. Related Reading: PEPE Traders Spot Breakout Echo\u2014Explosive Surge Back On The Table? Tether is best known for its stablecoin, USDT, which aims to maintain a one-to-one value with the US dollar. According to CoinMarketCap data, USDT dominates the stablecoin market with a capitalization of $158 billion. Circle\u2019s USDC follows closely behind with a capitalization of $61 billion. However, both companies are expected to see a major surge in this metric as the recently approved US Senate stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, aims to provide issuers with a new regulatory framework that could further boost adoption and usage of the assets by traditional financial companies. The company also generates revenue by exchanging dollars for USDT tokens and investing the collateral in various assets, including US Treasuries. According to Tether&#8217;s latest financial report, precious metals now account for nearly 5% of the company\u2019s reserves. Benefits Of The Gold-Backed XAUT Token In addition to USDT, Tether has introduced a gold-backed token known as XAUT, with each token representing one ounce of gold. Token holders have the option to redeem their XAUT for physical gold, which can be collected directly from the Swiss vault. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In Ardoino articulated a growing belief in gold as a safer asset compared to national currencies, particularly in light of rising concerns over the increasing debt levels in the United States. He noted that as these concerns grow, investors may seek alternatives, such as gold. The firm\u2019s CEO further highlighted that every central bank within the BRICS nations is actively purchasing gold, which he believes has contributed to the rising price of the precious metal. Per the report, the decision to establish Tether&#8217;s own vault rather than relying on traditional precious metals vault operators was primarily influenced by cost considerations. As of press time, Circle\u2019s newly launched stock, CRCL, has closed the trading day at $204, approximately a 31% gap between current valuations and their record price of $298.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/analyst-predicts-2000-cardano-rally/",
      "summary": "Crypto-market commentator \u201cQuantum Ascend\u201d devoted a 8 June video to a single idea: the price structure that once catapulted Ethereum Classic to its bull-market peak is about to do the same for Cardano\u2014and could deliver a twenty-fold advance if history \u201crhymes rather than repeats.\u201d Speaking to his followers, the analyst opened by noting that ADA\u2019s weekly chart \u201clooks so similar\u201d to the multi-year pattern that preceded Ethereum Classic\u2019s vertical move in early 2021. \u201cThey have the same market makers,\u201d he asserted, pointing out that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson had early involvement in both projects. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a cheat code for this thing.\u201d Cardano Set For 2,000% Explosion To illustrate the parallel, Quantum Ascend overlaid the two assets\u2019 Elliott-wave counts. In his reading, Ethereum Classic completed its fifth impulsive wave during the last cycle, whereas Cardano is \u201cwaiting on that fifth wave\u201d after a prolonged flag-shaped consolidation. He then dropped a Fibonacci retracement on Ethereum Classic\u2019s 2020\u201321 third-to-fourth-wave segment, showing the final thrust topped out \u201cjust shy of the 2.36\u201d\u2014and repeated the exercise on Cardano\u2019s current structure, which has advanced to the same proportional level. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut you guys see how similar these structures are.\u201d A second Fibonacci projection, stretching Cardano\u2019s initial three-wave span to a full 1.618 extension, points to a conservative target \u201cup around four bucks,\u201d he said. But a more ambitious extrapolation of Ethereum Classic\u2019s 3.618 climax would propel ADA into a zone between roughly 10.67 and 12.55\u2014an area he calls his \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d objectives. From the current price such a run would exceed 2,000 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s violent,\u201d he remarked after flicking his cursor to the comparative surge on the ETC chart. \u201cHopefully you can see how clean this is, because I feel really good about Cardano getting up into that $10 level.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Turns Upward \u2014 Signs of a Recovery Emerge Quantum Ascend argued that the temporal spacing is also lining up. Ethereum Classic\u2019s listing in August 2016 meant its multiyear base completed roughly four and a half years later; Cardano\u2019s analogous base, begun in late 2017, is now of similar duration, though \u201cthe whole chart has taken a little bit longer on the consolidation.\u201d For him, that extension merely \u201cloads the spring\u201d for a sharper repricing once last season begins in earnest. The analyst did allow for interim turbulence. In his scenario, ADA could hit the former all-time-high region around $3.12, \u201creject back down to $1.67\u201d during a broader market-wide wave-four shake-out, and only then launch into a blow-off toward the upper Fibonacci cluster. Still, even that corrective loop reinforces the fractal: \u201cOver here with Ethereum Classic it got to its last all-time high, rejected, and then went on one more big run.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano Price Woes To Continue? Analyst Expects ADA To Fall To $0.47 Quantifying his own risk appetite, Quantum Ascend told viewers he is \u201cpretty hyped on Cardano\u201d and wants the token \u201cin my portfolio because it is one of my higher-conviction plays for what\u2019s about to happen here.\u201d He concluded by sketching three tiers of price objectives\u2014$4.90 (conservative), $10.67 (primary) and $12.45 (secondary). Whether altseason\u2019s starting gun fires as cleanly as the fractal implies remains to be seen, but Quantum Ascend\u2019s thesis hinges on a single proposition: when the same market makers move two historically linked assets through mirror-image patterns, ignoring the setup may prove costlier than betting against it. At press time, ADA traded at $0.59. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
