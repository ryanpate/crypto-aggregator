Investors appear to be waiting for a clear sign before moving capital. Right now, USDT holds over 66% of that market, while USDC and DAI share the rest.

That\u2019s a big number. In past cycles, once those balances peak, money often moves into smaller tokens. Right now, Bitcoin\u2019s price is steadying after recent swings. Stablecoin balances keep growing. I can\u2019t promise anything, but there\u2019s a strong chance that a powerful Altcoin Season will take hold in the third quarter of 2025.

The main reasons are the large amount of\u2026 https://t.co/TjRyxBxSKs \u2014 Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) June 24, 2025 Altcoin Season On The Horizon Based on forecasts from analyst Joao Wedson, altcoins could see a lift in Q3 2025. He points to the huge amount of stablecoin liquidity and persistent doubt among retail and big players. That stage of doubt has come before in other cycles, and it usually marks a turning point. When confidence returns, altcoins tend to surge. Investors Poised On The Sidelines Many holders seem ready to hit buy. They\u2019re holding onto stablecoins until charts, on-chain data or macro news clear up. A boost in stablecoin flows to exchanges could be one early hint that rotation is starting. Large moves by whale wallets into low-cap tokens may follow. In recent weeks, inflows of stablecoins into trading platforms have ticked higher. That\u2019s a key signal to watch. If weekly inflows rise sharply\u2014say above $5 billion\u2014it may show serious appetite building. Past cycles saw similar spikes just before altcoin rallies began. Another one to monitor is decentralized finance platform volume. When stablecoins move from wallets to lending or liquidity pools, it usually indicates that traders are looking for return and preparing to swap to other tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Market observers will also be monitoring Bitcoin&#8217;s consolidation range closely.

Based on these signals, it looks like we\u2019re in a waiting game. Stablecoin supplies are at record levels, Bitcoin is settling, and altcoin sentiment remains low. When all that lines up just right, funds are likely to rotate. Then the altcoin sector could see new life. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/optimism/optimism-flickers-at-0-553/",
      "summary": "Crypto Man MAB, in his latest analysis on X, pointed out that Optimism (OP) is now priced at $0.553, showing a mild increase of +0.004 (+0.73%) within the last four hours. While the short-term movement is slightly positive, he emphasized that the overall trend has been bearish since the asset peaked near $0.75, marking a clear phase of correction in the market. Trend And Volume Analysis OF Optimism (PO) Delving into the trend, Crypto Man MAB observed that the asset&#8217;s short-term trend is leaning bearish. Over the past 24 hours, the price of OP has declined from a high of $0.564 to a low of $0.483, forming a downward trajectory. He noted that the longer-term outlook reinforces this sentiment, as the asset has dropped by a steep 71.02% over the last 180 days, clearly signaling sustained downward pressure. Related Reading: Aave Address Count On Optimism Rapidly Growing, Will Price Rise To New 13-Month High? Turning attention to volume behavior, Crypto Man MAB emphasized the significance of recent spikes in OP&#8217;s trading volume, particularly during the sharp price decline. He explained that this increase in volume often indicates heightened market participation, most likely driven by panic selling or stop-loss triggers. The volume surge during this dip suggests that the bears are still active and in control. In his analysis, Crypto Man MAB further mentioned that the Volume SMA reflects periodic surges, with the most recent peak aligning with the downward movement in price. This alignment between rising volume and falling price often reflects a strong bearish sentiment, reinforcing the downward pressure seen on the chart. Support, Resistance, And Indicators Examining OP&#8217;s support and resistance levels, the analyst points out that the current price is trading near $0.483. This zone could act as a potential support if selling pressure begins to slow, offering a chance for a temporary stabilization or bounce. However, a sustained break below this level might signal further downside in the near term. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Faces Potential Decline To $1.80 \u2014 Analyst On the flip side, the nearest resistance lies around $0.564, which represents the 24-hour high. If the price attempts a recovery, this level will likely serve as the first barrier to overcome. A successful move above it could signal improving sentiment, though further confirmation would be needed to shift the short-term bias away from bearish. Looking at the chart patterns, recent candlesticks show a mix of bullish and bearish activity, but the red candles have been more dominant. This pattern reinforces the ongoing downward momentum, indicating that sellers still have control. Until there is a visible shift in momentum, the overall tone remains cautious despite pockets of potential support. Featured image from YouTube, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "The Dogecoin price is in focus, having closed the daily candle with a Doji. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade commented on this development and revealed what it could mean for the foremost meme coin. What\u2019s Next For Dogecoin Price Following Doji Daily Close In an X post, Trader Tardigrade highlighted the fact that the Dogecoin price daily candle closed with a Doji. He remarked that a new sign of a breakout has emerged following a Doji at the end of a downtrend. The analyst noted that this indicates a high possibility of a trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Historical Bounce Zone, But Will This Time Be Different? The Dogecoin price has witnessed a massive decline over the last month, down over 27% during this period, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOGE has dropped way below the psychological $0.2 price level, providing a bearish outlook for the meme coin. However, Trader Tardigrade\u2019s analysis suggested that the meme coin could soon record another massive rally to the upside. The analyst\u2019s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reclaim the $0.2 level on this projected trend reversal to the upside. Fundamentals also support a DOGE rally, seeing as tensions in the Middle East have cooled off, with Israel and Iran agreeing to a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has again rallied and reclaimed the $106,000 level. This is bullish for the meme coin given its correlation with the flagship crypto. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, stating that DOGE season could be approaching soon. He revealed that the DOGE/BTC pair has experienced the last shakeout, signaling the start of the meme coin\u2019s season. His accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could rally above $2 once this DOGE season begins. Key Levels To Watch For DOGE In a YouTube video, crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the range between $0.12 and $0.142 as the key level to watch for the Dogecoin price. The analyst also alluded to DOGE\u2019s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), stating that the meme coin cannot afford to drop below 38. He claimed that a drop could lead to the meme coin falling into a bear market structure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.2: 4H Order Block Shows Exactly What\u2019s Happening Kevin Capital then highlighted the DOGE/BTC pair, noting that the meme coin is at a critical level that it needs to hold above if it is to outperform Bitcoin later in the year. The analyst expects the meme coin to make a significant run and outperform the flagship crypto when the Fed begins to ease monetary policies. The analyst remarked that a positive for DOGE is that there are bullish indicators flashing for the meme coin on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "In a sign of crypto\u2019s accelerating maturation, two major developments reinforce how institutional adoption and investor confidence are surging in tandem. BitGo, one of the largest crypto custodians, has seen its assets under custody balloon to $100B in 2025. Polymarket \u2013 a decentralized prediction market \u2013 is set to raise $200M at a $1B valuation, riding the wave of surging interest in crypto-native applications. The stories showcase how demand for both regulated, institutional-grade services and platforms is growing rapidly. Safety Plus Speculation BitGo\u2019s rise underscores the growing institutional hunger for secure, compliant infrastructure. The California-based firm now holds $100B in digital assets, a 66% increase from $60B at the start of the year. Much of that growth comes from increased demand for staking services (which now account for half of its holdings) and from a rising tide of institutional adoption. BitGo also expanded into South Korea in 2024 and Dubai in 2025, further building on an already powerful foundation in its aim to become more competitive in the industry. In contrast, Polymarket\u2019s trajectory highlights the viral growth of speculative, user-driven DeFi applications. The platform, known for letting users bet on everything from elections to sports outcomes, surged in popularity during the 2024 U.S. presidential cycle, processing over $3.3B in bets. Now, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund is reportedly leading a $200M funding round, positioning Polymarket to become a unicorn asset And this immediately after Polymarket announced a partnership with X. The timing is perfect: there&#8217;s a strong appetite for decentralized markets offering high-risk, high-reward plays. Confidence on Two Fronts These contrasting success stories reveal a broader truth: crypto is no longer a monolith. Institutional players are flocking to battle-tested custodians like BitGo, who offer the compliance and security infrastructure needed to satisfy regulators (so far, at least: BitGo remains banned in the US). Meanwhile, crypto-native projects like Polymarket are pulling a different kind of capital \u2013 Venture Capitals betting on engaging decentralized apps that leverage core blockchain values of trustless systems and open markets. Both Bitgo and Polymarket demonstrate the growing confidence in the crypto economy, and the potential lying in wait. Confidence from institutions, who now see crypto as a serious asset class, and from venture backers, who see new economic behaviors forming around blockchain-native markets. BitGo\u2019s next chapter could include a public listing by late 2025. And Polymarket is reportedly exploring a token launch \u2013 a move that could further incentivize users and decentralize governance. Interested in tapping into that same retail interest?

That\u2019s a bit unfair to the ecosystem itself, but presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors. In fact, over the past year $TRX has posted 123% gains. Those gains are fueled not only by $TRX, but by broader activity on the Tron network, including $USDT. The world\u2019s leading stablecoin ($156B market cap) is heavily traded on Tron. The demand led to a recent minting of another $2B on the network. With stablecoins increasingly in the public eye \u2013 see the recent GENIUS Act \u2013 that demand is likely to only increase. BitGo and Polymarket Demonstrate Bullish Market Corporate success with BitGo and Polymarket shows just how broad the interest in crypto actually is \u2013 from retail investors to venture capitalists. And it makes these tokens some of the best crypto to buy right now. As always, do your own research \u2013 this isn\u2019t financial advice."
