      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-next-move-hinges-on-2-35/",
      "summary": "XRP is showing mixed signals across timeframes, leaving traders on edge as the price approaches the key $2.35 level. While a recent breakout from a falling wedge on the 3-day chart suggests a bullish reversal, the 4-hour chart reveals signs of slowing momentum and a possible rising wedge. With buyers and sellers locked in a battle, $2.35 could be the tipping point that decides whether XRP surges higher or slips into a near-term correction. XRP Breaks Out Of Falling Wedge On 3-Day Chart In an X post, LSplayQ highlighted a key technical development on the XRP 3-day price chart, pointing to a breakout from a falling wedge pattern. This type of pattern is commonly associated with bullish reversals, signaling that market sentiment may be shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: XRP Silent Accumulation: A Falling Wedge On The Verge Of Explosion Following the breakout, XRP is currently trading around $2.26, and according to LSplayQ, the move suggests that buyers are stepping back in to reclaim control. The price action marks a significant shift after an extended period of downward compression within the wedge. If the bullish momentum continues, LSplayQ notes that XRP could target a breakout level near $2.72, which represents an upside potential of roughly 20% from the current price. That said, LSplayQ also warns of the risk of a pullback if XRP fails to hold above the wedge breakout level. In such a scenario, the price could retest the $2.10 zone as a potential support. Overall, the technical outlook leans bullish, as long as XRP maintains its position above the breakout level. Rising Wedge Pattern Signals Caution Ahead In a post on X, The Crypto Bushman pointed out that XRP is pushing higher on the 4-hour chart, but warned that seasoned traders are keeping a close eye on what lies beneath the surface. Related Reading: XRP Price Pops and Drops \u2014 Can Bulls Regain Control? According to the analyst, the price is currently trading above both the 20- and 50-day EMAs, which typically signals short-term strength. However, the overall structure appears to be forming a rising wedge, a pattern often linked to potential reversals. At the same time, momentum is beginning to fade, with the MACD flattening and volume tapering off, which Bushman describes as classic signs of a potential trap move. The Crypto Bushman emphasized that a failure to break cleanly above $2.35 could lead to the setup rolling over. In that case, the $2.25 zone becomes a critical level to watch for a possible breakdown and shift in sentiment. On the flip side, a strong breakout backed by volume could fuel another leg up toward $2.50 if buying pressure returns decisively. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

That kind of speed appeals to big investors, who want clarity and a clear audit trail. This push into tokenized finance shows a shift in how big firms manage money.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/2025-biggest-bitcoin-bull-trigger-still-hidden/",
      "summary": "In a conversation with The Bitcoin Economy podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart argued that the next, and potentially largest, leg of institutional demand for spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds will not come from pension funds, endowments, or sovereign wealth managers. Instead, it will arise when the country\u2019s fragmented network of registered investment advisers (RIAs) finally gains full discretionary clearance to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to ordinary clients. \u201cThe biggest bull case for the ETFs has been the unlocking of RIAs in 2025,\u201d Seyffart said. \u201cRight now the vast majority of the assets are stuck in that middle ground where, if a client specifically asks to buy a Bitcoin ETF, the adviser can act\u2014but the adviser cannot initiate the recommendation.\u201d The Biggest Bull Case For Bitcoin In 2025 Seyffart broke the compliance bottleneck into a traffic-light schema that most financial advisers will recognise. A red-light firm bars Bitcoin entirely; a yellow-light firm permits unsolicited purchases (\u201cIf you come to me and ask for it, I can do it\u201d); and a green-light firm allows the adviser to solicit an allocation (\u201cI can recommend that you put two percent of your portfolio in Bitcoin\u201d). Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut\u2014What You Need To Know Wire-house broker\u2013dealers\u2014which still custody trillions of dollars\u2014largely remain in the red or yellow camps, paralysed by multi-year due-diligence committees. Independent RIAs, by contrast, \u201cwere the early adopters,\u201d Seyffart noted, because they \u201cdon\u2019t have to wait for a due-diligence team of a bunch of people sitting in New York.\u201d Yet even among independents, most advisers outsource portfolio construction to centralised model portfolios; until those models flag Bitcoin ETFs as eligible holdings, discretionary uptake will stay muted. Seyffart\u2019s focus on 2025 is calendrical, not calendrical: the first full-calendar year after launch gives compliance teams twelve months of daily NAV history\u2014often a hard requirement before a new ETF can graduate from yellow to green status. \u201cUsually it can take two to three years before an ETF gets approved,\u201d he said, but the extraordinary size and liquidity of the spot-Bitcoin cohort is already accelerating that cycle. Crucially, the next Form 13F reporting deadline on 15 August 2025 will reveal second-quarter holdings as of 30 June. Seyffart expects the data to confirm that \u201ca lot more RIAs have come online and [are] buying this for their clients,\u201d providing the first concrete measure of green-light conversions. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned If the gatekeeping retreats, model-portfolio architects can incorporate Bitcoin\u2019s historically uncorrelated returns into strategic-allocation frameworks. That in turn would grant advisers legal cover to solicit Bitcoin exposure, unleashing a flywheel of inflows. Seyffart cautioned that the same compliance teams will demand iron-clad fiduciary justifications\u2014volatility, custody and tax treatment remain live concerns\u2014but he argued that the ETFs now provide a wrapper familiar to any wealth platform. Seyffart\u2019s thesis is that the moment a critical mass of compliance committees flips from yellow to green\u2014allowing advisers to recommend Bitcoin rather than merely transact it\u2014flows could dwarf everything seen to date. Whether that inflection arrives in the next 12 months will determine, in his view, \u201cthe biggest bull case for Bitcoin.\u201d At press time, BTC traded at $108,250.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/50-bitcoin-price-crash-60000/",
      "summary": "Despite the Bitcoin price holding up quite nicely above $100,000 and remaining very close to its all-time high levels, there continues to be expectations of a massive crash that would rock the market. Pseudonymous crypto analyst FriendlyRox points to a number of indicators for this, going from volume to momentum, all pointing to a possible price crash. What is the expected result of this? Losing the $100,000 psychological level and then falling to previous peaks. Bitcoin Price At Risk With Dwindling Volume And Momentum In the analysis, FriendlyRox highlighted the decline in major metrics such as momentum and volume as the major driver of the forecasted price crash. This comes amid bullish news dominating the headlines, such as institutions increasing their Bitcoin holdings and supply on exchanges falling toward new lows, meaning investors are choosing to hold for higher prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Explosive Breakout: $5,791 The Minimum Target\u2013Analyst The decline in the volume has been apparent after the Bitcoin price had fallen below $100,000 before bouncing back up in June. So far, in the month of July, the Bitcoin trading volumes have trended lower, with data from Coinglass showing consistent daily volumes below $100 billion. At the same time, there has also been a decline in momentum, with the analyst pointing out a negative divergence in this metric. Furthermore, the Bitcoin price has also flashed a historical trend that has usually predated market tops. This is price reaching the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and then retracing. FriendlyRox revealed that in the past, whenever the price touched the 50 EMA and then extended back, it usually signalled a crash, and the Bitcoin price has done this now, extending even further. Other metrics that have also flashed bearishness include the RSI and the MACD, both of which are now showing a loss of momentum as they moved into the negative. All of these factors happening together at the same time have painted a pretty bleak picture for the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. BTC Bottom Targets With the lineup of bearish developments, the crypto analyst has predicted an approximately 50% from here. As volume continues to decrease and momentum slides into the negative, they expect that the Bitcoin price will be looking to retrace back to the 50 EMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The interesting fact here is that the 50 EMA falls below the previous Bitcoin price peak, putting it at $60,000. A crash of this magnitude would only be rivaled by the COVID crash in 2020 and the FTX-induced market crash back in 2022. But nevertheless, it would mean a wipeout for altcoins across the board. As for the timeframe for when this could happen, there is no definite timeline. Going by the analyst\u2019s chart, it could take a couple of years for this to completely play out, with the analyst closing with: \u201cLet us see how it unfolds.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm co-founded by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has made headlines once again on Monday, but not for its usual Bitcoin acquisitions, but for its notable absence of purchases during the week of June 30 to July 6. This marks the first time since late March that the largest corporate holder of BTC has not added to its impressive treasury, which currently stands at 597,325 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $64.71 billion. Strategy Bitcoin Investment Hits A Pause The lack of activity in Bitcoin acquisitions is surprising, especially given Strategy&#8217;s aggressive purchases over the past few months. These purchases have brought the company close to holding nearly 3% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s total supply. From April 7 through June 29, the company invested $6.77 billion in acquiring 69,140 BTC, averaging about $97,906 per coin. At current market prices, these investments have appreciated by 10.4%, now worth around $7.49 billion. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 In terms of trading, Strategy&#8217;s stock (trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MSTR) saw a slight decline of 0.7% during morning trading hours, which is in line with the 0.8% drop in Bitcoin prices. As of this writing, MSTR closed the day at $395. This highlights the close relationship between the company\u2019s performance and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the company&#8217;s stock has enjoyed a rise of 38.5% in 2025, outpacing BTC\u2019s 16.1% increase and the S&#38;P 500&#8217;s modest gain of 6.1%. Up To $4.2 Billion For Future BTC Investments In addition to this pause in BTC purchases, Strategy did not issue any new common or preferred shares during the specified week. However, the company announced a sales agreement to potentially issue and sell up to $4.2 billion in 10% preferred stock. According to Monday\u2019s press release on the matter by the Bitcoin proxy firm, the proceeds from this sales agreement are earmarked for general corporate purposes, which include future BTC acquisitions and working capital needs.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,855, marking a 1.5% decline within the last 24 hours, increasing the gap between the current price and its record by 3.5%. This follows a failed attempt last week to overcome the cryptocurrency&#8217;s most significant resistance level of $110,000 and establish a new all-time high above its current record of $111,800.
