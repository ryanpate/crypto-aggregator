The top cryptocurrency is hinting at further profits, as the Bitcoin price crosses a new all time high and the much awaited altcoin season approaches. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading At the time of writing, Cardano trades at $0.74 with a 18% profit over the past 24 hours. On higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency records a 28% profit followed by XRP\u2019s 20% gains over the same period. ADA's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Analyst Says Cardano Will Replicate a Historical Bull Run Unlike Ethereum and XRP, the Cardano price has been more consistent with its past performance. In that sense, analyst Ali Martinez pointed to the formation of a bullish pattern for ADA that could propel the digital asset above the critical level around $1. The analyst claims that the $0.55 support for Cardano has been a key support on high timeframes. The last time the cryptocurrency dropped to this level in April this year, as seen on the chart below, ADA was able to rise to over 55% and touched the $0.85 mark. \u2018It\u2019s happening again\u2019 said Martinez while pointing at the bullish momentum driving Cardano since it touched the bottom of this parallel channel. If the cryptocurrency can sustain this drive, it is likely to touch its May highs before meeting critical resistance.

Source: Ali Martinez via X ADA Could Trend Even Higher, Bullish Price Targets A separate analyst also took note of the Cardano price action and the way it seems to be mirroring past patterns. The analyst claims that Cardano is entering a critical breakout zone. However, unlike Martinez, the analyst is more bullish and believes the ADA price might rally as much as 212% over the coming weeks. The analyst placed a bullish price target for the Cardano price at around $1.7. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape The analyst stated the following while sharing the chart below: $ADA is now testing the 50-week EMA. The last 2 times it crossed this line, it went up 212% and 128%. If history repeats, we will be looking at $1.77 $ADA. Are you ready for the pump? Cardano price to enter the $1 area over the next few weeks. Source: MinswapIntern via X In the long term, the analyst expects to see ADA hit $5 driven by its recent announcements, including a partnership with Tx Pipe to accelerate developer growth in Argentina that is set to benefit the Cardano ecosystem. On this partnership, Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO, said: Their team represents the best of what Argentina\u2019s developer community has to offer, and together we are building a foundation for long-term ecosystem growth.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/chainlink-uptrend-weakening/",
      "summary": "Sharing fresh insights on X, Crypto Analysis AI observed that Chainlink is maintaining its upward trajectory, but not without signs of fading strength, identifying $14.20 as a key level to watch. Holding above this level could preserve the bullish structure, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper pullback. Mixed Signals In Focus: Chainlink Short-Term Strength Vs. Medium-Term Caution According to Crypto Analysis AI, LINK/USDT is currently showing mixed signals, with a slight bullish bias in the short term but potential consolidation or pullback risks in the medium term. The 1H timeframe shows more buy signals, while the 4H timeframe indicates weakening momentum after a strong uptrend. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support \u2013 Bulls Eye $20 Range In the 1H timeframe, the following bullish signals are active: ADX (35.47, strong trend), EMA (EMA9 &#62; EMA20), KDJ (buy), ICHIMOKU (buy), and TRIX (buy). At the same time, several indicators are flashing bearish signals, including MACD (histogram negative), PSAR (sell), and Keltner Channels (sell). Some metrics remain neutral, with RSI at 57.60 (not overbought) and OBV showing neutral. For the 4H timeframe, bullish signals include ADX (34.17, strong trend), MACD (positive histogram), and Supertrend (buy). However, KDJ (sell), SMI (sell), and Schaff Trend Cycle (overbought) are signaling possible weakness. RSI at 66.94 (nearing overbought) and neutral OBV further support a cautious medium-term view, which increases the risk of a pullback. Key Observations from Crypto Analysis AI note that short-term momentum favors bulls. However, medium-term indicators suggest exhaustion, pointing to the 4H RSI reading. Fluctuations And Consolidation Signal Caution Crypto Analysis AI reports that the current trend for Chainlink remains an uptrend, but is slowing. Looking at recent price action, Crypto Analysis AI observed that on the 1H timeframe, LINK fluctuated between $14.25 and $14.48, closing at $14.34. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move Holds The Key Meanwhile, on the 4H chart, there was a strong rally from $13.50 to $14.49, which is now consolidating near $14.30 and $14.40. The analyst also mentioned that volume is declining in the recent 1H candles, which suggests weakening momentum. Crypto Analysis AI identified the following key resistance levels: $14.48 (recent high) and $14.65 (upper Bollinger Band, 1H). In terms of key support, he pointed out $14.20 (recent swing low, 4H), followed by $13.90-$14.00 (psychological support, 4H EMA20) and $13.50 (strong support, previous breakout zone). Outlining potential bullish scenarios, Crypto Analysis AI explained that if LINK holds above $14.20, it could retest $14.48 and $14.65. In a bearish scenario, a break below $14.20 may lead to a deeper correction toward $13.90-$14.00. Meanwhile, for a neutral scenario, Chainlink may continue to consolidate between $14.20 and $14.48 before the next directional move. Finally, Crypto Analysis AI flagged several cautionary signals: 4H RSI near 67 could trigger profit-taking while the MACD histogram is declining despite higher highs. Furthermore, there is lower volume on recent up moves, suggesting weakening demand. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-mvrv-oscillator-predicts-first-sell-pressure-level-at-130900-details/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has officially broken through its previous all-time high of $112,000, surging to $118,000 just hours ago and entering uncharted territory for the first time since late May. The breakout confirms bullish momentum after weeks of consolidation and failed attempts, with price action now showing clear strength. With the psychological and technical barrier of $112K cleared, many analysts believe this move could mark the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s next expansive rally. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level \u2013 Relief Or Reversal? Bulls are firmly in control, and on-chain metrics support this breakout narrative. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands currently stand at 2.25. Historically, Bitcoin enters the overheated zone around 3.0 or higher, suggesting there is still room for growth before reaching excessive valuation territory. This metric, which measures the deviation between market price and realized value, helps identify when BTC is overbought or undervalued relative to past performance. At current levels, the data points to continued upside potential without major overheating concerns, fueling confidence that this breakout could extend further. Bitcoin Enters Expansion Phase As Market Eyes $130K After weeks of tight consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, signaling the start of a new market phase. The breakout above previous highs has reignited investor optimism, not only for BTC but also for the broader altcoin market, with many altcoins now pushing above key resistance levels for the first time in months. This move comes amid growing anticipation of a weakening US dollar and renewed inflationary pressures as Washington adopts looser fiscal policies. The market is increasingly pricing in the effects of tax cuts, high government spending, and dovish political rhetoric\u2014all of which create a favorable environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. Still, the macro backdrop is not without risks. US Treasury yields remain elevated, flashing warnings of underlying systemic stress in credit markets. This tension underscores the fragility of the current rally and the importance of monitoring fundamental shifts. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights using the MVRV oscillator, a model that compares Bitcoin\u2019s market value to its realized value. According to Adler, historical data over the last four years suggests that when MVRV reaches 2.75, Bitcoin tends to face its first wave of meaningful selling pressure. If the same pattern holds true in this cycle, Bitcoin could reach approximately $130,900 before seeing notable profit-taking activity. While the current MVRV reading remains below that threshold, the model offers a clear signal of where long-term holders may begin offloading. Until then, the breakout sets the stage for a potential leg higher, with bulls now in control, pushing toward price discovery and a possible test of the $130K zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason BTC Enters Uncharted Territory With Strong Momentum Bitcoin has officially broken into price discovery after blasting through its all-time high resistance near $112,000. The 3-day chart shows a massive bullish candle pushing BTC up to $118,683, representing an 8.94% gain in the last session. This breakout is the first clear sign of a strong bullish continuation after weeks of sideways consolidation below key resistance. The chart highlights a textbook breakout structure. BTC respected the $103,600 and $109,300 support zones multiple times throughout May and June before finally gaining enough momentum to pierce through the upper resistance. The recent surge came with a noticeable spike in volume, adding confidence to the breakout\u2019s sustainability. Moving averages also confirm the bullish trend. The 50, 100, and 200 SMA lines remain aligned upward with increasing separation, suggesting that market structure remains strong and trend continuation is likely. Bitcoin is now trading well above all major moving averages, reinforcing the strength of the rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops \u2013 Bullish Setup Takes Shape With no historical resistance levels above, BTC enters a price discovery phase. The next psychological target for bulls will likely be $120,000, followed by the MVRV-based resistance level around $130,900. As long as BTC holds above $112K, the momentum remains decisively in favor of the bulls. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s up nearly 8.5% this week, approaching $120K and clocking over $123B in 24h volume. But now, the real volatility (and upside) is rotating into the best altcoins. Traders are chasing faster gains down the cap table (memes, AI tokens, new L1s), and Kraken\u2019s making those trades easier to find and execute. If you\u2019re looking for what\u2019s next, not what already happened, Kraken\u2019s where you start. Altcoin Rotation Is Heating Up Bitcoin&#8217;s ripping, but Ethereum\u2019s catching up fast. $ETH is up over 17% this week and now flirting with the $3K mark. Historically, when $ETH gains momentum, the altcoin floodgates tend to open, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. BTC dominance is also slipping below 65%, a key signal that traders are rotating into higher-beta plays. On Kraken, it\u2019s not just the best meme coins flying. In the past 24 hours, Omni ($OMNI) pumped +174%, Matchain ($MAT) +66%, and Dolomite ($DOLO) +53.35%. Even coins like Renzo ($REX), Initia ($INIT), and Unicorn Fart Dust ($UFD) are putting up 30\u201350% days. With many low-cap, high-velocity tokens, Kraken gives you the first shot at these rotations before the crowd catches on. Kraken Moves with the Market In the past three days alone, Kraken has listed $HBAR, $TANSSI, and $EPT. These additions align perfectly with what traders are rotating into: AI, Layer 2 (L2) infrastructure, and real-world asset plays. That speed and narrative alignment isn\u2019t a fluke. Kraken just climbed to #2 globally in Kaiko\u2019s Q2 2025 Exchange Rankings, a data-driven benchmark that weighs market quality, regulatory strength, liquidity, and transparency. Kraken scored high across the board, particularly on depth and execution reliability \u2013 two pillars that matter most when chasing volatile small caps. For traders trying to stay in sync with the flow of capital, Kraken is a front-row seat to what\u2019s next. Built for the Way You Trade Altcoins Catching altcoin moves isn\u2019t just about spotting the right tokens. It\u2019s about having the tools to act on them fast. With 452+ listed assets, Kraken exposes you to everything from the best low-cap coins to AI, L2s, and real-world asset plays, all in one place. Kraken lets you buy instantly using bank transfers, cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PayPal. So you\u2019re never stuck on the sidelines when the market starts moving. You can go long on a momentum play, hedge it with 300+ derivatives, or stake your bags across 20+ supported assets, including newer staking listings like $SUI. Need flexibility? Kraken offers up to 5x margin and consistently deep liquidity, with 88% of 2024 orders filling at the top of the book, minimizing slippage when every second counts. For altcoin traders also tracking macro trends, Kraken\u2019s xStocks expansion brings tokenized equities like TSLA, AAPL, and SPY into play, bridging TradFi and crypto in real time. Alt Season Needs a Platform Bitcoin lit the fuse, but the real action is in altcoins. With capital rotating fast and new narratives popping up daily, you need a platform that keeps up. Kraken&#8217;s deep listings, fast access to new tokens, and pro-grade trading tools give you everything you need to execute quickly and confidently when a window opens.

      "summary": "Dogecoin hovered near $0.20 on Friday, nursing a weekly gain of about 17 percent and a 24-hour trading volume above $2 billion as traders digested a late-June livestream by technical analyst Kevin, who argued that the meme-coin\u2019s structure \u201chas to be one of the best-looking altcoin charts out there.\u201d Dogecoin Double Bottom Could Trigger $1 During the one-hour session Kevin highlighted a textbook double-bottom that printed on Dogecoin\u2019s weekly chart exactly at the confluence of the 200-week simple and exponential moving averages, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the 2023\u20132025 advance, and a long-term up-trend line dating back to the 2022 bear-market trough. Entering at that zone, he said, \u201cthe risk-reward here is phenomenal,\u201d noting that a tight stop just below the cluster implied limited downside while upside targets stretched toward the previous cycle\u2019s highs. Kevin told viewers the weekly momentum profile supports a larger breakout. Money-flow on Market Cipher is curling higher for the first time in more than a year; the MACD is preparing to cross bullish from a higher low; and the stochastic RSI has turned up from mid-range. On the monthly chart, relative strength continues to print higher highs and higher lows, and the stock-RSI \u201cis hanging on, ready to push back up,\u201d he said, adding that the entire structure \u201clooks freakin\u2019 great\u201d for a sustained move once Bitcoin clears its own resistance band near $116,000.

He stopped short of offering an end-of-cycle target, but insisted \u201c$1 remains likely,\u201d conditional on Bitcoin extending toward the $150,000 region and\u2014crucially\u2014on macro tail-winds such as an end to quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. Even so, Kevin warned against complacency. Dogecoin\u2019s intraday spike coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s test of a major Fib cluster at $116,000, while USDT dominance hit golden-pocket support\u2014levels that could spark a near-term cooldown. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by green candles,\u201d he said, reminding viewers that meme-coins \u201ccan get crushed even in bull markets\u201d and advising strict risk management: take partial profits after big thrusts, move stops to break-even, and \u201crinse and repeat.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Beyond pure chart work, Kevin framed Dogecoin as a perpetual beneficiary of retail psychology. \u201cYou can walk into any gas station and someone owns Doge,\u201d he quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s the retail darling\u2014it always will be\u2014especially when new money shows up with deeper pockets than last time.\u201d For now, price action is validating that thesis. If the double-bottom holds and macro conditions align, the analyst argues, Dogecoin could once again headline the next alt-season\u2014this time with a dollar tag that traders in the last cycle could only meme about. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1978. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
