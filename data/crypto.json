      "summary": "Amid the Trump-Musk online feud, Bitcoin (BTC) has hovered within the mid-and-low areas of its local price range, hitting a one-month low near the $100,000 support. However, some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for the \u201creal\u201d price jump toward a new all-time high (ATH) Related Reading: SUI Rally At Risk? Analysts Warn Of 30% Dip If This Level Doesn\u2019t Hold Bitcoin Prepares For \u2018Real Breakout\u2019 Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin experienced significant volatility fueled by the online feud between US President Donald Trump and Tesla and X owner Elon Musk. The flagship crypto\u2019s price took a beating on Thursday afternoon after dropping by over 5% from the $105,000 level to the $100,000 support. Before the pullback, BTC had been attempting to reclaim its local mid-range area after its recent performance. Notably, the cryptocurrency traded sideways following its ATH rally to $111,980, hovering between the $106,800 and $109,700 price range. However, the cryptocurrency lost the key $106,800 support amid last week\u2019s market retracement, which saw Bitcoin drop to $102,000 over the weekend. Since then, BTC has been attempting to reclaim the current levels. After yesterday\u2019s drop, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has surged 4.5%, climbing above the $104,000 level. Crypto trader Coinvo highlighted BTC\u2019s one-year chart, pointing to the similarly looking price action between 2024 and 2025. According to the chart, Bitcoin recorded its first major pump after reclaiming its yearly opening level, consolidating within its new range for weeks before climbing to its Q1 2024 ATH. This year, the cryptocurrency has had a similar performance, although delayed, having reclaimed the yearly opening range and surging to the first major price surge in May. Similarly, analyst Alex Clay suggested that Bitcoin is preparing for the \u201creal breakout\u201d following its retests of the range\u2019s mid-zone resistance in Q1 2025 and a \u201cfalse\u201d breakout last month. To the analyst, \u201cWe grabbed the liquidity below the Broken Supply Zone. Now looking for a Real Breakout\u201d toward the $120,000 mark. BTC Price To Range For Two Weeks? The Cryptonomist noted that Bitcoin displays a 3-week bullish falling wedge formation, with the lower boundary sitting around the $101,000 level. Following the recent price drop, BTC bounced from that area, and could break out of the pattern if it reclaims the $105,000 barrier as support, targeting the $118,000-$120,000 levels. Meanwhile, market watcher Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that its price now trades at the mid-range again, near the Monthly opening price. To the trader, \u201cit&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that these range high/lows are good triggers for whatever larger trend follows,\u201d as BTC has been having a \u201crelatively large move early in the month.\u201d As he previously explained, Bitcoin tends to set its monthly high or low during the first week of the month, followed by a reversal in the opposite direction and a trend continuation until a new month begins. Based on this, he warned that if the price drops below yesterday\u2019s lows, it will continue to trend down for another week or two, displaying \u201cweakness and confirming a larger correction is due.\u201d Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes 15% Move Amid Key Resistance Retest \u2013 Breakout Or Rejection Next? Nonetheless, if price surges above the monthly highs, around the $106,700 mark, \u201cthe correction is more likely to be over and there&#8217;s a good likelihood that we head to all-time highs and beyond.\u201d \u201cGood chance we range around this area for a while, though, without any of these levels breaking,\u201d he concluded.

      "summary": "Data shows the cryptocurrency sector has seen a large amount of liquidations following the volatility that Bitcoin and others have gone through in the past day. Bitcoin Has Seen A Rollercoaster Over The Last 24 Hours The past day has been a wild time for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole as prices have displayed some notable volatility. BTC, especially, has gone through quite the rollercoaster, with its price seeing swings in both the up and down direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30\u2014Is A New All-Time High Next? Below is a chart that shows how the recent price action has looked for the number one digital asset. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin price first went down to a low of $100,400 from a high around $105,800 and then witnessed a recovery run back to $104,100. The coin is still overall down during the past day, but its loss stands at less than 2%. The other cryptocurrencies haven&#8217;t been so lucky, as their prices haven&#8217;t quite retraced to the same degree. Ethereum is still down almost 6% and Dogecoin about 7%. The volatile storm in the sector has come following a public feud between US President Donald Trump and Tesla founder Elon Musk. The spat began when the former said in an Oval Office meeting that he was &#8216;disappointed&#8217; in the latter over his criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Musk had previously called the bill a &#8216;disgusting abomination.&#8217; The two let sparks fly on social media, with the SpaceX founder even accusing the President of being in the Epstein files. &#8220;That is the real reason they have not been made public,&#8221; said Musk in an X post. Crypto Liquidations Have Neared A Billion With all the volatility that has gripped Bitcoin and company during the past day, it&#8217;s only to be expected that the derivatives market would feel the impact. According to data from CoinGlass, a mass amount of liquidations have piled up on the various centralized exchanges. &#8220;Liquidation&#8221; here naturally refers to the forceful closure that any open contract has to go through if it amasses losses of a certain percentage. As displayed in the table, the cryptocurrency market has seen liquidations amounting to a whopping $970 million over the last 24 hours. Out of these, a staggering $854 million, representing 88% of the total, came from the long investors alone. This is naturally down to the fact that prices as a whole have gone down during this window. Related Reading: Solana\u2019s Old Hands Are Moving\u2014Is Trouble Brewing? Like usual, Bitcoin and Ethereum have led the sector in liquidations, contributing $346 million and $286 million, respectively.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-recovers-from-100k-dip-while-on-chain-data-shows-rising-miner-activity/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is showing signs of recovery after a brief but sharp dip triggered by recent market turbulence linked to public tensions between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The price of BTC had dropped to nearly $100,000 during the height of the reaction, but has since rebounded. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,891, marking a steady recovery from the 24-hour low. While the broader crypto market continues to digest the fallout, new data suggests that another force, miner activity, is beginning to shape the near-term outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback or Setup? On-Chain Metrics Hint at What\u2019s Coming Next Bitcoin Surge in Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action According to on-chain analytics published by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the volume of BTC transferred to exchanges. Between May 19 and May 28, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day, levels not seen in previous market cycles. These inflows are often viewed as a proxy for miners&#8217; intent to sell, which could influence short-term supply dynamics and introduce added volatility to BTC\u2019s spot market performance. The rise in realized inflows from miners to exchanges is interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Since miners are key liquidity providers in the Bitcoin ecosystem, large-scale transfers to exchanges are typically seen as preparations to offload BTC. Historically, spikes in miner outflows have preceded periods of downward price pressure, particularly when they occur alongside fragile market conditions. CryptoOnchain emphasizes that while miner selling isn\u2019t inherently negative, it can impact short-term price stability. As a result, traders and investors often monitor these flows to better assess potential risks. When miner inflows surge, it reflects the sector\u2019s sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. CryptoOnchain noted: Paying close attention to these inflows\u2014especially during historical peaks like the current phase\u2014can help with risk management and more informed trading decisions. Hash Ribbon Signal Suggests Longer-Term Opportunity Amid rising sell pressure, another indicator is flashing a potential opportunity. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost noted that Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Ribbons indicator, a metric derived from comparing 30-day and 60-day moving averages of network hashrate, has recently produced a new buy signal. This metric is used to evaluate miner stress and recovery phases, and is generally interpreted as a signal that miners have gone through a period of capitulation and are now stabilizing or recovering. This signal has historically aligned with favorable long-term entry points, except in unique events like China\u2019s 2021 mining ban. While the short-term effects of mining stress may contribute to price weakness, analysts suggest that these periods often set the stage for longer-term rallies. When miner capitulation resolves, it can clear excess supply from the market and establish stronger support levels. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Bitcoin found its footing and climbed back to $104,400 by the time this report was filed. According to a recent analysis by crypto researcher Klarch, this pullback was expected and might just be a pit stop before another run to fresh highs. Recurring Cycle Patterns Based on examination by Klarch, Bitcoin tends to follow a familiar path after each halving. One year after the 2016 halving, it rose about 280%. After the 2020 halving, it jumped roughly 550% in 367 days. Right now, Bitcoin has only moved up around 70% in the 416 days since the last halving. Klarch points out that in past cycles, these numbers picked up speed after a slow start. So, he says, there\u2019s still room for more growth. Bitcoin cycles are identical&#8230; &#8211; In 2016, $BTC grew by 280%, 365 days after Halving &#8211; In 2020, $BTC grew by 550%, 367 days after Halving &#8211; Now, 416 days post-Halving, $BTC +70% \u2014 growth ahead&#8230; History repeats, here\u2019s $BTC\u2019s near future\ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/wshX4egwbC \u2014 Klarck (@0xklarck) June 5, 2025 These percentages matter because they hint at what might come next. If Bitcoin\u2019s history repeats, the best gains could be just around the corner. Information from blockchain data supports this too. For example, trading volume and on-chain addresses hit new highs in recent weeks. That fits the pattern Klarch described\u2014after the initial rise, there\u2019s often a bigger rally. Signs Of The Next Surge Bitcoin set a record of $112,100 on January 20, then edged up to $111,980 on May 22. Rather than signaling an end, Klarch believes these milestones mark the start of a higher peak. He sees those moves as part of the cycle\u2019s build-up, not its climax. Based on his chart work, each cycle has multiple tops before it finally tops out. Klarch didn\u2019t offer an exact date for a new peak, but he did suggest that Bitcoin has not yet hit its ceiling. He notes that a series of all-time highs usually happens when sentiment is still turning positive. Once more traders feel FOMO, the price often accelerates rapidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market\u2014Data Demand And Liquidity Driving Price Liquidity pouring into the crypto market has been a key talking point. Klarch says that steady buys from institutions and US Bitcoin spot ETFs have made Bitcoin scarcer on exchanges. Michael Saylor&#8217;s Strategy and other big money players keep buying, which pushes supply lower. Based on figures presented by Klarch, this trend could lift Bitcoin to around $180,000\u2014a rise of about 75% from current levels. VanEck, an asset manager, has shared a similar target. That makes Klarch\u2019s outlook feel less like a lone voice. If big funds keep moving in and retail interest stays high, Bitcoin\u2019s price might stay on the upswing. However, any pause in ETF inflows or a sudden shift in global markets could change that story. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Crypto Insight UK has doubled down on a forecast that XRP must endure one last, violent shakeout before launching toward a long-awaited $10 milestone. In his latest video, the British analyst warned that \u201cthe most dense liquidity I\u2019ve seen in a long time for XRP\u201d still sits uncollected beneath current spot prices. Until that pool is swept, he argues, the market will not unlock the upside move he ultimately expects to carry the token into double-digit territory. XRP Needs One Last Flush \u201cXRP didn\u2019t come down as low as we wanted,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cIt did hit the first key area of liquidity, but it didn\u2019t take it all. That makes me think we\u2019ve got continued downside.\u201d In his own trading plan, the analyst has resting bids at roughly $2.01 and $1.95\u2014a zone he believes will be tested once leveraged longs capitulate. Only after that \u201cfinal flush,\u201d he contends, can a rally toward $10 begin in earnest. The call comes amid broader cross-asset strength that has so far failed to translate into a sustained altcoin breakout. Silver is challenging decade-old highs near $36 an ounce, uranium contracts are pressing their recent peaks, and the Nasdaq Composite remains within sight of its all-time high. Yet despite what he calls \u201ca broad-based commodities rally,\u201d the analyst maintains that crypto still needs one more washout to clear residual excess. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? Macro-political drama, he suggests, is only accelerating that process. He cited the public clash between Elon Musk and US president Donald Trump\u2014sparked by Trump\u2019s proposal for a four-trillion-dollar spending bill and Musk\u2019s claim that Trump\u2019s name appears in sealed Epstein files\u2014as a narrative that briefly rattled risk markets. \u201cIf it brings the price to where I want it to go, fantastic,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019re looking at here.\u201d On Ethereum he sees a similar dynamic. Open interest in ETH futures remains at all-time highs, a sign in his view that institutions are accumulating spot while shorting derivatives to hedge\u2014a trade that could unwind violently should ETH pierce the $2,800 level. \u201cWhen we get this squeeze to the upside,\u201d he predicted, \u201cwe\u2019ll see a fast move back toward all-time highs for ETH, probably toward $4,500 before you know it.\u201d Related Reading: The Worst Case For XRP This Cycle? Just A Giga Rally To $19, Says Analyst Bitcoin, for its part, has already waded into the analyst\u2019s preferred liquidity zone just above $100,000. Whether the flagship asset needs another dip, he said, is less important than what happens to its dominance. A brief surge in bitcoin market share toward 65.5% would, in his model, coincide with an XRP capitulation and set the stage for \u201ccrazy season,\u201d his shorthand for a full-blown altcoin cycle. The hinge is XRP liquidity. Viewers were shown heat-map snapshots highlighting concentrated stop-loss orders beneath the May swing low. \u201cPeople came long here after they thought, \u2018Oh, the bottom\u2019s in.\u2019 That\u2019s added to this liquidity below us,\u201d he said. Until that layer is removed, he remains \u201c80% sure\u201d that price will probe lower\u2014even though his own portfolio is almost entirely in spot XRP. \u201cI\u2019m on the side of wanting it to go,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cIf it goes up now, I\u2019m happy. But I\u2019d be highly surprised if we don\u2019t get that push down.\u201d Still, his end-point is unequivocally bullish. Once the liquidity has been harvested, he foresees a textbook bullish divergence on the daily relative-strength index\u2014\u201clower low on price, higher low on RSI\u201d\u2014that would ignite what he calls the \u201cnext big push.\u201d In that scenario, XRP would not merely revisit its 2021 peak near $3.80; it would overshoot to the analyst\u2019s long-standing $10 target. \u201cLet it send,\u201d he concluded. At press time, XRP traded at $2.17. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
