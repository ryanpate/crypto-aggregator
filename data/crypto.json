      "summary": "Crypto Sat recently took to X to share a technical insight on Dogecoin, revealing that the asset is showing signs of accumulation following a sharp correction. According to the analyst, the 2-hour chart is beginning to shape a potential double bottom pattern. Should this structure be confirmed, it might signal a renewed upward push for DOGE, catching the interest of short-term traders and long-term holders. Make-or-Break Moment For Dogecoin: The Neckline Battle Ahead Dogecoin is currently displaying the characteristics of a double bottom formation, a classic reversal setup that could signal a shift in momentum, as noted by Crypto Sat. The first bottom was established around the $0.170 mark, following a significant price drop, where buyers initially stepped in to defend the zone. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level\u2014Or Risk A 30% Price Crash Shortly after, DOGE made a move back down for a second test of the same support area, with a higher low structure forming, suggesting weakening bearish pressure and the emergence of early accumulation. The key area to watch is the neckline resistance, which sits in the $0.198 to $0.200 range. Crypto Sat emphasizes that a breakout above the neckline would serve as strong technical confirmation of a shift in market sentiment. If bulls manage to push through, it might open the door for a sustained upward rally, as traders gain confidence in the reversal setup taking hold. Here Are Key Signals To Watch In the analysis, Crypto Sat has outlined several key signals to watch as Dogecoin&#8217;s price action tightens. One early bullish sign, he notes, is the rising volume on the second bottom, a subtle but important clue that buyers may be stepping in with growing conviction. Volume often leads price, and this uptick could mark the start of renewed upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant\u2014What\u2019s The Target? The crucial level to monitor is the resistance zone around $0.200. A strong breakout above this zone could trigger a technical shift, paving the way for a potential rally toward the $0.220 and $0.230 range. Such a move would confirm the double bottom formation and likely attract more bullish participation as confidence builds. However, if price fails to break through the neckline, support around $0.165 becomes the next critical level. A bounce from that zone would keep the pattern alive, but a clean drop below it could invalidate the setup and suggest further downside risk. Sharing his personal outlook, Crypto Sat believes DOGE may be positioning for a breakout, but cautions traders to be patient. &#8220;Let the neckline decide the next big move,&#8221; he advises, underscoring the importance of watching for confirmation before making aggressive plays.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-dominance-above-64/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Daan Crypto has provided an analysis of the rising Bitcoin dominance, explaining why this will likely continue to surge. Based on his analysis, the altcoin season is unlikely to come anytime soon, with many alts suffering significant selling pressure while BTC accumulation increases. Bitcoin Dominance Surge Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season In an X post, Daan Crypto stated that the Bitcoin Dominance shows no signs of stopping following the latest surge above 64%. He indicated that the dominance will only continue to rise as more treasury companies try to accumulate Bitcoin. Meanwhile, on the other hand, hopes of an altcoin season fade away as many altcoins are plagued with big unlocks and downtrending momentum. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises Daan Crypto also alluded to how there was a short squeeze last month on Ethereum, which took a lot of coins with it. However, this momentum quickly faded afterwards, again dashing hopes of an altcoin season. The analyst explained that there wasn\u2019t sufficient spot bid to bid most of these coins up further. Meanwhile, he cautioned market participants to pick their altcoin investments wisely. Daan Crypto remarked that most of them will underperform BTC over a larger timeframe. His warning suggests that the Bitcoin dominance will continue to trend upwards while an altcoin season may not happen anytime soon. Basically, there is a lack of interest and capital in these altcoins to spark an altcoin season, which could see them outperform BTC. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin dominance is surging thanks to massive adoption from institutional investors. These companies are looking to adopt Strategy\u2019s playbook or gain exposure through the Bitcoin ETFs. BlockchainCenter data shows that it is still Bitcoin season and nowhere near altcoin season. For it to be altcoin season, 75% of the top 50 coins need to have outperformed BTC over the last 90 days. Only ten altcoins have outperformed the flagship crypto during this period. Altseason Is Still Coming, But Slowly In an X post, crypto analyst Astronomer assured that the altcoin season is still coming, although it could take a while. He noted that the price remains the same for these altcoins, but declared that nothing has changed. The analyst remarked that this lines up with the overall plan of the Bitcoin price ranging till the end of June and altcoins remaining in their local ranges. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Astronomer also indicated that BTC needs to break out while the Bitcoin dominance remains below 65% for all parts of the plan for an altcoin season to be completed. The analyst urged market participants to be patient, expressing his confidence that an altcoin season would still occur. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $107,300, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

The plan is to store both coins in direct custody, meaning the ETF will actually hold the digital tokens rather than futures contracts or other derivatives. Crypto.com Handles Custody And Staking Based on reports, Crypto.com will serve as the ETF\u2019s sole custodian and prime execution agent.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-complete-right-shoulder-before-takeoff-how-low/",
      "summary": "XRP bulls appear to be facing one last test of conviction before the market\u2019s next explosive phase, according to CryptoInsightUK\u2019s video analysis released on 16 June. The British analyst argues that the token is sculpting an inverse head-and-shoulders formation whose right shoulder \u201cstill needs to form around the high-$1.80s\u201d before any sustained rally can commence. How Low Must XRP Go? In the broadcast, he emphasised that \u201cdense liquidity is below us,\u201d pointing to a confluence of resting bids and stop-loss clusters between roughly $1.92 and $1.80. \u201cI still think it comes down to make the right shoulder which is around 1.88,\u201d he said, adding that a swift wash-out into that pocket would \u201cflush the lows, tap in there and send it.\u201d At present, XRP is changing hands near $2.24, up about 3% over the past 24 hours, which implies a prospective drawdown of roughly 20% if the market fulfills his downside scenario. From the analyst\u2019s vantage point, such a retreat is less a cause for alarm than a prerequisite for the next major leg higher: \u201cIf we come down first, we\u2019ve done the downside part. Otherwise I\u2019m still going to be worried about going down even if we come up to $2.42 or higher.\u201d Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT\u2019s Volume? He linked the bearish short-term bias to structural forces beyond the XRP Ledger\u2019s ecosystem. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, has crept toward a historical inflection zone that previously triggered alt-seasons: \u201cAnywhere in this box could be the start of alt-season\u2026 That would probably coincide with Bitcoin dropping to between $100,000 and $93,000.\u201d A dominance spike fed by a late-cycle Bitcoin dip, he argued, would typically inflict outsized percentage losses on major altcoins\u2014including XRP\u2014before liquidity rotates back into them. Within XRP\u2019s own order book, CryptoInsightUK highlighted a \u201cliquidity vacuum\u201d created by May\u2019s capitulation candle. Although the token has since retraced most of that single-session collapse, he described the rebound as \u201cchoppy corrective price action,\u201d lacking the conviction and volume that accompanied earlier impulse waves. The right-shoulder flush, in his view, would neutralise residual leverage, particularly among traders who re-loaded longs too aggressively during the $2.15\u2013$2.40 bounce. How High Can XRP Explode? The inverse head-and-shoulders thesis also features prominently on his long-range chart, stretching back to mid-May. The analyst first published the pattern on X, showing a left shoulder near $2.42, a head at $1.47, and a neckline just above $2.50. Completing a symmetrical right shoulder near $1.88 would, by classical pattern-measuring rules, project an upside target above $3.50\u2014a level not visited since late-2021\u2019s cycle top. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP? Analyst Says $8 Breakout Is \u2018Just Waiting\u2019 Liquidity dynamics across the broader market reinforce his caution. Open interest in perpetual swaps for Ether, he observed, remains \u201cas high as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d suggesting that any sudden drop in majors could spark a forced-liquidation cascade across altcoin pairs. \u201cThese people will be flushed out,\u201d he warned, calling attention to negative-funding episodes that hint at an overcrowded short base waiting to be squeezed\u2014once the final downside pocket has been filled. Despite the near-term jitters, CryptoInsightUK reiterated a resolutely bullish macro stance. \u201cThe next stage I\u2019m most certain about is that we\u2019re going to go significantly higher for crypto,\u201d he told viewers. Drawing parallels with gold\u2019s record weekly close, he argued that an undercurrent of global risk aversion is quietly supporting non-sovereign stores of value, positioning both Bitcoin and XRP for accelerated appreciation once the technical reset concludes. For long-term holders, his advice was unequivocal: avoid wholesale portfolio shifts and instead treat any sub-$2.00 wick as a final accumulation window. \u201cDollar-cost averaging from here is a good thing to do,\u201d he said, revealing that 97% of his own capital remains in spot positions, with only a single-digit percentage reserved for surgical bids in the $1.80\u2013$1.92 zone. Whether XRP respects that script will become clear in the days ahead. Should the market indeed sweep into the high-$1.80s and rebound with the aggressive thrust the analyst expects, the right shoulder will be complete\u2014and the runway clear\u2014for the long-awaited take-off. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-crash-as-war-tensions/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price activity has been characterized by sharp swings as global uncertainties persist, particularly following the escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran. After plunging by nearly 5% amid the rising geopolitical strain, Bitcoin managed to recover, bouncing back above $105,000 and currently trading around $106,800. The past 24 hours have been highlighted by Bitcoin recovering toward $108,000 briefly again, but with escalating tensions in the Middle East, there&#8217;s a good chance it could crash soon. This aligns with an outlook from a crypto analyst, who noted that Bitcoin might crash toward $100,000. Resistance Band Faces Test For Bitcoin According to crypto analyst Pejman_Zwin on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is hovering within a confluence of resistance and short liquidation zones, stretching from $105,330 to $107,120. This range, he notes, is not only a structural resistance zone but also corresponds with the cumulative short liquidation leverage area. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions Basically, this means there&#8217;s a high possibility of an intensified price volatility if this zone is challenged or broken. The charts also reveal the presence of a possible contracting triangle pattern, which is a bearish continuation setup in the context of a larger correction. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $106,600 convincingly, the structure could shift from a corrective triangle to a five-wave downward impulse. This would cause a deeper retracement, especially as the price is already forming lower highs within the triangle. As such, the longer Bitcoin lingers in this resistance range without a breakout, the higher the likelihood of a rapid downward move. Bearish And Bull Targets If Bitcoin were to confirm this breakdown, the analyst noted the first major target around the lower boundary of the support zone, which lies between $105,330 and $103,162. This zone is reinforced by the monthly pivot point and also overlaps with the cumulative long liquidation leverage region. The 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart further highlighted a potential short setup from the reversal zone near $107,100 and a projected target close to $104,300. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Further downside could pull the price toward the next support band around $102,600 or even down to $101,000, should liquidation pressure persist. Pejman, on the other hand, pointed out that a sustained breakout above the $107,120 resistance line could initiate a bullish reversal and push Bitcoin back towards the heavy resistance cluster above $108,000. A strong daily close above $108,000 could cancel the bearish outlook. However, failure to break above here could lead to a rejection and another downside move. Although Bitcoin is starting to show some signs of bullishness, its price action is still vulnerable to a quick pullback, especially if the tensions in the Middle East continue to unfold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,638, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. This subdued price action shows its current consolidation nature.
