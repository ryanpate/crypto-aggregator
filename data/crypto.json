      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-consolidation-continues-2-key-support-levels-to-watch/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) prices showed a sideways movement in the past day producing no significant changes. Following the recent rejection at the $110,000 price range, the maiden cryptocurrency failed to break out of a descending consolidatory channel; therefore, fears on the current status of the bull market remain intact. Amidst the current mood of uncertainty, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez has identified two important support levels in the advent of a price downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To \u2018Very Bullish\u2019 \u2014 What This Means On-Chain Data Reveals Strong Bitcoin Support At $106,500 And $98,500 In an X post on July 5, Ali Martinez shares a potentially impactful on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market. Using data from the In/Out Money Around Price (IOMAP) Chart from Sentora, the analyst shares that major support zones have emerged that could play a crucial role in shaping the BTC&#8217;s short-term price direction. The IOMAP chart analyzes Bitcoin wallet addresses and the average prices at which they acquired BTC, giving insights into potential zones of buying or selling pressure. Essentially, it shows where holders are currently in profit i.e. in the money&#8221; or at a loss i.e. out of the money. From the chart, it is observed that 1.68 million addresses bought 1.28 million BTC between $104,982 and $108,190, with an average acquisition price of $106,738. Historically, such large concentrations of buying activity tend to form strong support zones, as holders may defend their positions from slipping into loss. Therefore, this development makes the $106,700 range a formidable near-term support level. A second significant support level is identified in the $95,247 to $98,566 range, where 1.7 million addresses acquired 1.25 million BTC at an average price of $96,901. Should Bitcoin lose its footing above $106,000, this lower range would act as the next major cushion, potentially absorbing downward momentum. However, a decisive price close below $96,901 would confirm significant bearish intent by the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds \u2013 Details Bitcoin Market Overview According to data from the IOMAP chart, around 89.36% of all BTC addresses are \u201cin the money,\u201d meaning their holdings were purchased at a lower price than the current market value. This is generally considered a bullish signal, suggesting the majority of market participants are in profit and thus less pressured to sell. Meanwhile, only 10.36% of addresses are \u201cout of the money,\u201d highlighting the relatively low risk of widespread panic selling, unless Bitcoin were to break below these critical levels highlighted above. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade at $108,154 reflecting a 0.24% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, it&#8217;s daily trading volume is down by 27.09% and valued at $31.04 billion. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-set-a-higher-low-bulls-target-2024-high-to-trigger-altseason/",
      "summary": "Altcoins have spent the past few years under the shadow of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, struggling to reclaim relevance as capital and attention largely concentrated on BTC. But the tide may be turning. Since April, the Total 2 \u2014 a metric representing the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin \u2014 has climbed 35%, signaling a potential shift in momentum toward altcoins. This recovery marks one of the strongest altcoin performances in recent years and has reignited hopes of a broader market expansion beyond Bitcoin. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Daan has weighed in on this development, highlighting a key technical formation: a higher low on the Total 2 chart during the recent market bounce. This structure is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that investors are stepping in to accumulate altcoins at increasingly higher price levels. If confirmed with a higher high in the coming days or weeks, this could mark the start of a sustainable altseason. As macroeconomic conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns, altcoins could see renewed interest from traders and investors. The next key test will be whether bulls can reclaim higher levels and flip the broader altcoin market structure definitively back to bullish. Altcoins Prepare For A Breakout Altcoins remain about 50% below their all-time highs, but bulls are setting the stage for what could be an expansive move in the coming weeks. After months of underperformance, the broader altcoin market is beginning to show early signs of structural recovery. Ethereum \u2014 the market\u2019s leader among altcoins \u2014 has been consolidating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May, and many analysts believe that a breakout in ETH could serve as the catalyst for a broader altcoin rally. Daan recently highlighted a key technical development: the Total 2 Altcoin Market Cap has made a higher low during the latest bounce, a structure that often precedes bullish continuation. This higher low suggests growing demand and reduced downside pressure, both of which are critical to establishing a sustainable uptrend. The key area to watch is the 2024 high setback in May. If bulls can push Total 2 above that level, it would confirm a higher high \u2014 the final piece needed to flip the high timeframe structure decisively back to bullish. That breakout would likely usher in renewed momentum across mid- and small-cap tokens, fueling what many hope will be the long-awaited altseason. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern, but signs of accumulation are growing stronger. If Ethereum can break out of its multi-month range, the altcoin market could rapidly reprice, erasing months of losses and opening the door to a new wave of capital rotation out of Bitcoin dominance. As long as key levels hold and risk appetite improves, the foundation is in place for altcoins to make a significant move higher.

After a prolonged downtrend that began in late 2022, Ethereum has stabilized near the 0.023 BTC level, forming a potential bottom. While the pair remains well below the 50-week, 100-week, and 200-week moving averages\u2014indicating continued bearish pressure\u2014momentum appears to be shifting. Since bottoming out in mid-June, ETH/BTC has held its ground and is attempting to build a base, with early signs of accumulation. However, without a clear breakout above resistance zones, particularly around the 0.025\u20130.027 BTC range, bulls will struggle to confirm a trend reversal. A decisive move above these levels would be the first major confirmation of strength for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern \u2013 $2,200 Support Back In Focus? This breakout is essential for altseason.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/doge-bulls-hold-the-line-at-0-15-is-the-rally-still-alive/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin (DOGE) prices have crashed by over 4% in the past month indicating a slightly dominant bearish influence in recent weeks. Similar to the crypto market leader (Bitcoin), the prominent altcoin and memecoin has registered significant market corrections since attaining a local peak of $0.249 on May 22. However, recent revelations by top analyst Ali Martinez has shown a bullish market condition that supports a price rebound for the DOGE market. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins DOGE Bulls Eye Return To $0.22 In an X post on July 5, Martinez provides some technical insights into the DOGE market highlighting an important requisite for the altcoin to rediscover its bullish form. Using the daily trading DOGEUSDT chart, the renowned analyst identifies an ascending trendline that stretches to 2023. At multiple instances of a retest, this trendline has acted as an efficient support consistently rejecting a further price decline. According to Martinez&#8217;s analysis, Dogecoin is trading around this trendline which presently runs through the $0.150 price level. The analyst explains market bulls must defend this price zone which not only fuels the chances of a price rebound, but essentially prevents a breakdown and complete transition to a bearish market. Interestingly, all retest of the highlighted trendline has always produced a price bounce resulting in a parabolic rally. This event is seen in price surges of $0.059 to $0.210 (\u2248255% gain) between 2023-2024, and $0.095 to $0.470 (\u2248395%) in 2024. However, Ali Martinez presents a conservative price target, stating a defence of $0.15 support level supports a quick bullish return to at least $0.220. Nevertheless, in the presence of a strong bullish pressure as seen in previous rallies, DOGE investors may expect a further rise to around $0.24 with a potential to return to the local market peak of $0.47. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin \u2013 Will $96 Resistance Crack? DOGE Price Overview At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.164 reflecting a modest price gain of 0.91% and 0.56% on the daily chart and weekly chart, respectively. Meanwhile, the memecoin has recorded a 56.81% crash in its daily trading volume indicating a significant fall in market interest. According to data from price prediction site Coincodex, general sentiment in the DOGE market is bearish. However, investors retain an healthy market demand as evidenced by a Fear &#38; Greed Index of 67 i.e. significant amount of greed. For the short-term, Coincodex analysts expects DOGE to still maintain a price around $0.160 in the next five days while projecting a price gain to $0.193 in a month. Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts show little expected price growth in the far future as indicated by price targets of $0.197 in three months, and $0.169 in six months.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-wyckoff-accumulation-hints-at-explosive-q3-4k-level-in-sight/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading just above the $2,500 mark following days of volatility, choppy price action, and uncertainty across crypto markets. Despite the hesitation, bulls have held critical support, and the coming days are shaping up to be a defining moment for Ethereum and the broader altcoin space. Momentum is slowly shifting as investors look for confirmation that ETH will lead the next wave of upside action. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Ted Pillows has shared a bullish technical outlook, suggesting that a Wyckoff accumulation pattern is currently unfolding. According to Pillows, this structure resembles the early stages of major breakouts seen in past cycles and signals strong smart money positioning. He argues that Ethereum already played a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s latest rally to new all-time highs, and now it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s turn to shine. A sustained breakout above the $2,600\u2013$2,700 range could trigger the next phase of the cycle, with $3,000 in sight as the initial target. With market sentiment recovering and BTC consolidating near highs, traders and investors are closely watching Ethereum\u2019s next move to gauge whether an altseason is around the corner. The setup is in place \u2014 but ETH must deliver. Ethereum Builds Strength Ethereum is up 82% from its April lows, demonstrating strong bullish control as the price holds firmly above key demand zones. Despite recent volatility, ETH continues to trade within a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700, a structure that has persisted since early May. This tight consolidation suggests the market is preparing for a decisive breakout, one that could define Ethereum\u2019s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Ted Pillows reveals that Ethereum is now undergoing a classic Wyckoff accumulation pattern. According to his analysis, this phase marks the transfer of ETH from weak hands to strong hands, and it mirrors past cycle setups that led to explosive rallies. Pillows argues that Ethereum helped push Bitcoin to new all-time highs, and now it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s turn to take the spotlight. If this pattern plays out, Pillows sees a clear path: first a breakout to $3,000, followed by a healthy correction, and then a push to $4,000 sometime in Q3. Beyond that, the real parabolic move may begin, driven by renewed confidence, broader altcoin participation, and sustained demand for ETH as a core asset in the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support \u2013 Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH Holds Above Key Support Amid Tight Range Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,520, maintaining its position above critical support levels despite recent volatility. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has acknowledged the $2,480\u2013$2,500 zone multiple times since late May, signaling strong buyer interest at these levels. The price remains trapped within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, with no clear breakout yet in either direction. ETH is currently trading near its 50- and 100-period SMAs, which are converging around the current price, indicating equilibrium and a potential inflection point. The 200-period SMA sits below $2,200 and continues to trend upward, supporting the longer-term bullish structure. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support \u2013 Bulls Eye $20 Range Volume has remained relatively stable, with no spike suggesting institutional accumulation or mass distribution. For bulls to regain full momentum, ETH must reclaim the $2,600\u2013$2,700 resistance and flip it into support. On the downside, a clean break below $2,480 could expose the $2,300 zone once again.
