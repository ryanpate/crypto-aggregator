      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-staking-hits-record-high-29-02-of-supply-locked-signals-long-term-conviction/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading at a critical level after reclaiming the $2,400 mark, showing resilience in the face of market-wide volatility. Bulls have managed to defend key support levels following a recent fakeout below $2,200, but momentum remains fragile as ETH struggles to establish a clear trend. Despite attempts to push higher, price action is consolidating near the mid-range, suggesting indecision among traders. However, fundamental strength continues to build beneath the surface. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears \u2013 Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout Top analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a major on-chain development: the percentage of Ethereum supply being staked has reached a new all-time high. This milestone signals rising confidence among long-term holders and validators, who are increasingly locking up ETH to secure the network and earn yield. Elevated staking levels historically coincide with lower active supply and reduced sell pressure\u2014an encouraging sign for bulls anticipating a breakout. As macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical risks persist, Ethereum\u2019s price behavior at this level could determine whether the broader altcoin market finally ignites. For now, ETH sits at a technical and psychological crossroads, with both bulls and bears preparing for the next major move. All eyes are on staking data and price structure to guide what comes next. Ethereum Builds Bullish Momentum As Staking Hits All-Time High Ethereum has climbed 75% from its April lows, showing strong recovery and resilience in a volatile market. Despite this impressive rebound, ETH remains nearly 98% below its all-time high, leaving significant upside potential. Many analysts believe Ethereum could be gearing up for a rally that may trigger the long-awaited altseason. However, caution still lingers in the market due to ongoing global risks and macroeconomic uncertainty, including rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions. The growing optimism is supported by improving on-chain fundamentals. Ted Pillows highlighted a key metric showing that the percentage of Ethereum supply staked has reached a new all-time high of 29.02%. This steady increase in staked ETH reflects strong long-term conviction from holders, who are choosing to lock up their assets to support the network and earn yield rather than sell during market turbulence. Historically, high levels of staking reduce active circulating supply, which can ease sell pressure and fuel bullish price movements. Combined with technical strength and growing confidence among long-term investors, Ethereum appears well-positioned for a breakout, provided bulls can hold current levels and reclaim resistance zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level \u2013 Bullish Continuation In Focus ETH Reclaims Key Level But Faces Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after bouncing from its April 2025 lows and reclaiming the $2,400 level. On the weekly chart, ETH is up over 10% this week, closing firmly above the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) at $2,437.52 \u2014 a key threshold that previously acted as both resistance and support in past cycles. Reclaiming this level is a bullish sign and shows that buyers are stepping back in after months of selling pressure. However, Ethereum now faces significant resistance around the $2,625\u20132,660 zone, where the 100-week and 50-week SMAs converge. This zone has historically served as a pivot for major price action, and a clear break above it would likely trigger a broader rally targeting the $2,800\u2013$3,000 range. Volume has also picked up, signaling renewed interest, though it remains below early 2024 levels. This indicates cautious optimism among traders, especially as global macro uncertainty and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on markets. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "title": "Bitcoin Dominance Holds Altcoin Season At Bay, Analyst Says No Upside Until This Happens",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-dominance-holds-altseason/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) continues to exert pressure on the broader crypto market, casting a shadow on the prospects of an incoming altcoin season. Despite recent volatility and decline in the market, a crypto analyst observes that Bitcoin Dominance remains firmly elevated, signaling that capital is still concentrated in the leading cryptocurrency. This trend, they argue, is preventing any meaningful breakout for altcoins and could persist unless a decisive shift in market structure occurs. Altcoin Season Stifled As Bitcoin Dominance Surges The Bitcoin Dominance in the cryptocurrency market is tightening its grip, crushing hopes of an imminent altcoin season. According to a recent technical analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter) by market expert Tony Severino, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance has reached 65.72% with both monthly and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings pushing above the critical 70 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Above 66% \u2013 How This 4-Year ATH Affects Altcoin Season At the time of the analysis, the RSI on the monthly timeline stood at 73.19, while the weekly registered at 70.58\u2014both firmly in overbought territory. These levels typically reflect strong momentum and extended bullish conditions, indicating that Bitcoin\u2019s command over the crypto market is still strong and growing. Severino shared a dual chart view of Bitcoin Dominance and RSI across the weekly and monthly time frames, highlighting candlestick structures that support Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing upward momentum. BTC.D has been climbing since late 2023. The RSI values also remain comfortably above their respective Moving Average (MA) baselines of 67.31 and 65.42, indicating sustained strength rather than signs of immediate exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin Dominance holds these elevated RSI levels across their major time frames, Severino suggests that altcoins will likely continue to underperform, further delaying the long-awaited altcoin season. The analyst emphasizes that meaningful upside for altcoins will not begin until BTC.D starts to wane and RSI readings fall below 70\u2014effectively signaling a shift in sentiment and market strength that could allow capital to rotate to alternative cryptocurrencies. Until such a pullback occurs, the analyst argues that the weekly and monthly BTC.D and RSI charts strongly indicate that any expectations of an altcoin season this cycle remain premature. Dragonfly Doji Forms On BTC.D Chart In another X post, Severino announced that the Bitcoin Dominance has potentially formed a Dragonfly Doji on the weekly chart. With four days left in the weekly session, the analyst notes that the distinct candle pattern is still developing but presently resembles the classic Dragonfly Doji, characterized by a long lower wick and a close near the opening price. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here\u2019s Why Typically, this chart pattern is viewed as a bullish reversal signal when it appears at the bottom of a downtrend, indicating possible upside momentum. However, in this case, it has emerged during a broader uptrend in BTC.D, creating a more complicated technical picture. Severino believes that the Dragonfly Doji could either represent a continuation of the current momentum or a temporary pause in market direction. If the candle evolves into a larger bullish body and closes above the 65.65% level, it may confirm further strengthening of Bitcoin\u2019s growing market dominance relative to altcoins.

      "summary": "Bitcoin held steady Friday as traders braced for a potential shake-up at the Federal Reserve. United States President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a move that could shift the central bank\u2019s approach to interest rates and market liquidity. The Dow Jones climbed more than 300 points midweek, and the ripple reached the crypto market too\u2014Bitcoin nudged higher to around 106,950 before easing slightly. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin\u2019s $107K Push Markets are reading this as a signal. If Powell is pushed out in favor of someone more open to cutting rates, risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could benefit. The US dollar slipped to a three-year low, and bond yields retreated, adding to the sense that easier money may be coming. For crypto investors, this is a setup worth watching. The #USD fell to a three-year low on intensifying speculation that President Trump could soon nominate a new Fed Chair to replace Powell after his term ends next May, a development that could render him a lame duck writes @johnjhardy in today&#8217;s #forex update.\u2026 \u2014 Ole S Hansen (@Ole_S_Hansen) June 26, 2025 Trump Moves Toward Possible Fed Overhaul Reports from multiple outlets say Trump is seriously considering replacing Powell before his term ends in 2026. Though no official announcement has been made, sources suggest Trump has discussed potential successors with advisors. His criticism of Powell\u2019s policies isn\u2019t new, but the recent rise in inflation concerns and election-year pressure may be accelerating the timeline. The market response was immediate. Traders began to price in a more dovish Fed policy, which generally means lower interest rates and increased liquidity. That would be good news for crypto, which has languished under tighter monetary conditions throughout the last year. Bitcoin, which is often used as a hedge against fiat debasement, likes to rally when the dollar declines and rates come down. Bitcoin Price Reacts With Caution Bitcoin was trading at 106,950 Friday, with a daily high of 107,250 and a low of 106,145. It wasn\u2019t a breakout, but it was a clear sign of rising interest. Ethereum and other top coins saw similar quiet moves upward. Traders are treading carefully, knowing that talk of replacing the Fed chair is one thing, but actually doing it is another. Stocks Lead The Way, Crypto Follows The bullish mood started with equities. The Dow surged more than 300 points, while the S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq also closed higher. Tech stocks led the rally, pushed by falling Treasury yields and hopes that rate hikes are off the table for now. That optimism spilled into crypto markets, where risk sentiment plays a big role. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears Crypto Market Eyes Washington There\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty. Powell is in office, and no formal replacement has been named. But the fact that President Trump is entertaining the idea is already moving markets. Crypto investors are especially sensitive to changes in the macro outlook, and this could be a key one. Featured image from Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Bitwise Asset Management has quietly nudged Dogecoin one step closer to Wall Street\u2019s ETF club, filing an amended S-1 on 26 June that for the first time allows \u201cin-kind\u201d creations and redemptions. The tweak is more than procedural. It lines the proposed Bitwise Dogecoin ETF up with the operational playbook the US Securities and Exchange Commission already blessed for spot-bitcoin and spot-ether products, and it signals that SEC staff are now deep in the weeds on the mechanics of custody and settlement. Signs Point To Dogecoin ETF Approval \u201cBitwise has filed amended S-1s for their spot Dogecoin ETF and their spot Aptos ETFs. Good signs as it indicates SEC engagement, and tracks with other spot approvals,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X. He underscored the importance of the new language: \u201cOne HUGE update to the filing is \u2018in-kind\u2019 creations and redemptions\u2026 Near-lock at this point that in-kind will be allowed in spot ETFs across board.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal\u2014But One Move Could Ruin It The change matters because in-kind processing lets authorized participants swap DOGE directly for ETF shares (and vice versa) without the tax friction and slippage that accompany the cash-only model imposed on futures-based crypto funds. The SEC\u2019s willingness to consider that structure for a dog-branded altcoin would have seemed fanciful a year ago. It now appears consistent with the regulator\u2019s post-bitcoin-ETF d\u00e9tente, during which issuers also sought in-kind redemptions. Approval odds are converging on the high end of the spectrum. Less than a week ago, Balchunas and fellow analyst James Seyffart raised their probability for \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of pending altcoin ETFs\u2014including Dogecoin\u2014to \u201c90 percent or higher,\u201d citing what Seyffart called \u201cvery positive\u201d SEC engagement.

      "summary": "Bitcoin traders everywhere will be watching their feeds closely, willing the world\u2019s largest crypto to hold steady at or near its current $107K mark. $15B in Bitcoin options expire today, a major portion of the roughly $40B in options outstanding. If $BTC\u2019s price falls to $102K or below, the market would endure a true \u2018pain point.\u2019 As long as that doesn\u2019t happen, Bitcoin looks set to press on with business as normal \u2013 setting the stage for further growth of the ecosystem and the first meme coin offering direct $BTC exposure, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Narrowing Volatility Indicates Positive Outlook The $BTC volatility index has narrowed in recent days, drawing more closely to the historical volatility and generally indicating that traders don\u2019t expect dramatic price moves either way \u2013 up or down. That was supported by Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David P\u00e9quignot, who stated: \u2018Low open interest in perps and fairly depressed Bitcoin implied volatility and skew are indicative of limited expectations for sharp price movements\u2026\u2019 Where does that leave Bitcoin?

Metaplanet just added 1,234 $BTC, bringing its total portfolio north of 12K $BTC. And it isn\u2019t just direct Bitcoin purchases; the ecosystem around the world\u2019s leading crypto continues to fuel demand. ETFs Notch 13 Days Consecutive Inflows, Bitcoin Overtakes Google Bitcoin ETFs are building on a 13-day stretch of positive inflows. Monday to Thursday, daily cumulative inflows amounted to: $350M $588M $547M $226M Positive inflows point to long-term interest from retail and institutional investors, rather than short-term traders, and contribute to underlying buying pressure. And with the largest Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, holding over $70B in total assets, Bitcoin took advantage of weakening Alphabet stock to overthrow Google as the world\u2019s sixth-largest asset. It\u2019s a combination of fundamentally positive factors, reinforcing a bullish case for $BTC \u2013 and the meme coin built on that case. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Meme Coin Trusting $BTC to Hit $250K and Beyond BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is confident that Bitcoin will one day reach $250K and more \u2013 so confident that the project is built around key Bitcoin price milestones.

Bitcoin $225K: A final $BTCBULL burn. Bitcoin $250K: A massive $BTCBULL airdrop. The combination of token burns and airdrops encourages positive momentum for BTC Bull Token, following Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory. The presale has raised $7.5M so far. Only three days remain in the presale, so act now \u2013 you can learn how to buy BTC Bull token in our guide. Tokens currently cost $0.00258, but our analysts expect the price to hit $0.0084 by year-end. Visit the BTC Bull token website today. BTC Options Expire, But Outlook Is Bullish for Bitcoin With $15B in Bitcoin options expiring, narrowing volatility, and consistent ETF inflows, Bitcoin\u2019s foundation looks stronger than ever. For investors looking to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, BTC Bull Token offers a bold, milestone-based roadmap aligned with $BTC\u2019s rise to $250K. But be warned \u2013 there\u2019s mere days left in the presale, so the window to join is closing fast. Always do your own research. This is not financial advice."
