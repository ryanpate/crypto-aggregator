      "summary": "In a post on June 17, prominent crypto strategist Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) outlined his high-conviction roadmap for Bitcoin\u2019s next major breakout, emphasizing that timing\u2014not just price\u2014is the most critical factor for those still on the sidelines. Despite projecting a continuation of the broader uptrend that began at $18,000 in 2023, Astronomer warned that jumping in prematurely could blunt the risk-reward ratio of the next leg. \u201cPlanning to buy now into BTC is expected to net you a move of over 70% in a short period of time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the closer BTC is to breaking out.\u201d Buy Bitcoin Now? His primary thesis: Bitcoin\u2019s breakout will not occur before June 30, and any significant move is statistically more likely after that date. This aligns with what he calls one of the \u201cmost ancient crypto mechanics\u201d\u2014Bitcoin moves first, and altcoins follow. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Astronomer\u2019s roadmap presents a tiered accumulation strategy rooted in probabilistic support zones. \u201cUpon statistical analysis, the expected close before going up only is around $103k,\u201d he wrote. \u201cProbably a good level to start getting involved. [\u2026] The expected level to be reached based on all prior signals (lowest wick) is $96k. Probably a good level to buy heavy if given. [\u2026] And finally, the expected lowest close is $90k. Probably a good level to allocate (almost) all your dry powder.\u201d But beyond the price levels, Astronomer places stronger emphasis on timing: \u201cIf the price doesn&#8217;t go as deep into the $90\u2019s\u2014which I don&#8217;t think is very likely\u2014I expect June to close between $95-110k and not go much lower. Then I&#8217;d buy more and more the closer we get to those 10 weeks regardless of the price. Time is more important than price.\u201d He also pointed to structural market dynamics supporting his thesis, including a bullish spot-to-perpetual rotation: \u201cThe order books start to rotate towards green into spot, red into perps (aggressive shorts, aggressive spot buys), simply visible with the increasing spot premiums.\u201d Adding to the signal strength is a recent weekly hash ribbon print\u2014\u201cone that never failed,\u201d he noted. Related Reading: $150,000 Bitcoin Is In Play\u2014Unless This One Macro Metric Snaps Astronomer further offered guidance for navigating altcoins, advising traders to wait for the breakout rather than attempting to catch falling knives. \u201cBuying alts when BTC breaks out [\u2026] is smarter than trying to knife catch them. To eliminate the drawdown and reap the upside rewards.\u201d Summarizing his plan, he said, \u201cIf I was sidelined, I&#8217;d look to buy below $103k and as much as possible as close to $90k as possible. And the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the more confident I become.\u201d Astronomer\u2019s final message underscores that his bullish stance hasn\u2019t changed since the flip at $18K: \u201cNo top being in yet, until we reach at least 170k+. That is the plan.\u201d And for those still unsure? He offers a blunt reminder: \u201c"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-could-rise-3x-to-300000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has continued to hover above the $100,000 mark over the past few days, and its price action has stabilized around $105,000 in the wake of recent market tensions and despite inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. A new analysis shared by crypto market commentator Gert van Lagen suggests that this current phase is going to precede an explosive move similar to those seen in previous market cycles. Backing his prediction with historical data and Glassnode\u2019s AVIV Ratio chart, the analyst noted that the current on-chain structure echoes moments before Bitcoin\u2019s major rallies in past bull markets. AVIV Ratio Flashes Familiar Pattern Before Market Top Bitcoin&#8217;s price volatility has slightly cooled since the initial surge to a new all-time high above $111,800 in May, and the latest candlestick structure suggests it may be preparing for another leg higher. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? Taking to the social media platform X, Gert van Lagen revealed a Bitcoin price prediction that centers around the true market Deviation metric known as the AVIV Ratio. This orange-colored line on the chart tracks a specific deviation in Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior and has always crossed a red line denoting +3 standard deviations at or just before cycle tops. The current AVIV behavior can be compared to previous price points before market tops in previous cycles. For instance, in 2013, the AVIV Ratio flagged a major rally when Bitcoin was trading near $200, shortly before the price pushed past $1,200. In 2017, the metric behaved similarly when Bitcoin was trading at $3,700 and later peaked near $20,000. The current AVIV Ratio can also be compared to when Bitcoin was priced at $13,000 in the 2021 bull market run, before its surge to an all-time high of $69,000. According to the analyst, today\u2019s AVIV ratio level is closely aligned with those previous mid-cycle breakouts. The current ratio has not yet crossed the red +3\u03c3 line, which the analyst refers to as the cycle top trigger. As such, its current reading suggests Bitcoin may be in the early phase of a major bull market expansion. If history repeats itself, a 3x move from today\u2019s levels would be a standard price move in line with previous price action. $300,000 Target Within Sight If AVIV Behavior Holds Crypto analyst van Lagen stops short of calling for an immediate top, but his analysis implies that Bitcoin could be preparing for a new parabolic surge to the upside. Using the AVIV model as a reference, a conservative 3x multiplier on the current Bitcoin price places a possible target around $300,000. Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,997, having decreased by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to impact cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin (BTC) recently dipping below the $105,000 mark, market analyst VirtualBacon has shared insights suggesting that altcoins are gearing up for a potentially robust summer. Emerging AI Memecoins In a recent update on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), he highlighted several promising developments within the altcoin space. VirtualBacon pointed to an emerging wave of AI-focused Layer-1 blockchain projects, many backed by prominent figures in both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. He mentioned several names to watch, including Sahara Labs, Sentient AGI, and Gaianet, among others. While these projects have yet to release tokens, many are expected to conduct airdrops or early access rounds, presenting opportunities for early investors. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge For those seeking \u201chigher-risk, high-reward investments,\u201d VirtualBacon noted the impressive performance of artificial intelligence (AI) agent memecoins. He cited the launch of IRIS, which skyrocketed from a $220,000 fully diluted valuation (FDV) to $120 million, representing a 600x return. Platforms such as Virtuals, CreatorBid, and SeedifyFund are turning user engagement into allocation opportunities, likening this phenomenon to a form of airdrop farming on steroids. In addition, VirtualBacon highlighted a relatively overlooked area: Bittensor subnet tokens. He mentioned that seasoned investors can now acquire early-stage subnets directly on Bittensor\u2019s chain, with projects like SN65_TPN and inference_labs raising capital through token auctions at valuations below $4 million. Stablecoins Take Center Stage Turning to real-world assets (RWAs), VirtualBacon advised focusing on mid-cap infrastructure projects with tangible revenue streams. He pointed to CHEX and CPOOL, which has shown consistent upward movement, as examples of promising investments. Another emerging narrative is the merger and acquisition activity involving public companies and crypto projects. VirtualBacon noted that Tron is set to go public through a Nasdaq reverse merger, while Mixie has been acquired by Netcapital, which boasts a team that includes notable figures like Tim Draper and a co-founder of Helium. A particularly intriguing development is World Liberty Financial (WLF), co-founded by Eric and Donald Jr. Trump, which aims to become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With plans for its own stablecoin, USD1, and expected to launch in October, the token could have an estimated FDV of $10\u201315 billion, a conservative projection given its potential. VirtualBacon also pointed out that stablecoins are becoming central to macroeconomic strategies. Tether now ranks as the fifth-largest holder of US Treasuries, highlighting the increasing need for buyers in the market. The analyst urged investors to keep an eye on stablecoin projects that integrate artificial intelligence technology and yield generation, such as USD1, Circle\u2019s USDC, and others. Liquidity Shifts To Altcoin Platforms In the gaming sector, liquidity is coalescing around BlackholeDex, a decentralized exchange (DEX) backed by the AVAX Foundation. With a fee-sharing model similar to Aerodrome and Shadow, BlackholeDex has launched veNFT staking, aligning long-term incentives for users. Related Reading: Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come Lastly, in the Solana ecosystem, Saros DLMM is emerging as a strong competitor to existing platforms like Jupiter and Meteora, utilizing similar bucket-based liquidity pools but with lower fees. It also plans a RADY meme airdrop for SAROS stakers, which could attract early adopters and fuel rapid growth, thus closing the list of highlighted altcoins. As of this writing, Ethereum, the market\u2019s leading altcoin, is trading at $2,521. It has consolidated above this level after dropping sharply from its two-week high of $2,878.

Based on reports, this advice aims to boost returns without exposing investors to outsized risk. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Early Adoption Timeline BBVA began executing crypto trades in 2021 for a handful of clients. By September 2024, Meyer says the bank had started formally recommending a 3% Bitcoin stake in balanced portfolios. Now, risk\u2011tolerant clients can move up to 7% into digital assets, reflecting BBVA\u2019s growing confidence in crypto as a mainstream option. Philippe Meyer recently delivered a presentation at a blockchain conference in Lugano, Switzerland. Source: BBVA Switzerland. Client Reaction And Risk Views Many clients have responded well so far.

Short\u2011term swings still occur\u2014crypto markets can drop 20% in a week\u2014but private clients seem ready to ride those waves in pursuit of higher gains. According to Reuters, BBVA, Spain\u2019s second-largest bank, has been advising its private banking clients since September 2024 to allocate 3% to 7% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies based on their risk appetite.

For now, only high\u2011net\u2011worth clients hear this crypto advice. But if allocations deliver solid returns and BBVA weathers any market crashes, other banks may follow. That would give more investors the chance to include crypto alongside stocks, bonds, and real estate. The real test will come if Bitcoin or Ether plunge sharply. If BBVA\u2019s cautious plan holds up under stress, it may reshape how mainstream finance treats digital assets. Featured image from ESG News, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/jpmorgan-launches-usd-deposit-token-not-stablecoin/",
      "summary": "After days of rumors around the identity of the mysterious \u2018JPMD\u2019 token filed by JPMorgan, widely supposed to be a stablecoin, the truth has finally emerged. JPMD isn\u2019t a stablecoin after all \u2013 it\u2019s a deposit token on the Base blockchain (Coinbase\u2019s own blockchain). With JPMD, institutions have a round-the-clock method of making deposits, incorporating established banking systems with blockchain technology. It\u2019s one more step along the path towards crypto as a normal part of everyday life, alongside core crypto projects like Best Wallet token. Time to learn more about why JPMorgan thinks deposit tokens are part of the future of crypto. Not a Surprise After All: JPMorgan Champions Deposit Tokens Perhaps everyone should have guessed what JPMD was. After all, one of the largest banks in the US is hardly likely to do anything without a lot of research and preparation. And in this case, JPMorgan has been championing blockchain-powered deposit tokens since at least 2022. That was when the company published an extensive report on the utility and function of proposed deposit tokens. Calling them \u2018a foundation for stable digital money,\u2019 JPMorgan outlined a number of core advantages a deposit token could offer to traditional banks: \u2714\ufe0f Digital form of commercial bank money \u2013 deposit token fills the role of existing deposit claims \u2714\ufe0f Blockchain-native programmability \u2013 with deposit tokens, banks can access smart contracts, an atomic settlement option, and automated processing \u2714\ufe0f Payment efficiency and cost reduction \u2013 on-chain deposit tokens provide real-time transfers; no more waiting for deposits to settle after-hours \u2714\ufe0f Seamless integration with banking \u2013 established use cases, existing support networks, and even clear legal status; there\u2019s little to prevent immediate use of deposit tokens within the current banking infrastructure That last point is critical. Even while stablecoins draw increased attention, deposit tokens like JPMD hold one clear advantage: they fit neatly into existing rules and regulations. Trademark Filed, JPMorgan Builds Base for Crypto-Finance Integration JPMorgan filed the trademark application on June 15, 2025. As it turns out, the deposit token will be built on the Base blockchain and will leverage that chain to provide round-the-clock crypto access for its clients (Coinbase is one). If JPMD takes off \u2013 and it should, since JPMorgan has a market cap of roughly $738B \u2013 it could be the next step in the growing conjunction between crypto and finance. Institutions have led crypto adoption in recent months, but there are growing signs that retail adoption won\u2019t be far behind. Success in a fully integrated crypto-financial world will rest partly on the power of your crypto wallet. Best Wallet app is a leading non-custodial crypto wallet, and now the Best Wallet Token launch takes the wallet to the next level. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 Upgrade Your Crypto Wallet to be Future-Proof Best Wallet Token ($BEST) takes the power of the Best Wallet app up a notch. $BEST token holders gain: \u2705 Exclusive crypto presale access \u2705 Reduced trading fees \u2705 Increased staking rewards \u2705 Governance rights and participation Best Wallet is the only crypto presale wallet, offering an Upcoming Tokens feature where you can research and invest in the best crypto presales. It\u2019s all part of a growing crypto ecosystem where Best Wallet, Best Wallet Token, and the upcoming Best Card work together to equip you to navigate a brave new crypto world. That gives $BEST unique utility, even among other crypto presales. Currently, tokens cost $0.025195, and early investors can stake them for a 104% variable APY. Our price prediction sees the token price potentially reaching $0.035215 by the end of the year, delivering 40% returns to anyone who buys in now. Learn how to buy Best Wallet token, and don\u2019t forget to visit the Best Wallet Token presale page today. JPMorgan, Best Wallet Show Path Forward for Crypto Together, the launch of both $BEST and $JPMD highlights the way forward for crypto.

This isn\u2019t financial advice."
