      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-ipo-100b-xrp-price/",
      "summary": "The possibilities of a Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO) have become higher as time goes on and the company moves toward a complete resolution of its SEC lawsuit. With expectations of the IPO rising, possible valuations have started to fly around as the company is one of the largest cryptocurrency companies. Most notably, pro-XRP lawyer and community member John Deaton has proposed that the Ripple IPO could lead to the company being valued at over $100 billion. Deaton Puts Ripple At $100 Billion The comment and valuation from lawyer John Deaton come after Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, successfully completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO). So far, the crypto firm has found a lot of success in the market, surging from an initial $5 billion valuation to over $63 billion in valuation post-IPO. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Deaton responded to a post on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting this feat, pointing out how Ripple could be even more successful in this regard. He explains that despite Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse saying that the company was in no rush to go public, the IPO should be timed correctly to have the right impact. Pointing to the current market environment, he points out that if Circle can grow to a $63 billion valuation, then it means that Ripple can soar even higher. Given XRP\u2019s standing in the market as the 4th-largest cryptocurrency, ahead of Circle\u2019s USDC, which sits at 7th place, Deaton believes that Ripple\u2019s valuation post-IPO can rise to $100 billion. \u201cIf Circle can hit a 62B-75B market cap then Ripple, with nearly 40B XRP, currently valued at $2 (ie $80B), could certainly hit a $100B market cap in this environment,\u201d Deaton wrote. As Bitcoinist reported, Ripple had issued a $700 million tender offer with shares priced at $175. This now puts the equity valuation of the company at $25 billion with 141 million outstanding shares as investors look favorably at the crypto firm. How High Could The XRP Price Go? Market experts have speculated that if the Ripple IPO does go through and the valuation soars, the XRP price will soar in tandem. Crypto investor Dennis Liu shared a video that suggested a successful IPO would be positive for the XRP price. He points out that a symbiotic relationship of the XRP coin related to the Ripple stock would be the dream of investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align Other market experts have debated that the XRP price would go double-digits to rise above $10 if this happens. In some cases, the XRP price has been pegged as high as $100 if Ripple does complete its IPO and begins trading as a publicly listed company. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "A fund based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced a significant investment of $100 million in the Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial, and its native token WLFI. The investment was confirmed in a joint statement by Aqua 1 and World Liberty Financial, highlighting the collaboration as a step towards developing a blockchain financial ecosystem and integrating stablecoins. World Liberty Financial Partners With Aqua 1 Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, &#8220;We\u2019re excited to work hand-in-hand with the team at Aqua 1.\u201d This investment positions Aqua 1 among the largest stakeholders in the Trump family&#8217;s cryptocurrency project. It is further strengthened by the backing of crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is the top investor in the company with a substantial $75 million stake. Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move \u2014 Chart Signals Are Clear This marks the second investment from a UAE-based firm in World Liberty Financial within a short span; earlier this year, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s MGX used World Liberty Financial&#8217;s USD1 stablecoin to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance. David Lee, a founding partner at Aqua 1, stated that Aqua 1 and the decentralized platform will collaborate to \u201cidentify and nurture promising blockchain projects.\u201d World Liberty Financial also plans to support the Aqua Fund, an investment vehicle focused on enhancing the digital economy in the Middle East. In addition, Aqua 1 will aid World Liberty Financial in expanding its reach into South America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. Both companies are also set to develop &#8220;BlockRock,&#8221; a platform aimed at tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) to bridge traditional investments like real estate with the Web3 ecosystem. New App Launch Planned In tandem with these initiatives, World Liberty Financial is preparing to release an audit report of its stablecoin, USD1, within days. Folkman, speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, New York, also mentioned that the platform&#8217;s WLFI token may soon become tradable. Launched two months prior to the US presidential election, WLFI has already generated substantial revenue for Trump\u2019s family business through the sale of governance tokens. These tokens grant holders the ability to vote on project changes and influence its strategic direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In?

To further facilitate user engagement, Folkman announced the upcoming launch of a new app designed to simplify cryptocurrency use for everyday investors.

      "summary": "Data shows the Bitcoin Open Interest on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance has recently shot up. What could this mean for the asset&#8217;s price? Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Has Seen A Sharp Increase As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Open Interest on Binance has spiked. The &#8220;Open Interest&#8221; refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC positions that are currently open on a given derivatives platform. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. As the total amount of leverage present in the sector rises when new positions appear, this kind of trend can lead to the asset&#8217;s price becoming more volatile. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Since leverage goes down with such a trend, the cryptocurrency can become more stable following it. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-hour percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest for the Binance exchange over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the 24-hour change in the Binance Bitcoin Open Interest recently shot up to a notably positive value, implying the number of positions on the platform saw a significant jump. At the peak of this spike, the indicator hit a value of more than 6%. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that there have been a couple of other occasions that the metric has breached this mark during the past month. Interestingly, each of these spikes coincided with points that preceded a period of consolidation/decline for Bitcoin. As the quant notes, This recurring pattern suggests that large inflows into leveraged positions often precede periods where short-term gains are realized, leading to potential price pullbacks or sideways movement as market participants de-risk. The analyst has also shared another chart, this one tracking the 7-day change in the Realized Cap of the short-term holders and long-term holders. The &#8220;Realized Cap&#8221; refers to an indicator that keeps track of the capital that the holders have invested into Bitcoin. Below is a chart that shows the change in this metric for two investor cohorts, short-term holders (holding time of 155 days or lesser) and long-term holders (holding time greater than 155 days). As is apparent from the graph, the 7-day change in the Realized Cap has recently been positive for long-term holders, which suggests capital has been maturing from the short-term holders into this cohort. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals \u2018Opportunity\u2019 That said, earlier in the month, the indicator hit a peak of $57 billion, but today it has come down to just $3.5 billion. So, while capital is still aging into long-term holders, it&#8217;s now happening at a much slower rate. BTC Price Bitcoin has been attempting to break past the $108,000 mark, but so far, it hasn&#8217;t found success as its price is still trading around $107,200.

      "summary": "Cardano price started a fresh decline below the $0.5750 zone. ADA is now consolidating and might struggle to stay above the $0.550 support. ADA price started a fresh decline below $0.580 and $0.5750. The price is trading below $0.570 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.570 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it dips below the $0.550 support zone. Cardano Price Dips Again In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline below the $0.580, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA even declined below the $0.5750 level to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5102 swing low to the $0.5938 high. The price even spiked below the $0.5520 support. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.570 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading below $0.570 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.570 zone. The first resistance is near $0.5850. The next key resistance might be $0.5920. If there is a close above the $0.5920 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.620 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.6350 in the near term. Another Drop In ADA? If Cardano\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.5850 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.5520 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5102 swing low to the $0.5938 high. The next major support is near the $0.530 level. A downside break below the $0.530 level could open the doors for a test of $0.5120. The next major support is near the $0.50 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels \u2013 $0.5520 and $0.5300. Major Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.5850 and $0.6000."
