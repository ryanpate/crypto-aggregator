      "summary": "As geopolitical developments continue to impact global markets, the cryptocurrency space remains highly reactive.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-daily-candle-with-doji/",
      "summary": "The Dogecoin price is in focus, having closed the daily candle with a Doji. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade commented on this development and revealed what it could mean for the foremost meme coin. What\u2019s Next For Dogecoin Price Following Doji Daily Close In an X post, Trader Tardigrade highlighted the fact that the Dogecoin price daily candle closed with a Doji. He remarked that a new sign of a breakout has emerged following a Doji at the end of a downtrend. The analyst noted that this indicates a high possibility of a trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters Historical Bounce Zone, But Will This Time Be Different? The Dogecoin price has witnessed a massive decline over the last month, down over 27% during this period, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOGE has dropped way below the psychological $0.2 price level, providing a bearish outlook for the meme coin. However, Trader Tardigrade\u2019s analysis suggested that the meme coin could soon record another massive rally to the upside. The analyst\u2019s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reclaim the $0.2 level on this projected trend reversal to the upside. Fundamentals also support a DOGE rally, seeing as tensions in the Middle East have cooled off, with Israel and Iran agreeing to a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has again rallied and reclaimed the $106,000 level. This is bullish for the meme coin given its correlation with the flagship crypto. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, stating that DOGE season could be approaching soon. He revealed that the DOGE/BTC pair has experienced the last shakeout, signaling the start of the meme coin\u2019s season. His accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could rally above $2 once this DOGE season begins. Key Levels To Watch For DOGE In a YouTube video, crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the range between $0.12 and $0.142 as the key level to watch for the Dogecoin price. The analyst also alluded to DOGE\u2019s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), stating that the meme coin cannot afford to drop below 38. He claimed that a drop could lead to the meme coin falling into a bear market structure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.2: 4H Order Block Shows Exactly What\u2019s Happening Kevin Capital then highlighted the DOGE/BTC pair, noting that the meme coin is at a critical level that it needs to hold above if it is to outperform Bitcoin later in the year. The analyst expects the meme coin to make a significant run and outperform the flagship crypto when the Fed begins to ease monetary policies. The analyst remarked that a positive for DOGE is that there are bullish indicators flashing for the meme coin on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-as-polymarket-nears-1b-valuation-bitgo-hits-100b/",
      "summary": "In a sign of crypto\u2019s accelerating maturation, two major developments reinforce how institutional adoption and investor confidence are surging in tandem. BitGo, one of the largest crypto custodians, has seen its assets under custody balloon to $100B in 2025. Polymarket \u2013 a decentralized prediction market \u2013 is set to raise $200M at a $1B valuation, riding the wave of surging interest in crypto-native applications. The stories showcase how demand for both regulated, institutional-grade services and platforms is growing rapidly. Safety Plus Speculation BitGo\u2019s rise underscores the growing institutional hunger for secure, compliant infrastructure. The California-based firm now holds $100B in digital assets, a 66% increase from $60B at the start of the year. Much of that growth comes from increased demand for staking services (which now account for half of its holdings) and from a rising tide of institutional adoption. BitGo also expanded into South Korea in 2024 and Dubai in 2025, further building on an already powerful foundation in its aim to become more competitive in the industry. In contrast, Polymarket\u2019s trajectory highlights the viral growth of speculative, user-driven DeFi applications. The platform, known for letting users bet on everything from elections to sports outcomes, surged in popularity during the 2024 U.S. presidential cycle, processing over $3.3B in bets. Now, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund is reportedly leading a $200M funding round, positioning Polymarket to become a unicorn asset And this immediately after Polymarket announced a partnership with X. The timing is perfect: there&#8217;s a strong appetite for decentralized markets offering high-risk, high-reward plays. Confidence on Two Fronts These contrasting success stories reveal a broader truth: crypto is no longer a monolith. Institutional players are flocking to battle-tested custodians like BitGo, who offer the compliance and security infrastructure needed to satisfy regulators (so far, at least: BitGo remains banned in the US). Meanwhile, crypto-native projects like Polymarket are pulling a different kind of capital \u2013 Venture Capitals betting on engaging decentralized apps that leverage core blockchain values of trustless systems and open markets. Both Bitgo and Polymarket demonstrate the growing confidence in the crypto economy, and the potential lying in wait. Confidence from institutions, who now see crypto as a serious asset class, and from venture backers, who see new economic behaviors forming around blockchain-native markets. BitGo\u2019s next chapter could include a public listing by late 2025. And Polymarket is reportedly exploring a token launch \u2013 a move that could further incentivize users and decentralize governance. Interested in tapping into that same retail interest? Here are three of the best crypto to buy now. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Find and Snipe Best Solana Meme Coins Want to know a meme coin trading secret? Some of the best Solana meme coins never make it to major platforms. They trade \u2018underground,\u2019 on platforms like Telegram. Trading them isn\u2019t just about getting the right insider info; it\u2019s about finding them and executing razor-sharp, perfectly timed trades. That\u2019s precisely where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. It\u2019s the newest and best Solana meme crypto trading bot.

Visit the Best Wallet Token website. 3. Tron ($TRX) \u2013 Altcoin Chain with 125% Gains Over Past Year Even with a $25B market cap, Tron ($TRX) somehow often gets overlooked. That\u2019s a bit unfair to the ecosystem itself, but presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors. In fact, over the past year $TRX has posted 123% gains. Those gains are fueled not only by $TRX, but by broader activity on the Tron network, including $USDT. The world\u2019s leading stablecoin ($156B market cap) is heavily traded on Tron. The demand led to a recent minting of another $2B on the network. With stablecoins increasingly in the public eye \u2013 see the recent GENIUS Act \u2013 that demand is likely to only increase. BitGo and Polymarket Demonstrate Bullish Market Corporate success with BitGo and Polymarket shows just how broad the interest in crypto actually is \u2013 from retail investors to venture capitalists. And it makes these tokens some of the best crypto to buy right now. As always, do your own research \u2013 this isn\u2019t financial advice."

In a prepared statement, Powell stressed that \u201cinflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated,\u201d adding that the Federal Open Market Committee is \u201cwell-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\u201d Crypto\u2019s Fate May Be Sealed In July For crypto markets already oscillating on every nuance of policy guidance, the message was clear: the next four weeks\u2014anchored by the 12 July CPI release and the 19 July payrolls report\u2014will decide whether July\u2019s FOMC delivers relief or a reality check.

Powell, for his part, told lawmakers: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be in any rush, because the economy is still strong.\u201d Related Reading: Crypto Bull Run Over? Here\u2019s What A Top Trader Just Said Markets reacted by flattening the front end of the curve. Two-year Treasury yields fell to 3.806 percent, while the benchmark 10-year dipped to 4.285 percent\u2014both lows not seen since early May\u2014after the testimony and a surprise cease-fire in the Middle East turbo-charged a global \u201crisk-on\u201d bid. Yet expectations for July remain finely balanced: CME FedWatch shows that traders have whittled the probability of a first 25-basis-point cut to roughly 19%. Crypto traded the cross-currents rather than the headline. Bitcoin, which had cratered to $99,000 on Monday, reclaimed $106,000 by Wednesday morning, mirroring the rebound in equities and high-beta currencies as the dollar slumped on falling yields. Ethereum, meanwhile, held above $2,400\u2014even as Powell\u2019s tone was widely described as hawkish. The broader crypto complex moved in sympathy, with BNB punching through $644 and Solana stabilising near $146. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant Veteran traders on X distilled the stakes. Pseudonymous analyst Byzantine General wrote, \u201cWe got a lot of clarity now. All eyes on the July CPI print.\u201d Nic from CoinBureau added that July \u201cis in play\u2014maybe\u2014but nothing\u2019s locked in,\u201d as Powell\u2019s testimony brought no big surprises. Meanwhile, Jim Bianco commented: \u201cTrump appointees Waller and Bowman are suggesting a July cut. Powell is reiterating \u2018no.\u2019 Will the July FOMC meeting see at least two dissenters?\u201d For now, Powell\u2019s \u201cwatch and wait\u201d stance has bought the FOMC four more weeks of optionality. If July inflation confirms the down-trend, the policy door swings open, and the next rally for crypto could morph into a full-blown melt-up. If it doesn\u2019t, the crash could come just as fast. As Byzantine General put it, the market \u201cgot clarity.\u201d What it did not get is comfort. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,892.
