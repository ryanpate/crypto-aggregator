      "summary": "Shiba Inu has seen a surge in burn activity, with the burn rate climbing by 3,194% in the last 24 hours. According to data from burn tracker Shibburn, over 521.6 million SHIB tokens were permanently removed from circulation during this period. This sudden and sharp rise in burn rate has raised optimism within the SHIB community, although the token&#8217;s price action is struggling with bullish sentiment. Large Transactions Dominate SHIB Burn Activity As shown by data from Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn tracking website Shibburn.com, the latest burn wave was dominated by a few large transactions. A notable contributor was the wallet address beginning with &#8220;0xdb6,&#8221; which alone facilitated burns totaling over 500 million SHIB across multiple transactions to the BA-1 burn address. One of its largest single burns reached 310,744,788 SHIB, followed closely by another 107,333,061 SHIB, and then another 103,276,575 SHIB. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin \u2013 Details Other wallets also participated, including &#8220;0x28be&#8221; and &#8220;0x6176,&#8221; with each sending SHIB tokens into various burn addresses such as CA and BA-2. These contributions, although not on the same scale as the primary whale wallet, collectively helped elevate the day\u2019s total burn count to over 521 million SHIB. Together, these burn events reflect a push within the Shiba Inu community to increase SHIB burns, which had otherwise been short of noteworthy burns in recent weeks. Despite Burn Efforts, SHIB Supply Still Faces Uphill Battle Although 521 million SHIB tokens is a significant figure for a single day, it barely makes a dent in the meme token\u2019s vast circulating supply, which currently sits above 589 trillion SHIB tokens. This context relays the challenge faced by the current Shiba Inu tokenomics. Despite periods of aggressive burns like the one witnessed in the past 24 hours, the token\u2019s massive supply continues to weigh on its long-term price appreciation goals. However, the spike in burn rate is still a positive signal, particularly from a sentiment standpoint, especially now that the Shiba Inu price is struggling with sentiment. With SHIB currently trading within a tight range between $0.00001225 and $0.0000119, more Shib burns in the rest of the new week could bode well for its price action moving forward. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001192, down by 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Despite the massive uptick in burn activity, market response is somewhat muted. However, there may be more happening behind the scenes.

Although no further details were shared, past developments like the launch of Shibarium have influenced price trends. Hopefully, any new announcements could reignite interest and drive the Shiba Inu price token to new highs. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"

His simple math recalls last cycle\u2019s move from around $69k down to $15,500. Growing Demand Meets Technical Barriers Based on reports of spot ETFs and growing buys by institutions and governments, some believe the floor is firmer now.

What It Means For Investors Bitcoin\u2019s tug\u2011of\u2011war between caution and optimism is clear. On one side, pattern watchers warn of a big drop if support breaks. On the other, strong hands from big players may cushion any slide and spark a rally. Investors should keep an eye on $104k\u2013$105k for signs of weakness or strength. A break below could open the door to a move toward $23,500. Conversely, a clean break above $106k might signal the next leg up. Regardless, volatility looks set to stay high, so risk management remains key. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Ethereum has been consolidating around the $2,500 price level over the past few days, showing little momentum in either direction. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has struggled to sustain a breakout above the $2,600 resistance zone, despite the inflows into Ethereum Spot ETFs last week. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump\u2019s World Liberty Connection One event that has sparked interest, and possibly concern, among Ethereum holders is the reactivation of a dormant whale wallet holding millions worth of ETH. The sudden awakening of this long-inactive address raises questions about a potential selling pressure and its market impact. First Transaction From Dormant ETH Address Since 2015 On-chain tracker Whale Alerts was the first to report the reawakening of a pre-mined Ethereum address that had been inactive for nearly a decade. According to the large on-chain transaction tracker, the wallet, which held 2,000 ETH, initiated its last transaction 9.9 years ago. When the wallet last moved any funds in 2015, the entire stash was worth just $620. Today, that same amount is valued at over $5 million, making the owner\u2019s profit roughly 820x based on current prices. At Ethereum&#8217;s all-time high price of $4,878 in 2021, the cryptocurrencies reached an unrealized gain of 1573x. \ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 2,000 #ETH (5,063,918 USD) has just been activated after 9.9 years (worth 620 USD in 2015)!https://t.co/G0i8Rif0XX \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 14, 2025 The alert by Whale Alerts, which noted the first transaction after 9.9 years, involved the transfer of 0.0001 ETH from the whale address &#8220;0xcF26&#8221; to address &#8220;0x2C12,&#8221; which is a newly created ETH address. However, Etherscan&#8217;s on-chain transaction data reveals that the whale address sent 500 ETH into the newly created address shortly afterward. Following the string of transaction data from Etherscan shows that these 500 ETH eventually made their way into address &#8220;0x28C6,&#8221; which is known to be owned and controlled by crypto exchange Binance. This means that the 500 ETH may have already been sold through the exchange or are currently being prepared for liquidation. Brace For Impact: Will The Remaining 1,500 ETH Be Sold? As of now, the original whale address still holds approximately 1,500 ETH, currently valued at $3.796 million. However, it opens up the question of whether the rest of the funds will also be sold. Although we cannot be sure of a planned full liquidation, the pattern of the 500 ETH transfer and the involvement of an exchange address indicate that the possibility cannot be dismissed. Right now, Ethereum is in a fragile price action around the $2,500 price level. If more ETH is offloaded by the whale, the added selling pressure could make it even harder for Ethereum to break out of its current consolidation phase, especially if there isn&#8217;t enough buying pressure to absorb the ETH sold off.

If patience was a token, $XRP holders would be billionaires already. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 8, 2025 XRP Rallies As Markets Turn After a rough patch, XRP\u2019s jump has caught many off guard. The coin rocketed from roughly $0.11 at the start of November 2024 to near $0.75 by the end of January 2025. Volume ticked up on most trading platforms, suggesting fresh money is pushing the price higher. Traders who stuck it out through years of mild gains and deep dips finally saw a payoff. Seven Years Of Price Struggles From March 2017 to January 2018, XRP shot up more than 68,000%, peaking at $3.84. Based on on\u2011chain data, that blistering run led to a brutal 97% slide by March 2020, when prices hit $0.1140. In November 2020, another bounce nearly doubled the price\u2014but the US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit undercut that move, sending XRP down 67% in December 2020, its largest monthly loss ever. Holder Numbers Climb Amid Lawsuit Despite all that, the number of XRP holders kept growing. According to Santiment, about 986,000 wallets held XRP in January 2018. By December 2022, over 3.53 million new addresses had joined the network, pushing the total past 4.5 million. That surge of interest came even as many US and Canadian exchanges paused trading. It shows that newcomers and long\u2011time believers piled in while regulators and markets wrestled with the fallout. Recovery Faces Headwinds From Market Cycles While the latest rally is impressive, it comes against a mixed crypto backdrop. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown uneven strength, and overall sentiment is cautious. Some traders warn that sharp gains can trigger profit\u2011taking events, especially if the wider market cools or if the SEC lawsuit sees new twists. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump\u2019s World Liberty Connection Analysts Eye Bigger Gains Some voices in the space are setting high bars. Analyst BarriC recently said he isn\u2019t satisfied selling at $2 after years of holding. His target? A lofty $100 for XRP. That would mean a market cap rivaling the biggest tokens today. Whether that happens depends on fresh adoption, legal clarity and broader crypto health. Featured image from inkl, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solaxy-presale-burns-red-hot-as-whales-snatch-495k-in-two-days-best-presale-ends-tomorrow/",
      "summary": "With Solaxy ($SOLX) nearing the end of its presale stage, both anticipation for its listing and urgency among investors to grab the best altcoin at its lowest-ever price are higher than ever. Whale investors have gobbled up more than $500K worth of $SOLX tokens over the past 24 hours, taking Solaxy&#8217;s total presale raise to over $51M. Some of these include transactions worth $113K, $59K, and $58K. Keep reading to find out why the industry can&#8217;t keep their hands off Solana&#8217;s best crypto project yet and why buying the $SOLX presale now could be one of the smartest moves you make as a crypto investor. What&#8217;s the Hype About Solaxy? Solaxy is a new meme coin currently on presale, but it&#8217;s different from other meme cryptos in that it has a real-world application. It&#8217;s what the industry calls a utility token. $SOLX&#8217;s selling point is that it plans to restore Solana&#8217;s efficiency and performance by building the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the network. Despite its otherwise meme coin-tailored infrastructure, Solana was never designed to service a truckload of transaction requests at once. However, this is exactly what it has been asked to do ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, as well as other top trending cryptos. They flooded Solana with new investors. Thanks to Solaxy&#8217;s new L2, though, Solana&#8217;s mainnet will finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief. It will reduce the burden on the mainnet by offloading transactions onto a sidechain. As for the sidechain, think of it as an express lane on a busy highway (the L1), helping it service the extra traffic during peak hours. Optimizing Solana: Lower Fees Without Sacrificing Security In addition to creating a more scalable and efficient blockchain environment, Solaxy will also contribute to lowering investor costs on Solana. It will do so by bundling transactions into single, optimized batches. Essentially, this means that it will process multiple transactions in bulk rather than one by one, thereby lowering the cost per transaction. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Solaxy will revitalize Solana without compromising security. Its cutting-edge roll-up technology will validate the transactions on the network&#8217;s Layer 1. Solaxy&#8217;s Hyperlane Collaboration In its quest to ensure Solana occupies the center stage of the rapidly growing DeFi and Web3 space, Solaxy has joined hands with Hyperlane. Hyperlane, in case you didn&#8217;t know, is a Web3 infrastructure project that will help $SOLX make bridging (which means transferring tokens from one blockchain to another) between Solana and Ethereum easier, quicker, and more seamless. Developers, investors, and traders on Solana will, therefore, be able to transfer cryptos between Solana and Ethereum with as much ease as though they were using an everyday mobile app. And consider the enrichment this will bring to Solana and its users. Not only does Ethereum have a lot more liquidity than Solana, but it also has a huge network (over 10x that of Solana) of decentralized applications, with over 5K dApps live right now. Solaxy Presale: Your Last Chance at 11,200% Gains As mentioned earlier, Solaxy&#8217;s presale, which is currently ongoing (over $51M in funding as of now), has generated a lot of buzz among both crypto whales and retail investors alike. Solaxy&#8217;s presale officially kicked off in December 2024, with an initial per-token price of just $0.001. Through multiple presale rounds, however, one $SOLX currently stands at $0.00176. So, had you joined the best crypto presale while it was brand-new, you&#8217;d have already seen a nifty 76% increase in your investment. However, you can let bygones be bygones and make it up to your crypto portfolio by buying into the Solaxy presale now. According to our $SOLX price prediction, the token can reach a whopping $0.20 by 2030. This means you can eke out a brain-melting 11,200% return (calculated from current prices) on your investment. Here&#8217;s the most important piece of information, though: Solaxy&#8217;s presale ends in less than 24 hours from now, so this is really your last chance to grab potentially the next crypto to explode before&#8230;it explodes. Real Utility, Big Ambitions, and a Limited-Time Offer Backed by real utility, a Hyperlane partnership that promises to make it more than just a scaling tool, and bold price forecasts, Solaxy ($SOLX) could be crypto&#8217;s next big thing. Don\u2019t sit this one out; invest in Solaxy before the presale ends tomorrow. One token is currently selling for just $0.00176. However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky. This article isn&#8217;t financial advice, and we urge you to do your own research before investing."
