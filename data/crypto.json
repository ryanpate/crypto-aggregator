      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bears-back-in-control/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price has suffered a violent rejection after hitting the $110,000 level, showing a clear intention of the bears to keep the digital asset from hitting new all-time highs. So far, the rejections from $110,000 have been swift and have put the bears back in control. This has given credence to calls that the Bitcoin price will fall back below the psychological level of $100,000, something that could trigger another wave of declines in the crypto market. Bitcoin Rejection At $110,000 Part Of The Plan? The Bitcoin price rejection has no doubt triggered a wave of panic among investors, many of whom believe that this is the end of the cycle. However, a crypto analyst has suggested that the pullback is part of the larger plan as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap moves on its way to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 In the analysis, they explain that the digital asset is currently at a point where it is undergoing significant distribution, and this will explain the decline in price. The pullback in and of itself is no cause for alarm, as minor corrections after major surges are normal. In addition to this, there is a lot of accumulation going on as Bitcoin moves from the hands of old investors into the hands of new investors at a higher cost basis. The accumulation is expected to move Bitcoin into the next bullish wave. This bullish wave is the next step in the trend as the BTC price moves into place for the next price surge. Once the volume moves upward as expected, then the asset\u2019s price is expected to follow in succession. BTC Price Could Hit $130,000 Target After Breakout Going by the analyst\u2019s chart shared on the TradingView website, the Bitcoin price correction is not expected to last for long. Mainly, holding the $107,000 support becomes paramount at this level as this could set the launchpad point for the next bullish impulse. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The completion of the accumulation phase puts the next breakout level as high as $130,000, which would be an over 20% increase from the current level. However, this may not be the end as the crypto analyst has set a swing target for as high as $150,000. As for the timeline for when this could happen, the crypto analyst places a long-term target for the end of the year 2025. But there is also the possibility that the trend would be completed sooner and the Bitcoin price could reach its target and new all-time highs before the year runs out.

      "summary": "Despite failing to break out of its downtrend, ONDO could be preparing for a surge above the $2 barrier. Some analysts suggest it could repeat its 2024 playbook if it continues to hold its current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim \u2013 \u2018Up Only\u2019 Ahead? ONDO Breakout Eyes $2 ONDO, the native token of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance, is attempting to reclaim a key area amid the market pullback. Notably, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold the $1 mark since losing the area as support over three months ago. In December, the RWA token hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.14 after US President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), purchased 134,216 ONDO tokens for 250,000 USDC. This propelled ONDO\u2019s price above the $2 barrier for the first time, but the late 2024 and Q1 2025 corrections halted its bullish momentum, sending its price to the $0.60-$0.70 range. Following the late April market recovery, ONDO\u2019s price reclaimed the $0.85 area and broke out of its multi-month downtrend. The cryptocurrency then hovered between the $0.85-$1.10 levels throughout May, hitting a three-month high of $1.13 nearly a month ago. Since then, the token has been in a one-month downtrend, dipping below its local range after the recent market pullback. However, the cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim this range for the past week, hitting a one-week high of $0.92 on Wednesday. Crypto analyst World of Charts highlighted the token\u2019s performance, affirming, \u201cafter a long correction, Finally Looking Good For Midterm.\u201d As ONDO attempts to reclaim the $0.90 area, the analyst anticipates that the cryptocurrency will soon break out of its current range and the downtrend line, forecasting a 130% rally toward the $2 barrier. 2024 ATH Repeat Coming? On Thursday, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted ONDO\u2019s performance over the past year, asserting, \u201cNot sure there are many other charts looking as good on high time frames like ONDO.\u201d He explained that \u201cThe King of RWA\u201d is \u201cbasically holding a bullish structure since its launch,\u201d making a series of higher lows for over a year while maintaining its ascending support trendline. Meanwhile, analyst Alex Clay suggested that ONDO could see a parabolic run based on its performance in 2024. The market watcher noted that the token is currently accumulating at the bottom of a 15-month ascending channel, which previously served as a crucial bounce point for its rally toward its ATH. As Clay explained, after reaching the channel\u2019s upper boundary last year, ONDO saw a multi-month downtrend toward the lower boundary, before printing a higher low. This was followed by a massive rally toward the channel\u2019s top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback This year, ONDO is \u201cfollowing the Bullish Fractal from the previous year\u201d after falling to the channel\u2019s lower boundary, breaking out of the downtrend line, and registering a higher low. \u201cThese 2 reasons are more than enough to pump straight up to the channel&#8217;s top,\u201d the analyst concluded. If history repeats, the cryptocurrency could surge toward the $2.8-$3 area. At the time of writing, ONDO trades at $0.84, a 5.2% decline in the daily timeframe.

Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price Alert, Key Levels To Watch According to top crypto analyst Daan Crypto, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a narrow window after losing the range high located at $108,385. While the cryptocurrency has been able to withstand the sell-off, the analyst drew important levels to watch. As seen on the chart below, and according to the analyst, the Bitcoin price is likely to stay on its bearish course and potentially touch the mid area of its current range. This price action would put BTC at around $99,600 in the coming days. If buyers can\u2019t hold the sell pressure around this level, then BTC is more than likely to keep bleeding into its range low of $90,000. This bearish price action, the analyst clarified, would become the norm for the rest of June. Key Levels to watch as the Bitcoin price shows weakness on low timeframes. Source: Daan Crypto via X Daan Crypto stated the following regarding the Bitcoin price action: Quick move after that which was obviously &#8220;helped&#8221; by the headlines although the news was looming already with the past 48 hours of headlines which is also why price started selling of prior. I&#8217;ve said it a couple of times before but I&#8217;ll say it again. Bulls had no business going back down below $108K and I&#8217;m treating this as another deviation and move back into the larger range. This is reason enough for me to be cautious and not add on exposure that was derisked (\u2026). In this context, the analyst advised his followers to wait for clear confirmation that the bull trend is returning if Bitcoin can retake its range high around the previously mentioned level. Otherwise, the best course of action is to remain cautious. Optimism Fades as Bitcoin Aims for Lower On a separate note, trading desk QCP Group noted that the biggest risk for Bitcoin and the crypto market comes from the rising tensions between the US and China, and the growing tensions in the Middle East.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows Ethereum has just witnessed its largest daily withdrawal in over a month, a sign that may turn out to be bullish for the asset&#8217;s price. Ethereum Has Recently Seen Notable Exchange Outflows As explained by the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) in a new post on X, a large amount of Ethereum has left exchanges. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the &#8220;Exchange Netflow,&#8221; which measures the net amount of ETH entering into or exiting out of the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchanges are receiving a net number of deposits. As one of the main reasons why investors deposit their tokens to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish implication for the ETH price. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals On the other hand, the indicator being below zero suggests the exchange outflows outweigh the inflows. Such a trend can imply the holders are accumulating, which can naturally have a bullish effect on the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Sentora that shows the trend in the Ethereum Exchange Netflow over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Exchange Netflow has seen a sharp negative spike during the past day, which suggests the investors have withdrawn a significant amount of the cryptocurrency. In total, the exchanges have handled net outflows of more than 140,000 ETH (worth about $390 million) with this withdrawal spree. This is the largest single-day exit that these platforms have faced in over a month. These outflows have come as Ethereum has been attempting a breakout from its month-long range. As such, it&#8217;s possible that a portion of the large holders of the market have some level of confidence in this rally. In some other news, the cash-margined Ethereum Futures Open Interest has set a new all-time high, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in an X post. The Futures Open Interest is an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to Ethereum that are currently open on all derivatives platforms.

It comes in below art, cars and collectibles, which together amount to $27 trillion. Gold, long a trusted store of value, sits at $22 trillion. So, while Bitcoin is rare by design, it still trails behind assets with centuries of history and deep pockets on the buying side. Scarcity Fuels Price Talk With only 21 million coins ever to be mined, Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap is fixed. That has led to forecasts of big price jumps if demand keeps growing. Based on reports, some say Bitcoin could match gold\u2019s $22 trillion market cap one day. That would push a single coin past $1.15 million. Other backers warn that missing out now could mean buying in later at much higher levels, driven by FOMO\u2014fear of missing out.
