      "summary": "On-chain data shows the exchange inflows related to the stablecoins USDT and USDC have seen a sharp plunge. Here&#8217;s what this could mean for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Have Dropped Below Yearly Average In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the latest trend in the Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins in the sector, USDT and USDC. The &#8220;Exchange Inflow&#8221; refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that&#8217;s moving into the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Generally, investors may deposit their coins into these platforms when they want to trade them away, so a high value on the Exchange Inflow can indicate demand for swapping the cryptocurrency. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally be bearish for the price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level\u2014Or Risk A 30% Price Crash In the case of stablecoins, however, their price doesn&#8217;t see any impact from exchange deposits, since it always remains, by definition, stable around whatever fiat currency the asset is tracking. That said, stablecoin inflows aren&#8217;t without consequence. Investors usually deposit these assets to swap into a volatile cryptocurrency of their choice. As such, coins like Bitcoin can see a bullish effect from an Exchange Inflow spike related to these fiat-tied tokens. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Exchange Inflow of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Inflow of USDT and USDC shot up to a very high value at the end of last year, a sign that the investors were making massive deposits of these stablecoins. Alongside the spike in the indicator, the Bitcoin price observed a rally to a new all-time high (ATH), a potential sign that the stablecoin inflows may have helped provide the fuel for the run. At the peak of the spike, the metric reached a value of $131 billion per day. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that since then, the indicator has been following a downward trajectory and today, its value has come down to $70 billion per day. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls This represents a significant decline of $61 billion since the high. Though, while the indicator is indeed notably down compared to the peak, its current level is still high in the context of the wider cycle so far. Naturally, if this drawdown in the stablecoin Exchange Inflow keeps up, it could potentially turn out to be a bearish sign for Bitcoin and other digital assets. That said, even though BTC went down earlier in the year, its price is still above the $100,000 mark right now, a possible sign that investors may simply be entering a phase of consolidation. Bitcoin Price Following a surge of about 2.5% over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has managed to recover back to the $108,100 level.

Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What\u2019s Next Ethereum Eyes Range High Resistance Last week, Ethereum attempted to reclaim the $2,800 barrier, hitting a three-month high of $2,879. However, the market shakeout, fueled by the Iran-Israel conflict, sent the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to retest its local range\u2019s lows before recovering over the weekend. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $2,400-$2,680 range since the early May market recovery, which saw the King of Altcoins surge from the $1,800 mark toward its current price range for the first time in three months. Nonetheless, it has been rejected from the local range\u2019s resistance four times in the past month. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that Ethereum\u2019s price action has been consolidating between these two key levels, compressing just below the $2,800 area. This level has been a crucial area throughout the cycle, serving as a key support and resistance level since 2024. The trader considers this area to be \u201cthe most important level on this entire chart by far,\u201d detailing that every major retest of this zone has led to either \u201ca nice bounce\u201d or \u201cbig dump.\u201d Meanwhile, ETH \u201cwent on to really even further\u201d after every reclaim of this level as support. Daan explained that its current price range is \u201cbecoming quite a tight range for how long it\u2019s been trading here. You can see how important this is and that there\u2019s likely a big move coming from this point somewhere in the next few weeks.\u201d Based on this, he forecasted that \u201cIf we&#8217;d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K.\u201d However, if it loses this current range, then the $2,100 area \u201cis the big high timeframe level to watch.\u201d Is A 2017 Repeat In The Making? Merlijn The Trader highlighted that Ethereum is now consolidating within its current range after breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could soon experience a massive move. He pointed out that, historically, \u201cthis pause often precedes a surge,\u201d adding that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retesting the recent breakout zone. Additionally, the trader noted that ETH appears to be following its 2016-2017 playbook, with a similar structure to eight years ago. At the time, the cryptocurrency had an \u201cexplosive setup\u201d that led ETH to a massive lift-off starting in 2017. After the market shakeout, the cryptocurrency moved sideways within a tight range while reclaiming the 50-day Moving Average (MA).

This action is usually recorded when an asset is about to experience a massive spike in volatility, either to the upside or the downside. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum has been trading in a tight range, trapped between two critical levels. If buyers manage to push the price above the first of these levels, sitting at $2,851, then the second crypto by market cap is likely to trend to the upside. ETH price trading on a tight range on the 2 day chart. Source: Daan Crypto via X On the contrary, if sellers regain control over the ETH market, and price dips below its current levels, then the price is more likely to return to the bottom of its current range, sitting at $2,168. Daan Crypto stated the following, warning his followers on taking positions as the Ethereum price consolidates: ETH Price action is compressing right below this big $2.8K level. If we&#8217;d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K. If we do lose this current range then $2.1K is the big high timeframe level to watch. No reason to get over excited in either direction until this current consolidation/compression resolves.
