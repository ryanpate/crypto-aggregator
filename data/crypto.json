      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/buy-bitcoin-before-jackson-hole-arthur-hayes/",
      "summary": "Arthur Hayes has published a new essay, \u201cQuid Pro Stablecoin,\u201d arguing that the United States\u2019 sudden political enthusiasm for bank-issued stablecoins is less about \u201cfinancial freedom\u201d and more about arming the Treasury with a multi-trillion-dollar \u201cliquidity bazooka.\u201d The former BitMEX chief\u2014writing in his personal newsletter\u2014contends that investors who postpone buying Bitcoin until the Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing will serve as \u201cexit liquidity\u201d for those who bought earlier. How The Money Printer Is Already Warming Up At the core of Hayes\u2019 thesis is the claim that eight \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d banks hold roughly $6.8 trillion in demand and time deposits that can be transformed into on-chain dollars. Once customers migrate from legacy accounts to bank stablecoins\u2014he cites JPMorgan\u2019s forthcoming \u201cJPMD\u201d token as the template\u2014those deposits become collateral that can be recycled into Treasury bills. \u201cAdoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power,\u201d he writes, adding that the product simultaneously slashes compliance overhead because \u201can AI agent trained on the corpus of relevant compliance regulations can perfectly ensure that certain transactions are never approved.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Hayes layers a second mechanism on top of the stablecoin flow. If Congress strips the Federal Reserve of its ability to pay interest on reserve balances\u2014a proposal floated by Senator Ted Cruz\u2014banks would have to replace that lost income by buying short-dated Treasuries. He estimates the policy could \u201cliberate another $3.3 trillion of inert reserves,\u201d bringing the prospective fire-power for government debt purchases to $10.1 trillion. \u201cThis $10.1 trillion liquidity injection will act upon risky assets in the same way Bad Gurl Yellen\u2019s $2.5 trillion injection did\u2026 PUMP UP THE JAM!\u201d Hayes asserts. The essay frames the bipartisan GENIUS Act as the legislative linchpin. By barring non-banks from issuing interest-bearing stablecoins, Washington \u201chands the stablecoin market to banks,\u201d ensuring that fintech issuers such as Circle cannot compete at scale and that deposit flight is funneled into the institutions most likely to bankroll the Treasury. Hayes calculates that the cost savings and enhanced net-interest margins could increase the combined market capitalisation of the big banks by more than 180 percent, a trade he describes as \u201cnon-consensus\u201d but executable \u201cin SIZE.\u201d Buy Bitcoin Before The Fed Blinks Despite his long-term enthusiasm, Hayes cautions that a temporary liquidity drain looms once Congress passes what he labels Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill.\u201d Refilling the Treasury General Account to its $850 billion target could contract dollar liquidity by nearly half a trillion dollars, an impulse he believes may knock Bitcoin back toward the mid-$90,000s and keep prices range-bound until the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole conference in late August. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases \u201cI believe that between now and the August Jackson Hole Fed speech to be given by beta cuck towel bitch boy Jerome Powell, the market will trade sideways to slightly lower. If the TGA refill proves to be dollar liquidity negative, then the downside is $90,000 to $95,000. If the refill proves to be a nothingburger, Bitcoin will chop in the $100,000s without a decisive break above the $112,000 all-time-high,\u201d Hayes writes. The punchline, however, is resolutely bullish. Hayes ridicules advisers steering clients into bonds on the premise that yields will fall: \u201cIf you\u2019re still waiting for Powell to whisper \u2018QE infinity\u2019 in your ear before you go risk-on, congrats \u2014 you\u2019re the exit liquidity. Instead go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.\u201d In his view, the political machinery that props up US deficits has already selected bank stablecoins as the next round of stealth quantitative easing, and Bitcoin\u2014alongside JPMorgan stock\u2014is positioned to absorb the spill-over. Hayes signs off with a stark imperative: \u201cDon\u2019t sit on the sidelines waiting for Powell to bless the bull market.\u201d The liquidity horse, he argues, has already bolted; investors who hesitate to buy Bitcoin risk being trampled beneath it. \u201cYou will miss out on Bitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million,\u201d he concludes.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-surges-above-key-0-17-mark-token6900-set-to-explode/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin climbed above $109K, triggering a surge across the markets: Ethereum ($ETH) \u2013 up 4.65% XRP ($XRP) \u2013 up 3.86% Solana ($SOL) \u2013 up 7.85% Tron ($TRX) \u2013 up 4.17% But one of the biggest daily surges came from an unexpected corner, as Dogecoin mounted an 8% rally and broke the key $0.17 mark. As meme coins rebound, could the purest meme coin of them all be poised to hit the stratosphere? Time for a closer look. What\u2019s Driving the Rally? A wave of optimism around potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts, prompted by recent dovish statements from key officials, energized risk assets. Overall, markets are bullish and tokens are up for a number of reasons. Approvals of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signaled increased institutional interest, especially in altcoins. Greater clarity in US crypto regulation is drawing fresh capital into the market. Growing TradFi and DeFi convergence \u2013 including banking applications for key crypto institutions \u2013 has lowered barriers to entry while increasing a sense of trust. There\u2019s still uncertainty, especially ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s expected employment report on July 3. But for now, positivity reigns, and traders clamor for more gains. Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, noted, \u2018Bitcoin is in the passenger seat\u2026 Recent crypto ETP approvals may be raising investor confidence that TradFi capital will make its way into altcoins.\u2019 He expects new token highs later in the year, and it&#8217;s not just Bitcoin we&#8217;re talking about. Wider Market Backdrop Still Positive for Key Crypto Players US equity benchmarks like Nasdaq and the S&#38;P 500 also ticked up, with the S&#38;P 500 hitting an all-time high. However, geopolitical and fiscal uncertainties \u2013 such as the delayed U.S. budget, ongoing global trade tensions, and regional conflicts \u2013 remain a constant worry for investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows on July 1, suggesting some caution, though that was the first day in a 15-day streak of inflows. Ripple\u2019s application for a national bank charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) marked another sign of growing institutional integration. And President Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement of a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal may boost broader risk-on sentiment. All told, it\u2019s no surprise that Dogecoin made a strong push \u2013 and could be forming the base for another surge to $0.19 or beyond. A strong performance from the world\u2019s biggest meme coin creates a favorable environment for the purest, simplest, strongest meme coin presale \u2013 Token6900 ($T6900). Token6900 ($T6900) \u2013 All Meme, All the Time First there was the SPX6900 token, a meme with no utility, just a $1.2B market cap. It\u2019s up 4.3% in the past week, kicking butt and taking names. Now there\u2019s Token6900 ($T6900), with even less utility but more&#8230;tokens? Yes, it has one more token than SPX6900. Talk about pettiness, right? The project is pure meme coin madness, all mood and all vibe. And it\u2019s all potential, too \u2013 the potential to ride the growing meme market to unprecedented heights. The truth of $T6900 is that it isn\u2019t just another meme coin \u2013 it\u2019s the most literal meme coin possible. The truth is the meme, and the meme is truth. There\u2019s no hiding, no fancy promises of future utility \u2013 just a meme, a presale, and slaptastic potential. True meme coin aficionados are already buying in; the presale has raised over $191K in a matter of days, with tokens priced at only $0.006425. Visit the Token6900 presale page to learn more. Memes Ready to Make Bank in Bullish Markets Crypto markets are currently buoyed by encouraging macro signals, institutional momentum, and regulatory progress. While underlying uncertainties persist, the prevailing sentiment leans toward upside \u2013 and Token6900 taps into that outlook to unleash pure meme coin momentum. Do your own research \u2013 this isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) has recently experienced a significant resurgence, reaching a three-week high of $2,600 after a notable spike on Wednesday. This uptick comes at a time when a key company is considering ETH as a potential treasury reserve asset, underscoring renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. Forecasting $7,000 Potential Despite being one of the poorer performers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a year-to-date decline of 24%, Ethereum&#8217;s recent 6% surge has allowed it to outpace competitors, including Bitcoin (BTC), which is close to its all-time high. Crypto analyst Alek Carter has also expressed a bullish outlook on Ethereum (ETH), drawing parallels between the current price patterns and those observed in 2020. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases He describes the recent movements in ETH\u2019s chart as reminiscent of the &#8220;dead cat bounce&#8221; phenomenon\u2014a term used to describe a temporary recovery in price after a significant decline\u2014followed by a final retest before a substantial upward trend. Carter points out that Ethereum underwent a similar trajectory in 2020, where it initially experienced a dip before rebounding sharply to reach a peak of over $3,500. He believes that the recent completion of what he terms the &#8220;final retest&#8221; suggests that Ethereum is poised for another significant rally. If the current setup mirrors the previous cycle, Carter anticipates that ETH could potentially reach a new high of $7,000. Bullish Sentiment For Ethereum The bullish sentiment surrounding ETH is further reflected in the performance of stocks associated with the cryptocurrency. BitMine, a Bitcoin mining company that recently announced plans to make ETH its primary treasury reserve, saw its stock soar by about 20%, with an increase of over 1,000% since the announcement. Similarly, SharpLink Gaming, which has adopted an ETH treasury strategy, experienced an 11% rise, while Bit Digital, which shifted its focus from Bitcoin mining to Ethereum treasury and staking, gained more than 6%. Moreover, the recent interest in ETH is evident in the performance of Ethereum ETFs, which saw inflows of $40 million on Tuesday, led by BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Ethereum Trust. A Experts also highlight that ETH&#8217;s smart contract capabilities have established it as a leading platform for the tokenization of traditional assets, including US dollar-pegged stablecoins. The &#8216;Backbone&#8217; Of Stablecoins? Fundstrat&#8217;s Tom Lee characterized Ethereum as &#8220;the backbone and architecture&#8221; of stablecoins, given that issuers like Tether (USDT) and Circle&#8217;s USD Coin (USDC) operate on its network. Additionally, BlackRock&#8217;s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL, launched on Ethereum last year. Tokenization itself represents a transformative process, allowing digital representations of publicly traded securities and real-world assets to be issued on blockchain networks. While holders of tokenized assets do not possess outright ownership, the mechanism opens up new avenues for investment and asset management. Related Reading: Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy Set To Yield $14 Billion Profit In Q2, Bloomberg The latest wave of interest in Ethereum and related assets follows Robinhood&#8217;s announcement to enable trading of tokenized US stocks and ETFs across Europe. This development comes on the heels of a growing interest in stablecoins, spurred by Circle&#8217;s IPO and the Senate&#8217;s passage of the GENIUS Act, a proposed stablecoin bill that aims to provide a new framework for these assets to integrate in the broader financial landscape.

      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) has surged 7.5% in the daily timeframe to break above a key resistance level for the first time in weeks. Following its breakout, some analysts forecasted that a retest of the range highs could be around the corner. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter Ethereum Reclaims Crucial Area On Wednesday, Ethereum jumped over 7% from its local low to the $2,550 mark, setting the stage to reclaim another crucial resistance. The King of Altcoins climbed from the $2,380 support to the $2,585 area, hitting a two-week high. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $2,400-$2,800 price range since the early May breakout, but briefly lost this area after failing to hold the $2,550 support two weeks ago. After recovering its local range, ETH struggled to break past the $2,500 barrier, trading between the range low and this resistance for a week. Nonetheless, today\u2019s market recovery, which also saw Bitcoin jump to the $109,600 mark, has sparked bullish sentiment among investors. Amid today\u2019s performance, Daan Crypto Trades called ETH\u2019s price action a \u201cnice move out of the local range.\u201d However, he suggested that bulls must hold the $2,520 area to confirm it isn\u2019t another deviation or liquidity grab in a \u201cbigger chop.\u201d To the trader, failing to hold this area would send the cryptocurrency to the range lows again. As a result, the major levels to watch remain the $2,310 support and $2,735 resistance. Market watcher Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum has \u201crespected support every single time,\u201d forming \u201cone of the cleanest breakouts we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He highlighted a three-month ascending triangle in ETH\u2019s chart, pointing out that the King of Altcoins bounced from the rising support line during the recent price deviation and now targets the next key resistance around the $2,700 mark. Ethereum is charging up. Higher lows, strong base, bullish MACD crossover. A clean break of $2,700\u2026 and ETH will fly. $3,000 is just the beginning. The real move comes after that. ETH To Repeat ATH Set Up? Merlijn also affirmed that ETH\u2019s two-year setup is repeating, which could signal that a massive breakout is coming. According to the chart, the Ethereum price has moved in stages that last about two years since 2018. During the first stage, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price forms a base, which later leads to the second stage, where the price rejects and retests the base lows. Lastly, Ethereum experiences the liftoff phase, where the price breaks out to new highs. The last liftoff phase, between 2020 and 2022, saw ETH surge from the $100 mark to its $4,878 all-time high (ATH). To the trader, \u201cThis time we start from $1,500. Not a dip. A launchpad.\u201d Similarly, analyst Kaleo pointed out the structural resemblance between ETH\u2019s performance this cycle and last cycle. He noted that, while BTC hit a new ATH in December 2020, Ethereum was 60% down from its previous cycle highs, leading many investors to suggest it was \u201cdead.\u201d Related Reading: Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout Nonetheless, ETH climbed over 800% from there, outperforming Bitcoin\u2019s 250% increase in the following months. This time, the cryptocurrency has also seen up to a 68% retrace from its previous ATH, while BTC soared to new highs. If history repeats, \u201cThe bottom for ETH is in. Up only from here,\u201d the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,568, a 6.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.
