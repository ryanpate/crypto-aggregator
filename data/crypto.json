      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/stablecoin/erc-20-stablecoin-supply-hits-all-time-high-at-121b-liquidity-on-the-rise/",
      "summary": "While Bitcoin struggles to break above its all-time high and altcoins face difficulty finding solid support, one corner of the crypto market continues to expand: stablecoins. Since the beginning of the bull run, the stablecoin market has shown consistent growth, cementing its reputation as one of crypto\u2019s most reliable and scalable use cases. Unlike volatile assets, stablecoins offer stability, liquidity, and utility across DeFi, trading, and settlement. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens \u2013 Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Darkfost recently shared fresh data and highlighted a key development many have overlooked \u2014 the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins is rising again. As of today, it has reached a new all-time high of $121 billion. This milestone signals renewed demand and liquidity entering the crypto ecosystem, at a time when other sectors appear stagnant. The rise in stablecoin supply underscores the sector\u2019s resilience and importance. While speculative tokens face resistance, stablecoins thrive on utility and adoption. Whether for hedging, yield strategies, or capital movement, their role in crypto remains foundational. As the broader market waits for its next move, the silent growth in stablecoin supply could be an early signal of renewed momentum across the board. The stablecoin narrative is far from over \u2014 in fact, it may just be starting. Stablecoin Growth Accelerates: On-Chain Data Points To Renewed Liquidity Stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in crypto, creating a vital bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This narrative gained massive traction in June when Circle (NASDAQ: CRCL), the company behind USDC, went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Initially priced at $31 per share, Circle\u2019s IPO exceeded all expectations \u2014 closing the day at $82.84, marking a 167% gain. Today, CRCL trades nearly six times above its IPO price, giving the company a $42 billion market cap and reinforcing confidence in the stablecoin business model. On-chain insights shared by Darkfost add another layer to the story. According to the data, the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins has started rising again and just hit a new all-time high of $121 billion. ERC-20 stablecoins are cryptocurrencies built on the Ethereum blockchain that follow the ERC-20 token standard. They are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI). This surge in supply is critical because stablecoins are minted on demand \u2014 their issuance directly reflects user demand and fresh liquidity entering the system. This expanding supply meets the needs of protocols and exchanges that face rising user activity and capital inflows. While market sentiment remains cautious, if the stablecoin supply continues to grow, it would signal renewed risk appetite and capital deployment. In that case, stablecoins may once again serve as the early catalyst for the next major phase in the crypto bull cycle. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low \u2013 Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Dominance Hovers Below 8%: A Neutral Yet Strategic Positioning The weekly chart shows stablecoin dominance currently sitting at 7.90%, a level that reflects cautious but sustained interest in liquidity reserves across the crypto market. After a sharp climb between 2020 and mid-2022\u2014when stablecoin dominance peaked above 16% during risk-off periods\u2014dominance has gradually declined, aligning with risk-on rotations into Bitcoin and altcoins during bull runs. However, since early 2024, dominance has consolidated between 7% and 10%, signaling a more balanced environment. The current level remains just above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages (7.76% and 8.02%, respectively), suggesting strong horizontal support. Meanwhile, the 200-week moving average at 9.30% acts as a long-term ceiling. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical This neutral position implies that market participants are neither fully risk-on nor risk-off. If dominance rises from here, it could either reflect increased fear (capital flowing out of volatile assets) or fresh liquidity entering the market, especially if paired with a rise in stablecoin supply, which we\u2019re already witnessing with ERC-20 tokens.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-reclaim-key-trendline/",
      "summary": "The altcoin market is flashing a familiar signal that preceded its most explosive rallies in the past. After months of uncertainty and price consolidation, a new analysis suggests that altcoins have just reclaimed a critical trendline\u2014the same one that marked the beginning of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. With market patterns aligning and fractals emerging, analysts are now questioning whether the conditions are once again ripe for a massive altcoin breakout. Altcoins Eye Vertical Move As Bear Trap Ends The altcoin market may be on the brink of a historic breakout, according to a recent chart analysis by crypto expert Merlijn The Trader. The analyst draws parallels between the current cycle and those of 2017 and 2021. The analyst\u2019s chart, published on X social media, shows that the total altcoin market capitalization has reclaimed a long-term ascending trendline that had preceded previous vertical expansions during major bull runs. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says In earlier cycles, altcoins briefly broke this trendline in what was identified as a \u201cbear trap\u201d before swiftly reversing and launching into explosive growth phases. Merlijin The Trader reveals that this pattern appears to be repeating in this cycle, as the current market structure mirrors previous setups that triggered rapid valuation increases across the altcoin sector. The ascending trendline recovery is framed within a red box in the chart, consistent with the zones that marked the end of prior downtrends. In each instance, the reclaim was followed by aggressive upward movement, highlighted by green boxes that represented parabolic gains in the total market cap. Merlijn The Trader suggests that the recent rebound indicates the completion of another bear trap, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Green arrows placed below the price curve, matching the timing of previous breakouts within the analyst\u2019s chart, imply that the altcoin market could be preparing for another phase of expansion. If the historical fractal holds, the analyst forecasts a sharp vertical rally for altcoins, with valuations possibly reaching the $10-$16 trillion range. Altcoin Market Mirror 2016-2018 Breakout Setup In another fresh analysis, Merlijn The Trader noted that the altcoin market cap is showing signs of repeating a historical pattern that previously led to a major bull rally. A comparison between the 2016-2018 market cycle and the current one reveals an almost identical structure playing out, albeit on a much larger scale. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Holds Altcoin Season At Bay, Analyst Says No Upside Until This Happens The market appears to have formed a Double Bottom, followed by a mid-cycle correction and consolidation within a descending broadening wedge pattern. This same fractal unfolded before the explosive altcoin rally in 2017. The analyst\u2019s chart also illustrates that in the previous cycle, altcoins broke out of this same wedge pattern, resulting in a massive surge in market capitalization, which he referred to as \u201cPump 2.0\u201d. With the same breakout now confirmed for this cycle\u2019s market structure, Merlijn The Trader predicts that the altcoin sector may be entering its next parabolic expansion phase. This development could mark the end of the altcoin market&#8217;s current bear phase and the beginning of a second macro pump similar to what occurred between 2017 and early 2018.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-turns-key-resistance-into-support-momentum-builds-for-range-breakout/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is consolidating above the $2,500 mark, showing resilience amid broader market uncertainty. While bulls have successfully flipped $2,500 from resistance into support, the price still faces significant pressure below the $2,700 zone. This range-bound behavior has persisted since early May, and the coming days are likely to define the next major move, not only for ETH but also for the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens \u2013 Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s current structure, particularly after the $2,500 level was reclaimed. However, the next challenge lies in reclaiming the range high. A breakout above this key resistance could trigger a strong bullish continuation and potentially ignite an altseason, as capital often rotates into altcoins once ETH gains momentum. On the flip side, failure to sustain current support may open the door for a pullback toward lower demand levels. For now, bulls appear to be in control, but the market remains on edge, awaiting a decisive move. Whether ETH can build enough strength to break through resistance or slips into another leg of consolidation will likely shape sentiment and positioning for the weeks ahead. Ethereum Builds Strength As It Eyes Range High Ethereum continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation zone, oscillating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. After reclaiming the $2,500 level and flipping it into support, ETH now looks poised for a potential breakout. Ted Pillows highlighted this shift in momentum, stating that Ethereum is \u201clooking good\u201d and could soon revisit the upper boundary of the range. However, despite Ethereum\u2019s strength, broader market conditions remain mixed. Bitcoin\u2019s failure to break above its all-time high adds pressure to the crypto market, and altcoins continue to struggle to find solid footing. While macroeconomic uncertainty has eased following encouraging job reports and legislative developments in the US, headwinds persist. Rising US Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing delay in cutting interest rates contribute to a cautious environment. Still, Ethereum\u2019s ability to hold above $2,500 suggests bullish intent. If price pushes toward and ultimately breaks above $2,700, it could trigger a broader move across altcoins, reawakening market momentum. But without a breakout in the short term, another leg of consolidation\u2014or even a pullback\u2014remains possible. This week may prove pivotal in setting the tone for Ethereum and the altcoin market\u2019s next phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical ETH Tests Resistance As Consolidation Tightens Ethereum is trading at $2,550, holding above its key moving averages and continuing to consolidate in a tight range. The daily chart shows that ETH is attempting to break above the 200-day moving average (red), currently sitting near $2,488, while managing to stay above both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages. This convergence of key technical levels highlights the current equilibrium between bulls and bears. Despite multiple attempts since early May, Ethereum has not been able to sustain a breakout above the $2,700 mark. Each push higher has faced selling pressure, suggesting that this zone remains a major area of resistance. However, recent price action shows higher lows and strong defense of the $2,500 level, signaling building momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low \u2013 Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Trading volume remains relatively flat, which aligns with the ongoing consolidation, but could also foreshadow a volatility spike once direction is confirmed. A successful daily close above the $2,600\u2013$2,700 zone could trigger an impulsive move toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a breakdown below the $2,480 level would invalidate the bullish structure and shift sentiment. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-etf-inflows-8-streak-institutions-buying/",
      "summary": "Data shows the US Ethereum spot ETFs have seen net inflows for eight consecutive weeks now, a sign of continued institutional demand. Ethereum Spot ETF Netflow Remains Positive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the weekly netflow for the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of Ethereum has been looking. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. These ETFs trade on the traditional platforms, so they allow for an easier investment method for those who find cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets overwhelming to navigate. Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the American Ethereum spot ETFs have been doing lately: From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the netflow related to the Ethereum spot ETFs has recently been on a green streak. This means that inflows into wallets attached to the ETFs are continuously happening. Last week saw a net inflow of 61,000 ETH, worth $157.3 million at the current exchange rate. With these inflows, the spot ETFs of the cryptocurrency have seen positive values for eight straight weeks. Since institutional investors generally take this investment route into Ethereum, the continuous inflows could be a sign of sustained demand from them. Despite this interest, the ETH price has remained locked in a phase of sideways movement. Ethereum isn&#8217;t the only asset that&#8217;s observing demand on the ETFs. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has pointed out in an X post, Bitcoin has also been enjoying net inflows. As displayed in the above chart, the Bitcoin ETFs have seen a positive netflow on 16 out of the last 17 trading days. The one exception was on July 1st, when outflows occurred. In some other news, Ethereum has observed new on-chain capital inflows during the past week, as Glassnode has revealed in another X post. In the graph, the data for the Realized Cap of coins aged less than 1 week is shown for Ethereum and Solana. The &#8220;Realized Cap&#8221; measures the amount of capital that the investors have put into a given network. The version of the metric of focus here specifically calculates the capital that has come in over the past week. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the metric has seen an increase for both ETH and SOL during the past week, indicating fresh capital has flowed in.

      "summary": "The Bitcoin market appears to be coiling for a major move, according to prominent crypto analyst CrediBull Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), who highlighted today via X that over 80% of all Bitcoin in existence is currently being held by long-term investors\u2014levels of supply constraint previously seen only at major inflection points in Bitcoin\u2019s price history. Why No One\u2019s Selling Bitcoin In his post, CrediBull noted, \u201cThe only 2 times in Bitcoin&#8217;s 15 year history that this % was higher was at 43k before a $30,000 impulse to 73k and at 58k before a $50,000 impulse to 105k+.\u201d Drawing on this historical precedent, he concluded that the market is poised for another massive leg up: \u201cWhen the majority of $BTC total circulating supply is cornered by \u2018diamond hands\u2019, price moves up aggressively at the hint of any \u2018new\u2019 demand.\u201d With &#8220;excess&#8221; supply now redistributed to long-term holders and institutional entities such as Bitcoin treasury companies increasingly taking the lead, the analyst sees a clear signal: \u201cThe next impulse IS IMMINENT. This next one will also likely be even bigger than the last two ($50,000+). Who&#8217;s ready for 150k+ Bitcoin?\u201d Related Reading: 2025\u2019s Biggest Bitcoin Bull Trigger Is Still Hidden, Expert Reveals The optimism is not without a technical underpinning. In a previous post, CrediBull addressed the current market structure and his own Elliott Wave-based scenario planning: \u201cMy original count/idea shared a few days ago had us rejecting at range highs above 110k and seeing a pullback down to the BLUE zone at 102k-ish before moving sideways for a few more weeks before the next impulse begins.\u201dHowever, the analyst acknowledged a significant alternative possibility: \u201cI do still think this scenario is probable, I also recognize that there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun (most bullish scenario depicted).\u201d Given the price action and structure, CrediBull argued that the risk-reward profile no longer favors bearish positioning. \u201cIn either case, downside is relatively limited on Bitcoin from current levels imo and so focus should be on identifying potential long opps on Bitcoin rather than looking to short clear strength.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut\u2014What You Need To Know He punctuated the point with a rhetorical jab: \u201cWhy is it now illegal to short Bitcoin? Because there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun.\u201d Adding a layer of technical confirmation, analyst Axel Adler Jr provided a concurrent signal from volatility metrics. Adler pointed to a significant Bollinger Bands squeeze underway, writing: \u201cThe range between the upper and lower boundaries has fallen to 7.7%\u2014one of the lowest values throughout the entire bull cycle.\u201d Such compressions in volatility historically precede large directional moves. Adler explained, \u201cThe decrease in volatility indicates energy accumulation in the market; the price is ready for a rally, and in an upward trend environment, the chances of an upward breakout are significantly higher.\u201d In the current cycle, Adler has identified six episodes of such squeezes. Four were immediately followed by strong price appreciation, while the remaining two saw brief corrections before continuing upward. The takeaway: \u201cBased on this experience, the current squeeze most likely foreshadows another upward impulse, although a small consolidation before the move is also not ruled out.\u201d With long-term holders now controlling an overwhelming share of supply, bullish technical compression in play, and institutional adoption continuing to absorb circulating coins, the environment CrediBull describes echoes past moments of explosive upside. While nothing is guaranteed, the combination of on-chain metrics and technical indicators suggest Bitcoin\u2019s next chapter may already be beginning\u2014quietly, beneath the surface.
