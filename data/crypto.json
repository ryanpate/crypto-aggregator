      "summary": "Shaun Donelly knows a hot item when he sees one \u2013 and Bitcoin\u2019s the hottest item of them all. The CEO of the Lingerie Fighting Championship plans to build the company\u2019s own Bitcoin treasury, and he\u2019s taking inspiration from an unlikely source: GameStop. Is this a flash in the pan, or is the Lingerie Fighting Championship onto something? And what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin treasuries \u2013 and for innovative applications of the blockchain? From GameStop, to Strategy, and Back Again Remember the glory days of GameStop stonks? Back when Robinhood, the trading platform, and GameStop were household names, at least for a certain sector of the trading populace. Since the heady days of $81.25 $GME stock, back in 2021, GameStop has largely trundled along, doing its own thing. Over the past year, it traded in a fairly narrow range, up a little under 5%. But GameStop did make a big splash a few weeks ago, when it announced that it was taking a step back from Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy approach, and would be amassing its own Bitcoin treasury. Ironically, back in 2020 and 2021, when $GME was soaring, Michael Saylor had already started to take the approach with (Micro)Strategy that would make him famous, purchasing Bitcoin early and often. And as Bitcoin\u2019s price rose, Strategy\u2019s strategy paid off. So when GameStop announced that it would follow in Saylor\u2019s footsteps, some heads turned. And without further ado, GameStop purchased 4,170 Bitcoin. GameStop Inspires LFC Back to Shaun Donelly. The LFC CEO watched GameStop make its big Bitcoin purchase and decided to follow suit. To that end, the LFC will purchase $230K of Bitcoin in the next month; they plan to spend up to $2M in the next six months. The move comes ahead of a series of first-ever UK shows, with key fighters in the LFC ready to take the stage. It\u2019s not a trendsetting move, but rather one that follows a Bitcoin treasury strategy that has been adopted by companies both large and small alike, and even by the US government itself. And there\u2019s every sign that GameStop isn\u2019t done \u2013 the company has $450M of a potential $2.25B ready to deploy to bolster its Bitcoin supply, according to a recent SEC filing. Donelly hopes that his company can tap into the same energy Strategy did, and maybe even a bit of the same profit over the next decade; since making its first Bitcoin purchase, $MSTR stock is up 3,170%. There\u2019s another project in the works that aims to take advantage of the healthy crypto climate. SUBBD Token aims to spice up the $85B content creation market with a combination of AI + blockchain. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) \u2013 Bringing Fans and Creators Together with $SUBBD The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is another red-hot commodity. The SUBBD platform unleashes AI content management and production, bringing both together in one place for the first time. Creators gain new ways to connect with their fans, who can use $SUBBD to access exclusive content and receive subscription discounts. At the same time, the $SUBBD platform offers several AI tools, including: \u2705 AI profile creation \u2705 AI voice notes \u2705 AI video generator \u2705 AI livestream The entire suite can be used to boost AI influencers and to manage content from human creators. And with $SUBBD, both fans and creators alike can token-gate exclusive content to create new and more personal ways of interacting. The SUBBD Token presale, now on, has raised over $714K so far.

From SUBBD to the LFC From GameStop to MicroStrategy and now to the Lingerie Fighting Championship, the Bitcoin treasury strategy continues to ripple across unexpected sectors. Shaun Donelly\u2019s $2M commitment to BTC might seem unconventional, but it reflects a broader realization: Bitcoin \u2013 and crypto more broadly \u2013 is no longer fringe; it\u2019s foundational. Projects like SUBBD Token are capitalizing on blockchain\u2019s flexibility, merging AI, content creation, and fan engagement in powerful new ways.

Tom Lee Appointed Chairman At BitMine Lee\u2019s appointment comes alongside an ambitious plan to raise $250 million in a private placement aimed at implementing a strategy that positions Ethereum as the primary treasury reserve asset, while still maintaining its core Bitcoin mining operations. This initiative reflects a growing trend within the financial services sector, where the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency is gaining momentum, further highlighted by President Trump\u2019s decision to establish a strategic crypto reserve. Related Reading: Solana Forms Bullish Flag On Daily Chart \u2014 Breakout Imminent? Lee highlighted this shift during an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d stating, \u201cThe financial services industry and crypto are converging, and it really started with stablecoins.\u201d Lee likened stablecoins to the &#8220;ChatGPT of crypto,&#8221; emphasizing their widespread adoption among consumers, businesses, and financial institutions, including major players like Visa. Interestingly, stablecoins have gained a major victory in Congress last week with the passage of the GENIUS Act which aims to provide a new regulatory framework for these crypto assets. Transforming Into An Ethereum Treasury Powerhouse According to Lee, Ethereum serves as the foundational architecture for stablecoins, making it crucial for BitMine to accumulate ETH in order to influence and secure its position within the network. The company&#8217;s strategy will include monitoring the value of Ethereum held per share as a key performance metric, akin to Strategy&#8217;s (previouisly MicroStrategy) well-known \u201cBTC Yield\u201d metric for Bitcoin. During his interview, Lee explained that BitMine plans to enhance the value of ETH per share through reinvestment of cash flows, capital market activities, and the appreciation of Ethereum itself. As more companies explore treasury management strategies beyond Bitcoin, BitMine is not alone in its pivot. It joins other firms like SharpLink Gaming, which initiated its own Ethereum treasury strategy earlier this year, and DeFi Development, which is focusing on Solana.

BitMine&#8217;s stock, trading under the ticker name BMNR, also saw a major surge on Monday closing the day at $33.90 per share.

      "summary": "XRP has slipped the leash that has restrained it since the mid-January peak at $3.40, with the latest weekly candle closing a fraction above the descending trend-line that has defined the upper boundary of its six month trendline. At press time the token is quoting $2.22 on major spot venues, having tagged an intraday high of $2.31 a few hours after the weekly open. XRP Flashes Triple Breakout The technical alignment behind today\u2019s move is unusually tight. The price itself has edged through trend-line resistance traced from the 16 January swing high, but the same behaviour is evident beneath the surface. On the momentum pane the weekly relative-strength index, muted since late March, has poked above its own falling resistance line at 54, ending a sequence of lower RSI highs that mirrored each failed rally in price. A similar story is unfolding on the WaveTrend Oscillator: the fast and slow signal lines have curled upward and printed a tentative positive cross just below the zero-line. Taken together, the trifecta\u2014price above pennant roof, RSI above trend-line, WTO signals turning\u2014constitutes what technicians refer to as confluence: three independent tools broadcasting the same directional bias on the same timeframe. The only missing ingredient is conviction in volume. Seasoned chart-watchers will want to see that metric expand in the coming sessions to validate the move. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 Independent analyst Maelius (@MaeliusCrypto), who posted the chart that first drew the community\u2019s attention, summed up the state of play in a single line: \u201cXRP teasing us with a breakout! Asking for volume to follow!\u201d The plea is well-placed. Trendline resolutions that lack a parallel surge in activity are prone to fail-back tests; a decisive influx of bids is required to flip the freshly conquered trend-line into reliable support. Support for the bullish case is also visible on slower-moving gauges. The 50-week exponential moving average now rises through $1.84, its steepest positive slope in more than two years, and the current candle sits comfortably above that long-term trend proxy. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure\u2014Analyst Says \u2018Fireworks Ahead\u2019 Should the breakout hold and attract the liquidity Maelius is watching for, classical chart theory projects an initial objective near the midpoint of January\u2019s supply shelf around $3.00. A weekly close back beneath the trend-line, by contrast, would neutralise the pattern and expose the high-volume node at the demand zone near $2.0 and the $1.84 price tag if bears regain momentum. For now the market is balanced on the knife-edge between promise and proof. Price, RSI and WTO have all stepped over their respective fault lines; only the tape itself remains to confirm that traders are prepared to follow through. Whether this triple breakout marks the beginning of XRP\u2019s next leg higher\u2014or merely another feint within a larger consolidation\u2014will be determined in the sessions ahead.

      "summary": "Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the leading corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), is on the verge of reaching a significant milestone as it approaches the acquisition of 600,000 tokens. In its latest move, the company purchased 4,980 Bitcoin between June 23 and June 29 for an average price of $106,801 each, totaling approximately $531.9 million. This latest purchase has brought the company\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325, acquired for around $42.4 billion. Strategy Shares Surge 4.7% Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s price remaining relatively stable at around $107,000 and $107,500 over the past 24 hours, Strategy&#8217;s shares, MSTR, increased by 4.7% to $402.07 on Monday, reflecting investor confidence in the company&#8217;s financial moves. The value of Strategy&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings now stands at roughly $64 billion. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure\u2014Analyst Says \u2018Fireworks Ahead\u2019 Funding for these latest acquisitions came through the sale of stock under various at-the-market offerings. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer noted that the company&#8217;s Bitcoin yield, which measures the change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to total shares outstanding, was 19.7% between January 1 and June 29. Strategy&#8217;s Chairman, Michael Saylor, who is often regarded as one of Bitcoin&#8217;s most vocal advocates, hinted at the recent purchase in a social media post over the weekend. He stated, \u201cIn 21 years, you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d bought more,\u201d alongside a chart illustrating the performance of Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin portfolio since its initial investment in late 2020, which shows the aggressive purchases that have increased over the past year. Bitcoin Price Hovers Around $107,000 Interestingly, the company had made a smaller purchase of 245 Bitcoins between June 16 and June 22, considerably less than its usual massive acquisitions. For context, Strategy had previously acquired 10,100 Bitcoins in just six days during the period from June 9 to June 15. This shows that while the company often makes large purchases, it can also vary its acquisition strategy based on market conditions. Over the past month, the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has seen a notable volatility spike with prices failing to tackle its current record price of $111,800 reached during last month\u2019s rally.

Since, Bitcoin has managed to endure subsequent price drops, with the most recent plunging BTC toward the $98,000 zone. However, the cryptocurrency has managed to record a 2.4% recovery on the weekly time frame, currently consolidating at $107,000. Originally founded as an enterprise software firm, Strategy has transformed into a leveraged play on Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly owning it. Since August 2020, the company has consistently increased its Bitcoin reserves by selling stock and debt. This has prompted criticism from analysts who believe this could be dangerous if the Bitcoin price drops below the firm\u2019s average buying price.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-microstrategy-tom-lee-bets-eth-price/",
      "summary": "Nearly three years after the Merge formally switched Ethereum to proof-of-stake on 15 September 2022, a publicly listed Bitcoin miner is adopting the network\u2019s native token as its primary treasury asset. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) on 30 June priced a $250 million private placement of 55,555,556 new shares at $4.50 each and appointed Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as chairman. The company\u2019s SEC filing and press release make the purpose explicit: all net proceeds will be used to acquire and stake ether, a move management likens to Michael Saylor\u2019s now-legendary Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy. Tom Lee Goes Full MicroStrategy On Ethereum Speaking hours later on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Lee framed the pivot as a logical response to the explosive growth of stablecoins, most of which settle on Ethereum. \u201cStablecoins, which is the ChatGPT of crypto, because it\u2019s viral adoption by consumers, businesses, banks and now even Visa,\u201d he said, underscoring why a treasury heavy in ETH could become strategically indispensable. Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake design means that large holders who validate blocks \u201csecure the fidelity of stablecoins,\u201d Lee continued. \u201cWhen Goldman issues a stablecoin and JP Morgan [issues] it on Ethereum as a layer-one blockchain, they\u2019re going to want to secure it by staking Ethereum.\u201d Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs Lee tied the long-term upside to macro numbers the US Treasury itself has started to cite. Stablecoins today hover around $250 billion; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested the figure could hit $2 trillion\u2014a potential ten-fold expansion that, in Lee\u2019s words, would \u201cinsure dollar dominance.\u201d Because Ethereum already underpins more than half of stable-value tokens, a multi-trillion-dollar stablecoin market would translate directly into rising transaction fees for the network and, by extension, higher staking rewards for BitMine\u2019s planned validator clusters. The private-placement syndicate reads like a who\u2019s-who roster from both TradFi and crypto: MOZAYYX led the round, joined by Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group, Diametric Capital and Occam Crest. Closing is expected on or about 3 July, subject to NYSE American approval. BitMine, headquartered in Las Vegas, will immediately deploy the ETH position into staking, giving the miner a yield-bearing balance-sheet asset while reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s security budget. \u201cOne of the key performance metrics for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share,\u201d chief executive Jonathan Bates said in the statement. For investors, the comparison with MicroStrategy is unavoidable but imperfect. Saylor\u2019s company amassed bitcoin under a proof-of-work regime that offers no native yield; BitMine\u2019s ether can generate income through both staking rewards and potential capital-markets transactions collateralized by those staked coins. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation Yet both strategies share a central bet: that a scarce digital asset sitting at the core of global finance will appreciate faster than cash alternatives on a corporate balance sheet. Whether BitMine achieves MicroStrategy-level returns will depend on execution, regulatory clarity for staking, and\u2014most of all\u2014Ethereum\u2019s price path. What is clear, however, is that corporate treasuries are beginning to see ether not merely as \u201cgas\u201d for decentralized applications but as a strategic reserve asset in its own right. From a market-structure vantage, the new treasury model could translate into meaningful price torque for Ether if it scales. MicroStrategy\u2019s serial purchases have now absorbed nearly 600,000 BTC\u2014around 2.8 percent of the 21 million-coin cap\u2014and coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s ascent from roughly $11,000 in August 2020, when the company made its first buy, to more than $107,000 today, a near-ten-fold move. BitMine\u2019s opening salvo\u2014$250 million, or about 100,000 ETH at current prices\u2014represents barely 0.08 percent of Ethereum\u2019s 122 million-coin supply, yet roughly 28 percent of that supply is already locked in staking contracts while net issuance has turned negative post-EIP-1559, shrinking the freely tradable float. If even a handful of additional balance sheets emulate this \u201cETH-as-reserve\u201d playbook, the resulting demand shock could replicate the supply-squeeze dynamics that propelled Bitcoin into six-figure territory. At press time, Ether traded at $2,459. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
