      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/lagrange-crypto-la-surges-500-solaxy-next-5x-token/",
      "summary": "Thousands of tokens launch every day. Most crash quickly, becoming worthless in time (or all but worthless). So why do people keep investing? Because every now and then, a Lagrange ($LA) comes along. The utility token for the Lagrange Foundation, which aims to support a verifiable AI ecosystem, $LA climbed 560%+ in a few hours after securing listings across major exchanges. The move pushed the token\u2019s market cap over $287M. What went right for $LA, and what does it say about other upcoming projects? Stars Aligned for $LA Launch Lagrange had a few things going for it: Foundational ecosystem: $LA fuels the base layer for an ambitious but detailed technical project (the ZK Prover Network). Strong early interest: Lagrange attracted major early development from the likes of Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, which provided $13.2M in seed funding. Detailed project design: Tokenomics, fee generation, staking \u2013 Lagrange clearly defined how each element worked in the $LA ecosystem. Broad DEX/CEX listing: After the TGE (Token Generation Event), $LA went live on a number of major exchanges, including Coinbase, KuCoin, Bitget, and more. It was a combination of factors, rather than any one thing, that helped push the project up. Crucially, investors seem confident in the long-term outlook for the Lagrange Foundation. When some investors took profits off the initial surge, causing the token to dip, others bought the dip, pushing $LA back up. No two crypto projects are identical, and this goes for their future potential, as well. But we can take some of the basic principles from $LA\u2019s success and apply them to other projects to get a better idea of their chances. And one project \u2013 Solaxy ($SOLX) \u2013 shows promising similarities to $LA. Solaxy ($SOLX) \u2013 Meme-Focused Multichain Token for Groundbreaking Solana Layer-2 Solaxy ($SOLX) might seem like your average Solana meme coin, at least at first glance. But under the surface, Solaxy isn\u2019t just a meme coin \u2013 it\u2019s the foundation of the first ever Solana Layer-2, designed to be the foundation of a whole generation of faster-than-ever Solana tokens. It might even become one of the best meme coins in 2025 and beyond. A closer look at the project shows how $SOLX and $LA share some critical features: $LA raised $13.2M in seed funding; $SOLX raised $44.5M in its crypto presale (set to end in 10 days). $LA provided detailed information about technical developments; $SOLX has already launched the Solaxy block explorer and bridge, with full operational status in June 2025. $LA serves to support key ZK products and features; $SOLX offers a blazing-fast blockchain to add to the $56B meme coin market Both $LA and $SOLX are multi-chain tokens; $LA supports Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Solana, Optimism, and Polygon, and $SOLX supports Solana and Ethereum Solaxy is working fast, rolling out key features in the techmap to push full deployment of the Layer-2 as soon as possible. There\u2019s only ten days left for investors to get in during the presale. If $SOLX imitates $LA\u2019s climb, this is the lowest the price will ever be, so learn how to buy Solaxy with our guide, and don&#8217;t delay. The current token price is $0.001746. Our price prediction shows that it could climb to $0.032 by the end of the year, passing even $LA&#8217;s success and delivering 1,735% returns to investors who get in now. Visit the Solaxy presale page. Factors for $LA\u2019s Success Bode Well for $SOLX That 500% price increase was pretty sweet for early Lagrange investors, and who knows how far the $LA token will go? Some of the same factors that contributed to $LA\u2019s big wins look promising for $SOLX as well. Will it be the next 5x token? Never invest in anything without doing your own research; this is not financial advice."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rsi-dips-below-30-new-all-time-high-next/",
      "summary": "Data shows the 14-day Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped into the oversold region. Here&#8217;s what this could mean for the asset. Bitcoin RSI Has Breached Below The 30 Mark In a new post on X, analyst Axel Adler Jr has talked about the latest trend in the RSI of Bitcoin. The &#8220;RSI&#8221; refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that measures the speed and magnitude of changes occurring in any given asset&#8217;s price over a specific period. In the current case, the period is 14 days. This metric is generally used for spotting oversold or overbought conditions for the asset. When the RSI is greater than 70, it can be a sign that the price is heating up and may be due a correction to the downside. On the other hand, it being under 30 can imply the asset is becoming underbought. Related Reading: Solana\u2019s Old Hands Are Moving\u2014Is Trouble Brewing? Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 14-day Bitcoin RSI over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the 14-day Bitcoin RSI has plummeted recently and is now below the 30 threshold. This naturally suggests the cryptocurrency is becoming oversold, at least from the perspective of this indicator. &#8220;Other metrics are also showing alerts,&#8221; notes Adler Jr. &#8220;I think now all conditions are in place to start testing the ATH.&#8221; Though, while bullish developments may have occurred on the RSI and other indicators, BTC has actually declined during the past day. On-chain data may provide hints about where the next potential support zone could be located for the asset. As the analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in its latest weekly report, the average cost basis of the short-term holders is located at $97,100. The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins during the past 155 days. The cost basis of this group has often been a relevant level for the cryptocurrency, taking turns as support and resistance. In the chart, the analytics firm has also shown two other levels: the +1 and -1 standard deviation bands. Currently, the latter is situated at $83,200, so it&#8217;s possible that if BTC&#8217;s bearish momentum lasts for long enough to push it under the STH cost basis, this value could prove significant. However, before this level, there is another on-chain level that could be important. The level in question is part of the Spent Supply Distribution (SSD) Quantiles model, which basically tells us which price levels the investors selling their coins right now initially purchased them. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Key Investors Double Down, Buy Another 79,000 BTC The 0.85 quantile is located at $95,600, which is quite close to the STH cost basis, so a retest of the zone could be a particularly vital one for Bitcoin.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-surges-past-8-million-daily-transactions-as-trx-holds-above-0-27/",
      "summary": "TRON (TRX) has experienced relatively stable price movement over the past week, fluctuating within a narrow range between $0.276 and $0.272. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $0.2729, reflecting a weekly decline of approximately 1.5%. However, zooming out reveals a broader uptrend, with TRX gaining nearly 12% over the past month, indicating growing market interest amid a backdrop of increased on-chain activity. An assessment of TRON\u2019s network-level data suggests the blockchain is experiencing a surge in usage. According to a recent analysis published on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform by contributor Darkfost, daily transaction volume on the TRON network has crossed the 8 million mark, a notable increase from earlier this year. This growth in network transactions is considered a critical indicator of underlying demand and user engagement, which could influence market sentiment around the asset. Related Reading: TRON Activity Hits All-Time High, Is a TRX Price Breakout Coming? Transaction Volume and Address Activity Show Strong Network Engagement Darkfost noted that TRON\u2019s monthly average for daily transactions has seen consistent growth, with recent data showing a roughly 2 million increase in average daily transactions since February. The network is now processing over 8 million transactions per day, marking a more than 30% rise over the past four months. Importantly, a large share of these transactions is occurring outside centralized exchanges, pointing to the growing utility of the blockchain for peer-to-peer transfers and decentralized application (dApp) usage. This shift away from centralized platforms may reflect increased interest in TRON\u2019s native ecosystem services and its competitive yield offerings. As more users interact directly with the network, transaction-based liquidity grows, which can contribute to stronger economic activity across the TRON protocol. Darkfost emphasized that this trend of non-exchange transactions is a positive signal for the blockchain\u2019s real-world usage and investor adoption. TRON Active Address Metrics Reach New Highs In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Cryptoonchain highlighted that both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages for active addresses on the TRON network have hit their highest levels to date. This sustained rise in active wallet participation suggests a growing user base that is consistently interacting with the blockchain. While TRX\u2019s price has not fully kept pace with the uptick in address activity, historical trends suggest that increased user engagement often precedes upward price movement. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Reason Behind Tron Price Sluggishness \u2014 Are TRX Bears Now In Control?

People normally open new wallets to send and receive bitcoins but they somehow come across the idea through new sources, increased talks among friends or create simple curiosity.

This was deemed the busiest day since December 2024. Reports from Santiment suggest that high coin turnover usually coincides with increased traffic. Traders might be moving coins in and out of exchanges, or investors could be shifting wallets. Big swings in daily token movement can point to a shift in sentiment\u2014people either getting ready to buy or sell. Right now, it mostly looks like more users are sending coins to each other, which keeps the network busy even when price sits still. Big Holders Step In Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large holders\u2014often called \u201cwhales\u201d\u2014are stocking up. Their coin inflows jumped by 145% over the last seven days, and by 214% over the past 30 days. When big players load up, it can tighten supply on exchanges. That makes it tougher for new buyers to get in without driving price higher. If whales keep buying at this rate, it could lead to more upward pressure on price once everyday investors step in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Mid Tier Investors Buy It\u2019s not just the really big holders adding coins. Wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC added more than 79,000 BTC in just one week. That means these mid-tier holders picked up around 11,320 BTC per day on average. As of June 2, they held over 13 million BTC in total. When both big whales and these mid-level holders keep stacking, it further cuts down the number of coins floating on exchanges. Fewer coins available often mean any shift in demand could move price more. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"
