      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-prepping-for-takeoff/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin may be gearing up for its next breakout. After holding firm near $0.17 on the weekly chart, DOGE recently bounced off key Fibonacci and trendline support, hinting at renewed bullish potential. With its 200\u2011week moving average offering steady support and price comfortably above the ascending channel, technicals suggest the setup is aligning. If the recent dip toward the 200 MA on the M15 chart proves to be a low-risk entry, this could set the stage for a retest of the $0.16490 resistance, and possibly more. Rejection At Resistance, But Technicals Still Favor Bulls In a recent analysis shared on X, Thomas Anderson presented a detailed breakdown of DOGE/USD price action across the M15 and M30 timeframes. According to the expert, Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.17043, and the price is facing rejection at the yellow horizontal resistance line around $0.16490. The price action shows consolidation just below this key level, signaling indecision among traders. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline Anderson pointed out that the 200 MA (red line) is acting as dynamic support from below, helping to anchor the price during the current consolidation phase. This moving average support provides bulls the foundation to regain control if momentum shifts in their favor. On the M30 chart, Anderson noted that the broader bullish structure remains intact, with DOGE price holding above the ascending trendline. This technical pattern suggests continued optimism for upward movement, provided the price does not break below key support areas. Thomas Anderson concluded that any pullback toward the 200 MA on the M15 timeframe could offer a buying opportunity, particularly for traders eyeing a retest of the $0.16490 resistance. Dogecoin Weekly Chart Echoes Elliott Theory\u2019s Bullish Blueprint Taking a closer look at Dogecoin\u2019s weekly chart, crypto analyst Andrew observed a notable long-term wave structure unfolding. He explained that over the past three years, DOGE has completed a five-wave impulse to the upside, which was followed by a typical ABC correction, consistent with Elliott Wave theory. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes Breakout \u2014 Can Bulls Unleash the Next Surge? Andrew further noted that price found a strong reaction at the 0.786 Fibonacci level, marked by a light blue line, which traces the retracement from the entire upward move. This reaction suggests that DOGE may have reached a critical support area, where buyers could begin stepping in. With this in mind, Andrew believes the current structure appears to be forming a larger 1-2 setup, which could lead to a powerful Wave 3 advance. If this pattern plays out, it may signal the start of a new bullish phase with the potential to break beyond previous highs. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Ledger has announced a limited-time 30% discount on nearly all color models of its popular Nano S Plus and Nano X hardware wallets, valid through July 15. The promotion has drawn fresh attention to the company\u2019s flagship products, widely regarded as industry benchmarks for secure crypto storage. Together, the Nano S Plus and Nano X boast 13,345 reviews, the majority of which are positive, underscoring the strong trust and satisfaction among users worldwide. But what makes Ledger such a popular hardware wallet? Ledger Wallet\u2019s Blend of Security, Comfort, and Style \u2013 this is what makes them so attractive to its loyal fanbase and newbies alike. Ledger excels in the areas of security, comfort level, and overall style, but it\u2019s the wallet\u2019s security features that attract users. Ledger relies on a multi-layered security profile, with several noticeable features, like: \u2705 The PIN code that secures the actual device to prevent unauthorized access is required to complete any transaction \u2705 The 24-word phrase, which acts as the master key, secures your funds against any malicious access \u2705 The trademark Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System (BOLOS), which isolates any installed apps from one another and the 24-word phrase from all apps and the operating system itself \u2705 Secure Element Chip, the hardware component that keeps the private keys offline for a higher level of security Plus, Ledger\u2019s Donjon team, which consists of seasoned hackers, is constantly testing the products\u2019 security to identify any potential vulnerabilities. Their efforts are part of Ledger\u2019s Bug Bounty program, which rewards anyone who finds security weaknesses in Bitcoin, showcasing the team\u2019s commitment to continuous improvements in the security department. While security is the most important aspect, other features matter as well, like the comfort level associated with carrying and using the wallet. Ledger\u2019s Nano S Plus and Nano X are the sleekest and most comfortable to use and wear, thanks to their slim builds. Nano S Plus consists of steel and plastic, weighing only 0.74 ounces, while Nano X is slightly larger, thanks to the lithium battery, reaching 1.19 ounces. The slim format makes them comfortable to wear, even as keychains if you always insist on having them with you. Finally, the color palette offers a final touch to the already unique style, imbuing the wallets with a modern vibe. Colors like emerald-green, sapphire-blue, and amethyst-purple come with a plus of personality and X factor. The Massive 30% Discount Ends on July 15 Ledger\u2019s flash promotion (offering a 30% discount on its Nano S Plus and Nano X wallets) is set to end on July 15, giving buyers less than a week to take advantage. The deal aims to spotlight two of Ledger\u2019s most widely used products, with a combined user base of around 7 million worldwide. Most color options are eligible, with only onyx-black and BTC-orange for the Nano X, and matte-black and BTC-orange for the Nano S Plus excluded from the promotion. Should You Buy the Ledger Wallet? Nobody can answer that for you, but if you\u2019ve decided that the Ledger wallet meets your expectations in terms of security, style, and ease of use, and you want to buy it, buy it today. Or, at the very least, until July 15, when the current 30% promotion ends, because discounts like these don\u2019t come often. Also, go to Ledger\u2019s website and scroll through their offers. You\u2019ll find a lot of products and accessories, based on your needs. Remember, this is not financial advice. Do your own research before buying any product."

Market Reaction Follows Viral Meme Meme tokens often depend on hype, and PNUT was no exception. After Musk\u2019s message spread, order books filled fast. Buy orders outnumbered sells, driving price momentum. Crypto bots and retail traders piled in, hoping to catch the wave. Some investors told reporters they moved funds into PNUT within minutes of seeing Musk\u2019s post.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/50-moonshot-for-xrp-price/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Jaydee has predicted a 50% rally for the XRP price. He highlighted a resistance level, which the altcoin needs to break above on its BTC pair to record this massive uptrend. XRP Price Eyes 50% Rally With Break Above $2.20 In an X post, Jaydee predicted that the XRP price will record a 50% \u201cmoonshot\u201d rally once it breaks above the $0.00002 resistance level on its Bitcoin pair. XRP has since broken above this resistance level, suggesting that this moonshot rally may be imminent, with the altcoin surging to as high as $3.35. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 A rally to $3.35 will bring the XRP price close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. In a subsequent analysis, Jaydee confirmed that XRP could rally to new ATHs with a successful break above this resistance level. On the other hand, he warned that the altcoin could crash to as low as $1.60 if it fails to hold this level on at least the 3-day timeframe. Crypto analyst Guy also recently predicted that the XRP price could rally to a new ATH of $5.30. The analyst indicated that the $2.33 level is the key to kickstarting this uptrend for the altcoin. Once XRP breaks above, he predicts that it will rally to $2.55. A break above this $2.55 level would then pave the way for another rally to the current ATH and the Fibonacci extension at $5.30. Possible Scenarios Following Break Above $2.30 In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined three potential scenarios that could unfold following the XRP price break above $2.30. The first scenario is the cleanest move, in which she predicts that XRP could run towards $2.45, then flips $2.30 into support on a backtest. CasiTrades remarked that this gives the altcoin a solid base for a move to $2.69 and beyond. Related Reading: Will XRP Dethrone Ethereum To Lead This Altcoin Season? For the second scenario, the crypto analyst described this as a more aggressive move. In this case, she predicts that the XRP price could record a sharp breakout through $2.30 and head straight to $2.69. From there, she added that the altcoin could pull back to $2.45 as the mid-way support zone before continuing its uptrend. The third scenario is the most bullish for the XRP price. CasiTrades predicts that the altcoin could break through $2.69, confirm this price level as support, and then clear the way towards $3 and above. This would then put the current ATH in sight for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.32, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-action-signals-momentum-shift-btc-sleeps-and-eth-moves/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has finally pushed above the critical $2,600 level after weeks of range-bound trading, marking a potential turning point in its price structure. This breakout comes as bullish momentum builds, with Ethereum now preparing for a possible expansion toward the $2,800 resistance level\u2014a zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts since early May. The coming days will be decisive in shaping Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory, especially if bulls manage to drive the price beyond this key barrier. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise A breakout above $2,800 would not only signal renewed strength in Ethereum but could also catalyze a broader altcoin rally. Market sentiment is gradually shifting, with traders growing more optimistic amid easing macroeconomic pressures and signs of renewed risk appetite. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared an Ethereum chart showing a clear upward breakout from compression. This technical pattern typically precedes strong directional moves, and in this case, it favors the bulls. Pillows suggests that Ethereum is taking the lead while Bitcoin remains in consolidation, indicating that ETH may be setting the pace for the next phase of the crypto cycle. All eyes are now on the $2,800 level, which could unlock significant upside if breached. Ethereum Leads the Charge: Major Move Ahead Since early May, Ethereum has traded within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, unable to break out despite several attempts. This extended period of sideways action has built up pressure, and market participants widely expect the next move to be significant. Bulls have shown resilience, defending demand levels and keeping ETH above the $2,500 mark for several weeks. However, a clear breakout above critical resistance is still needed to confirm a broader bullish trend. Altcoins continue to struggle, with most still trading below key resistance levels. Many analysts agree that a sustained Ethereum breakout is the missing trigger for the long-awaited altseason. Market leadership from ETH has historically marked the start of major altcoin rallies, and the current setup could be no different. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a 4-hour chart highlighting an upward breakout from a compression pattern just above $2,600. According to Pillow\u2019s analysis, Ethereum is leading the market while Bitcoin remains in a holding pattern below all-time highs. This leadership role for ETH could signal a shift in capital toward altcoins, especially if Ethereum follows through and breaks the $2,800 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support \u2013 Momentum Builds For Range Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Upward Momentum Builds Above $2,600 Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after breaking above the key $2,600 level. The 12-hour chart reveals a bullish structure forming, with ETH currently trading at $2,612.61. This move follows a sustained period of consolidation between $2,400 and $2,600, where buyers consistently defended lower levels. Now, Ethereum is printing higher lows and gradually reclaiming its moving averages. Price is now trading above the 50-period and 100-period simple moving averages (SMAs), currently positioned at $2,483.37 and $2,536.77, respectively. This alignment is bullish and suggests ETH is building momentum for a potential retest of the $2,700\u2013$2,800 resistance zone. A successful break above this area would confirm the breakout from compression and open the door for a more significant rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens \u2013 Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Volume remains moderate, but recent green candles show growing buyer interest as ETH pushes upward.
