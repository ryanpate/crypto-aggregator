      "summary": "Ethereum is trading at a critical level as tensions in the Middle East escalate following fresh conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite the rising global uncertainty, ETH continues to show resilience, holding firmly above the $2,500 support zone. Bulls remain in control for now, but selling pressure is building as bears attempt to push the price below the current range. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with investors closely watching for any sign of breakdown or breakout. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts \u2013 Can Demand Hold? Top analyst Rekt Capital recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Ethereum\u2019s ability to maintain $2,500 as a support level despite the recent dip. Historically, this price level has acted as a strong foundation for rallies to $4,000, including significant moves in August 2021 and early 2024. If ETH can continue defending this zone, it may signal that bulls are ready to build momentum toward a new leg up, possibly triggering broader altcoin strength. However, with rising geopolitical risks and increased volatility across risk assets, Ethereum faces a true test of strength. If this level holds, it may mark the start of Ethereum\u2019s next significant move. Will history repeat itself, or are further corrections ahead? Ethereum Faces Pressure But Holds Critical Support Zone Ethereum has dropped over 14% since Wednesday, sparking widespread fear and uncertainty among traders and long-term holders alike. Just days ago, sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish, with many investors expecting ETH to break above the $3,000 level and confirm a broader altcoin rally. However, geopolitical instability has disrupted market momentum. On Thursday, news of Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran and subsequent retaliations sent shockwaves across global markets, triggering a sharp risk-off reaction and a spike in volatility across crypto assets. Despite the intense selling pressure, Ethereum is showing resilience. Rekt Capital shared a technical breakdown pointing out that ETH continues to hold the $2,500 level as key support. This isn\u2019t the first time ETH has used $2,500 as a launchpad\u2014historical patterns from August 2021 and early 2024 show that maintaining this level has led to rallies toward $4,000. According to Rekt, Ethereum must continue demonstrating stability around this zone to avoid a deeper retrace and keep bullish momentum alive. For the past five weeks, ETH has successfully defended the $2,500 region, forming a solid base of support despite repeated tests. Whether Ethereum can hold this ground once again will likely define the direction for altcoins and set the tone for the broader crypto market in the weeks ahead.

Despite the recent volatility driven by geopolitical tensions, Ethereum has managed to hold above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are currently sloping upward \u2014 a positive sign for momentum. The red 200-day moving average, located around $2,642, has acted as a firm resistance barrier. ETH briefly broke above this level but failed to close above it with strength, leading to a retracement.

Grumbach (@JakeMGrumbach) June 14, 2025 Institutional Backers Rally Jane Street leads the pack with a $375 million stake in the Trump Group. That makes it the largest backer so far. Other investors are also lining up. Based on reports, TMTG\u2019s goal is to raise $2.5 billion and use much of that cash to buy Bitcoin. If all goes to plan, the firm could hold over 140,000 BTC at current prices. Regulatory Milestone Achieved On Friday, June 13, the SEC declared TMTG\u2019s registration statement for its Bitcoin Treasury offering effective. That covers 56 million new shares of equity and 29 million in convertible notes. Clearing this step means the company can sell shares and raise the cash it needs. It also subjects TMTG to ongoing SEC reporting and oversight. Voice Of The Crypto Industry Meanwhile, a DRW spokesperson called for a fresh look at the SEC and CFTC. The firm argued that the current regulators don\u2019t match the pace of global market changes. Over the years, DRW\u2019s crypto arm, Cumberland, bought 70,000 BTC in a US government auction of Silk Road assets. That stash is worth about $7.7 billion today.

Related Reading: ONDO To Repeat 2024\u2019s \u2018Parabolic\u2019 Run? Analyst Anticipates 130% Rally Soon Bitcoin to Continue Choppy Performance On Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin dropped 5.5% to the $102,000 support fueled by the news of the Iran-Israel conflict. Amid the market pullback, the flagship crypto failed to hold its $108,000-$110,000 three-day range, falling to the mid-zone of its post-November breakout range. Notably, BTC had just recovered from last week\u2019s retest of the $100,000 level, reclaiming the key $106,800 area as support earlier this week. Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency \u201csaw a clear trigger on that retest of the range high,\u201d driven by the headlines of the Middle East turmoil, as it is \u201cstill quite a volatile and headline-driven market currently.\u201d Bitcoin took the liquidity above and below its local price range, the analyst explained, adding that it is \u201calready starting to trade more like the choppy (pre) summer environment\u201d he had forecasted. Despite the drop, the analyst highlighted that the range high remains the key level for a larger move up: I think the range high is a key area for the Bulls to hold on to. If not, I think there&#8217;s a case to be made for a local high to be put in and for the market to move back further within this range. At this point, I&#8217;m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possibly beyond). However, he suggested investors be cautious until BTC price breaks back above the range high convincingly and holds it as support on the higher timeframes. \u201cDon&#8217;t chop yourself up in the next few weeks/months,\u201d he warned. Volatility Could Send BTC To Range Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted a potential double top pattern forming on BTC\u2019s 4H chart, noting that if the price didn\u2019t bounce from the previous descending resistance, reclaimed a week ago, it could further drop into the mid-zone of its range. According to the analysis, if it loses the mid-range, BTC could risk a retest of the range lows, around the $90,000-$92,000 area. Similarly, market watcher Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin could fill the lower CME gaps if the war narrative intensifies. BTC opened two CME gaps between the end of April and the start of May, situated at the $92,500 and $97,300 levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the trader considers that this could serve as a discount entry for investors, as BTC \u201calready left higher CME gaps open,\u201d signaling that a rebound to the levels is likely. Moreover, he noted that Bitcoin is displaying the same structure as last year, which could hint at a massive rally brewing. In 2024, the cryptocurrency faced rejection from a multi-month descending resistance following its all-time high (ATH) rally, which set the Range high level.

      "summary": "Data shows the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen weekly inflows five times the recent average, while Bitcoin has seen a slowdown in momentum. Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Seen 154,000 ETH In Inflows This Week In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow related to the US-based Ethereum spot ETFs. The &#8220;spot ETFs&#8221; refer to investment vehicles that allow an alternate means of exposure to a given asset. This means that with a spot ETF, a trader can &#8216;invest&#8217; into an asset without having to directly own it. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this is especially relevant, as the ETFs trade on traditional platforms. Some investors may not want to fiddle with digital asset exchanges and wallets, so the ETFs offer them a familiar path into cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals The option of the spot ETFs is a relatively recent one in the sector, with Bitcoin&#8217;s version gaining approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and Ethereum&#8217;s in mid-2024. Below is a chart that shows how the netflows related to the latter&#8217;s spot ETFs have looked during the past month. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Ethereum US spot ETFs have been witnessing net inflows for the last few weeks, a sign that there has been demand for the coin from the traditional investors. &#8220;This week alone, they\u2019ve seen 154K ETH in inflows &#8211; 5x higher than their recent weekly average,&#8221; notes Glassnode. &#8220;For context: the biggest single-day ETH inflow this month was 77K ETH on June 11th.&#8221; While the trend has been that of growth for Ethereum, it has looked a bit more mixed when it comes to the number one digital asset, Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin US spot ETFs have also seen positive netflows this week. The scale of the inflows, however, hasn&#8217;t been anything impressive, as only around 7,800 BTC has entered into the ETFs. This is above average, but far lower than the highs witnessed in May, when at one point the daily inflow had reached a peak of 7,900 BTC, more than the inflows for the entire current week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet\u2014But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos Last week, the Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed an outright negative netflow, so it seems the momentum has recently just been slower for the asset. In contrast, things have looked much more green for Ethereum indeed.
