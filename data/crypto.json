      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-approaches-wyckoff-liftoff-phase-can-eth-reach-a-new-high/",
      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) is up 4.2% over the past seven days, trading in the mid-$2,500 range at the time of writing. Although the digital asset remains down 19% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, some analysts are optimistic that it\u2019s ready for a liftoff. Ethereum Enters Wyckoff \u2018Liftoff\u2019 Phase In an X post published today, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum appears to be following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern and has successfully cleared both the \u2018creek\u2019 and \u2018spring\u2019 phases, potentially entering the \u2018liftoff\u2019 phase characterized by parabolic price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge In the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, the \u2018creek\u2019 represents overhead resistance where price struggles to break higher, while the \u2018spring\u2019 is a false breakdown below support, meant to trap bears and confirm strong hands. The \u2018liftoff\u2019 phase follows the spring, marked by a sharp recovery and breakout above resistance, signaling the start of a new bullish trend. The analyst shared the following Ethereum daily chart, which shows the cryptocurrency on the verge of a potential breakout, with its next major resistance at the $3,700 level. A successful breakout and retest of this level could set the stage for a new all-time high (ATH). Fellow crypto analyst Crypto GEMs also pointed toward Ethereum getting ready for a significant move to the upside. The analyst shared the following chart which compares ETH\u2019s price action in 2025 to that in 2024. If Ethereum mirrors its 2024 performance, it could break above the $3,000 mark in the near term. However, not all analysts share this bullish outlook. For instance, noted crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a four-hour Ethereum chart showing the asset trading within a rising wedge pattern. He cautioned that unless ETH breaks out of this formation, it may face a drop to $2,200. To explain, a rising wedge pattern is a bearish chart formation where price moves upward within converging trendlines, indicating weakening bullish momentum. It often signals an upcoming breakdown, as buyers lose control and sellers push the price lower after the wedge is breached. ETH Network Sees Renewed Activity In a separate X post, crypto analyst CryptoGoos remarked that daily transactions on Ethereum are nearing ATH level for the first time since 2021. Typically, heightened network activity tends to precede major price movements. Analyst Crypto Rover echoed this view, noting that active addresses across the Ethereum network have hit a new all-time high. They added that ETH below $3,000 is &#8220;an absolute steal.&#8221; Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross On Daily Chart \u2013 Is A New ATH Within Reach?

      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s price action caught traders\u2019 attention this week. After dipping toward the $0.13\u2013$0.15 demand zone, the meme\u2011coin shot higher, and a surge in derivatives data suggests many expect more gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming Trader Interest Climbs Around $0.19 Resistance According to market data, Open Interest jumped by 16% to reach over $2 billion. Options volume exploded by 400%. That kind of rise often points to big bets on upward swings. Right now, many eyes are on the $0.20 resistance level. If DOGE can close a daily candle above that line, it may clear the way toward $0.27. Dogecoin\u2019s technical setup is drawing fresh looks from chart watchers. The Stochastic RSI crossed above 80, which can mark an overbought zone. Yet coins have stayed above overbought readings before when buyers kept pushing. Traders will want to see real volume behind any move above that descending trendline near $0.19. Without it, the rally may stall or give back gains. Whales Return With Spot Inflows Based on reports, Dogecoin saw a net inflow of $8.20 million into spot wallets. That marks a big shift after weeks of outflows. Large holders have been moving coins onto exchanges in the past, but now they\u2019re pulling more in. In other cycles, fresh whale buys have lined up with mid\u2011term rallies. On\u2011chain metrics add another layer. Dogecoin\u2019s MVRV Z\u2011score climbed back to 0.355 after hitting near\u2011historical lows late in June. That figure measures how much profit holders stand to make on average. A rising score hints that fewer holders are underwater, and that might draw in new buyers. Still, MVRV is backward\u2011looking. It can\u2019t predict if price will break through key resistance. Network Activity Shows Mixed Signals Network stats tell a mixed story. Daily active addresses slid to 34 K, and transaction counts dropped to 15K as of July 3. That\u2019s a sharp fall from the more than 500K addresses and transactions seen in the last week of June. Lower usage could sap the rally\u2019s legs if retail traders don\u2019t reengage soon. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Even with these mixed signals, the mood toward Dogecoin is brighter than it was a week ago.

      "summary": "Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $13.36, following a 3% drop in the past 24 hours, which places the altcoin approximately 74% below its all-time high of $52.70, recorded in May. Despite this short-term dip, LINK has held onto weekly gains of around 2.4%, suggesting broader market participants may still be weighing its long-term potential. While price remains rangebound, recent on-chain data indicates that LINK\u2019s price action could be the result of diverging behavior between retail and institutional investors. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move Holds The Key Chainlink Institutional Accumulation and Supply Pressure CryptoQuant contributor \u201cBanker\u201d highlighted a growing structural dynamic in the LINK ecosystem in a recent QuickTake analysis titled \u201cLINK\u2019s Accumulation Standoff: Whales Build, Retail Waits.\u201d The report outlines how LINK is currently in a consolidation phase between $12 and $15, where institutional actors have been steadily accumulating tokens, while retail users remain largely passive. This discrepancy may be playing a key role in capping upward momentum despite persistent LINK outflows from centralized exchanges. According to Banker, exchange netflows for LINK have remained negative at roughly -100,000 LINK per week, signaling that more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This behavior is typically associated with accumulation activity, particularly from larger holders or \u201cwhales\u201d who may be positioning for longer-term appreciation. Historical spikes in retail deposits, such as the +5 million LINK deposited in March 2025, have proven to be exceptions rather than the norm, as retail activity has since remained subdued. Supporting this view, active LINK addresses have hovered consistently between 28,000 and 32,000 per day, while transaction counts average around 9,000 daily. These figures have not rebounded from previous activity peaks seen in late 2024, even as Chainlink\u2019s oracle usage has expanded. Meanwhile, elevated levels of exchange withdrawals, peaking at over 3,000 per day in Q4 2024, remain a dominant force. With leverage metrics staying neutral, whales have been able to withdraw LINK without introducing significant price volatility, resulting in a 40% year-to-date drop in exchange reserves. Market Outlook Hinges on Retail Reentry or Whale Fatigue As LINK\u2019s consolidation persists, the path forward may depend on a shift in market dynamics. Banker points out that a meaningful breakout will likely require renewed participation from retail traders, as evidenced by a spike in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals \u2018Opportunity\u2019 If these metrics rise and price breaks above the $15 price mark, momentum could build for a stronger upward trend. On the other hand, a decline in whale-driven withdrawals or an increase in exchange inflows could weaken accumulation, potentially pushing LINK back down toward the $10 level. Banker added: Until catalysts emerge, whales silently build positions, echoing Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 consolidation before its 2024 surge. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

You\u2019ll hear claims that XRP is already reshaping global finance and leaving old systems in the dust. According to influencer Coach JV, Ripple is building a whole new rails for money. He says XRP isn\u2019t here to compete with banks. It\u2019s here to replace them. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming He points out that transactions on the XRP Ledger settle in 3\u20135 seconds and cost fractions of a penny. That beats SWIFT transfers, which can take days and cost up to $50 per payment. XRP still trades around $2,25 but that figure, he argues, won\u2019t stay low for long if the token keeps winning regulatory approvals and new partners. XRP is the most disruptive financial technology of our lifetime. Ripple isn\u2019t just competing with the banking system, it\u2019s replacing it. The old system is dead. The new financial rails are being laid right before your eyes. Stay asleep and you\u2019ll miss the greatest wealth transfer\u2026 \u2014 Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) July 2, 2025 Ripple\u2019s Technology Versus Legacy Rails Based on reports, RippleNet now counts more than 300 financial institutions in its network. Yet daily on\u2011chain volumes for XRP hover around $1 billion\u2014small next to global cross\u2011border flows of roughly $150 billion per day. Banks are testing the tech, but most haven\u2019t shifted large sums yet. That gap between tests and real\u2011world use is one reason XRP\u2019s price has stayed below its all\u2011time high for seven years. Push For Regulatory Clarity XRP backers are watching the US carefully. They see growing buzz around spot XRP ETFs. Analysts like Eric Balchunas have given those filings up to 95% odds of approval by year\u2011end. If an ETF hits a US exchange, they say, more money will pour in. Ripple has also been chasing money\u2011transmitter licenses in Europe and Asia. Every new license, they believe, brings Ripple a step closer to mainstream use. Community Calls For Patience Coach JV keeps telling followers not to panic over a stagnant price. He uses phrases like \u201cgreatest wealth transfer in history\u201d to drive home his point. In an earlier tweet, he promised \u201cunimaginable wealth\u201d for anyone who holds on. Other voices, such as commentator Edoardo Farina, point out that only about 1 to 2 million people hold XRP today. That number, they say, leaves room for 100 million or more newcomers\u2014and more buyers often means higher prices. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Analysts Caution Over Hype Even so, some experts urge caution.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-targets-3000/",
      "summary": "The Ethereum price is flashing major upside signals as on-chain and market activity align toward a potential breakout to the $3,000 level. With crypto exchange balances falling to their lowest in nine years, stablecoin rails hitting record highs, and Spot Ethereum ETF inflows spiking last month, analysts now describe ETH as a \u201cpowder keg\u201d primed for explosive movement. Ethereum Price Eyes A $3,300 Breakout The Ethereum price action is drawing attention as it continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation range, hovering near $2,555 at the time of writing. Based on a recently released technical analysis by crypto analyst Pentoshi on X social media, ETH could be on the verge of a significant move, with $3,300 marked as the next bullish target in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here\u2019s Why The crypto expert\u2019s chart reveals that since early May 2025, Ethereum has been locked between two key levels\u2014a support zone around $2,190 and resistance near $2,750. This range has remained intact for over eight weeks, signaling a period of accumulation and low volatility after the sharp decline experienced in the first quarter of the year. Pentoshi has pinpointed $2,100 as the key downside risk in his bullish outlook, aligning closely with the lower support zone marked on the chart. While the next bullish extension and major resistance level has been identified as $3,300, the analyst expects Ethereum to make a move toward this price level within the next three months. He suggests that the current setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, estimating a potential upside of roughly 3.2x compared to the downside risk. Analyst Calls Ethereum A \u201cPowder Keg\u201d In other news, Eric Conner refers to Ethereum as a \u201cpowder keg,\u201d highlighting a growing convergence of fundamental factors that are building up pressure and positioning the cryptocurrency for a potentially parabolic move in the market. Related Reading: The Ethereum Waiting Game: Breakout To $2,800 Or Crash To $2,000? The analyst reports that Stablecoin activity on Ethereum has reached historic highs, with the total market capitalization of on-chain dollar-denominated assets hitting $251 billion\u2014a record that also marks 21 consecutive months of uninterrupted growth. In parallel, Ethereum Spot ETFs have brought in $1.17 billion in net inflows during June alone, marking a major shift in investors&#8217; appetite for ETH exposure. Even more notable, the amount of Ethereum available for trading is now at its lowest level in nearly a decade, with only nine million ETH tokens on centralized crypto exchanges. This nine-year low in exchange balances signals a drying float, where any fresh demand has an outsized impact on price. Conner has stated that large-scale crypto investors are beginning to take note. He reports that wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have accumulated more than 800,000 tokens daily during the peak week in June, marking the most aggressive absorption by whales since 2017. Currently, price action mirrors tension, and the analyst warns that if Ethereum decisively clears the $2,600 resistance level, the combination of supply scarcity, ETF-driven demand, and explosive stablecoin usage could unleash a violent and rapid breakout.
