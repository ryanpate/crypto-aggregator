      "summary": "Ethereum has shown signs of regaining momentum after a recent period of decline. The asset is currently trading at approximately $2,540, reflecting a modest 1% daily increase. This upward move follows a notable dip to the $2,400 range last week, marking what appears to be a short-term rebound from recent bearish pressure. While price fluctuations continue, on-chain analysts closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s market structure through various metrics that provide historical context and potential forecasting value. Recent insights from a CryptoQuant analyst have focused on how ETH\u2019s long-term behavior aligns with certain key indicators, which may help define price floors and signal overheated market conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages \u2013 Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Assessing Ethereum Price Floors Using On-Chain Data One of CryptoQuant\u2019s analysts, writing under the name CryptoOnchain, shared a breakdown of Ethereum\u2019s potential \u201cprice floors\u201d using a composite of on-chain and market metrics. These floors represent statistical thresholds that have historically acted as support zones during market corrections. Among them is the realized price, which measures the average value at which all circulating ETH last moved on-chain. This metric is often used as a sentiment gauge to track when market participants are in profit or loss. Another benchmark, the mean_price_classic, reflects the average daily closing price of ETH since inception and serves as a cumulative market average. It is used in conjunction with the delta_price_classic, a figure derived from the difference between Ethereum\u2019s realized capitalization and its historical average cap, adjusted for supply. According to the analyst, this delta price is frequently cited in Bitcoin analytics to highlight undervalued zones, and its adaptation for Ethereum provides a comparable lens for identifying periods when the market may be at or near a floor. Tracking Market Tops and Potential Resistance Zones In a separate analysis report, CryptoOnchain highlighted tools for identifying potential market tops. The indicators outlined include the realized_price_x2 and realized_price_x3, which are calculated by multiplying Ethereum\u2019s realized price by two and three, respectively. Historically, these levels have coincided with overheated phases of the market, where prices reached temporary peaks before correcting. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 \u2013 Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Another tool, the price_top_stddev, incorporates volatility into the analysis by adding two times the historical standard deviation of ETH\u2019s closing price to the realized price. This combination serves as a marker of statistically elevated prices, often aligning with periods of heightened euphoria and speculative activity. CryptoOnchain suggests that monitoring these zones can assist traders in managing risk during extended rallies, as these resistance levels have previously preceded major cycle reversals.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-on-chain-warning-short-term-holder-selling-accelerates-amid-price-correction/",
      "summary": "As Bitcoin (BTC) came close to slumping below the psychologically important $100,000 mark last week, the short-term holders (STH) cohort started to show signs of weakening conviction in the leading cryptocurrency, raising fears of a deeper price correction. Bitcoin STH Fear Resurfaces According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin STH\u2019s net position has turned sharply negative over the past month. This has happened despite BTC holding above the $100,000 level. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin STH are investors who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. They are generally more reactive to price volatility and market sentiment, often selling during corrections or uncertainty. Specifically, a cumulative net position change of -833,000 BTC has been recorded among short-term holders during the ongoing pullback. By comparison, the April crash saw a net position change of around -977,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Strength As Long-Term Holder Realized Cap Surges Past $20 Billion \u2013 Details Darkfost noted that current STH behavior closely resembles the activity observed during BTC\u2019s brief drop below $80,000 in April 2025, when the digital asset bottomed out at $74,508. The analyst wrote: Since then, STH appear to have become much more sensitive to market movements, and the recent dip around the $100,000 mark was enough to trigger renewed fear among this group of investors. BTC Showing Signs of Reversal Although BTC lost momentum after reaching its latest all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, the leading cryptocurrency regained strength over the weekend &#8211; indicating a possible reversal may be underway. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift For example, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that BTC has broken through the key resistance level at $106,600. In a recent X post, Martinez predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $108,300 or even $110,000 if current momentum continues. In a separate X post, fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital shared the following Bitcoin daily chart, noting that the cryptocurrency not only broke out of its two-week downtrend &#8211; highlighted in light blue &#8211; but may now be turning that former resistance into a new support level. Meanwhile, several technical indicators also point to continued bullish momentum. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Ribbons have recently flashed a prime buying signal. Additionally, on-chain data suggests that BTC could experience a sharp upward move in the short term, potentially driven by a negative funding rate on Binance. A prolonged period of negative funding rates often sets the stage for a short squeeze. Despite the bullish outlook, some red flags remain. Recent data shows that long-term holders are gradually exiting the market, while an influx of retail investors could add volatility to the current rally. At press time, BTC trades at $107,627, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant, X, and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/on-chain-data-flashes-bullish-is-bitcoin-ready-for-a-110k-comeback/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has resumed its upward trajectory, registering a modest 1.6% gain over the last 24 hours to trade at $107,428. The recovery comes after last week\u2019s dip toward $100,000 levels, which had been triggered by market-wide volatility and profit-taking. While BTC remains approximately 4.2% below its all-time high of $111,000 reached last month, the weekly trend still reflects a 3.3% increase, suggesting buyers are gradually regaining confidence. This market behavior is mirrored in a set of on-chain indicators recently analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages \u2013 Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Reflect Accumulation Behavior In Taha&#8217;s analysis titled \u201cOn-Chain Data Hints at Bitcoin\u2019s Next Leg Higher,\u201d Taha examined several metrics that point to a potential continuation of the rally. These include the Binance Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, UTXO age bands, and the Long-Term Holder (LTH) realized cap. All three suggest that market participants are actively accumulating and that underlying sentiment is shifting toward renewed bullishness. One of the primary indicators Taha focused on is Binance\u2019s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which has recently climbed to 1.1. This metric evaluates the volume of aggressive market buys versus market sells on the Binance exchange. A ratio above 1 typically implies that more participants are willing to pay the market price to buy than to sell, indicating stronger buyer conviction. According to Taha, such shifts historically precede continued price increases when supported by volume. Another key metric showing strength is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta over the last 90 days. This indicator tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure and is now halfway to its historical peak at 0.02. Taha explains that this suggests a market not yet overheated, with room for further accumulation. Combined with recent breakout behavior above the 1D\u20131W UTXO band, representing recently transacted coins, this hints that many new holders are currently in profit and choosing to hold rather than sell. LTH Conviction and Stablecoin Inflows Reinforce Bullish Case Taha also noted the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Cap has now surpassed $56 billion, reflecting strong hands holding a larger share of Bitcoin supply. These coins have not moved in over 155 days and are considered to represent investors with higher conviction. The increase in this metric implies that fewer coins are being sold into the market, a signal that many investors are expecting higher valuations in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leveraged Traders Are Back Betting On A Price Decline \u2014 What This Means In addition, more than $550 million in stablecoins have reportedly flowed into Binance in recent hours. Historically, such inflows to spot exchanges, as opposed to derivatives platforms, often suggest readiness to deploy capital for direct asset purchases. Notably, all of these indicators can be seen as a leading signal of potential volatility or buying pressure. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin\u2019s short-term price activity may benefit from continued accumulation and institutional positioning. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"
