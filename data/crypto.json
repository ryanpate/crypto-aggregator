      "summary": "The US Bitcoin spot ETFs logged over $2 billion in net inflows last week, marking a three-week streak of positive momentum. Despite a bearish start to June, with $128.81 million in net outflows during the first trading week, investor appetite soon quickly rebounded. This turnaround has resulted in a cumulative $4.63 billion in deposits over the past three weeks. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin\u2019s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength Bitcoin ETFs On Impressive 14-Day Positive Streak Despite Market Uncertainty On Friday June 27, the 12 US Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows of $501.27 million bringing the aggregate deposits of the last week to a staggering $2.22 billion. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the clean streak of daily inflows from last week extends the ETFs\u2019 positive performance to 14 consecutive days. In analyzing individual ETF data from this week, the BlackRock IBIT registered $1.31 billion in net deposits solidifying its position as the market\u2019s unrivalled leader. Meanwhile, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and Ark/21 Shares\u2019 ARKB also experienced substantial cumulative inflows of $504.40 million and $268.14 million, respectively. Grayscale\u2019s BTC, VanEck\u2019s HODL, Valkyrie\u2019s BRRR, Invesco\u2019s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton\u2019s EZBC also recorded moderate net flows ranging from $1million &#8211; $25 million. In familiar fashion, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC produced the only net outflows losing $5.69 million in withdrawals, but still retains its position as the third largest Bitcoin ETF with $19.79 billion in net assets. Following this week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now recorded $4.50 billion in net flows in June signaling a resolute demand from institutional investors despite Bitcoin market troubles. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed extensive corrections since hitting a new all-time high of $111,790 on May 22. Over the last month, BTC has made no new price discovery trading largely between $100,000 and $110,000 to form a descending price channel. While this price performance reflects a neutral market sentiment, the high influx of capital into the Bitcoin ETFs signal a long-term confidence by institutional investors on Bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation prospects.

In June alone, these ETFs saw total inflows of $1.13 billion, marking their largest monthly gain in 2025. As of the time of writing, the total net assets of the Ethereum ETFs stand at $9.88 billion, accounting for 3.37% of Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization.

Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has remained in the $106,000 &#8211; $107,000 range showing no indications of a breakout in either market direction. Amidst this market consolidation, renowned crypto analyst with X username KillaXBT has highlighted the key liquidation zones in the present Bitcoin market structure that are critical to the next significant price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Bitcoin: Clustering At $103K\u2013$106K And $108K\u2013$111K &#8211; What Could This Mean? In a recent X post , KillaXBT shares that Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal decision zone as liquidation heatmap data from Coinglass reveals notable liquidity clusters forming on both ends of the current price range. The market expert explains that BTC is trapped between long and short liquidation zones in both low and high time frames (L/HTF) signaling a moment of market indecision On the 7-day chart (LTF), KillaXBT states there are accumulations of long positions between $103,400 and $106,000. This data suggests that a move below this price range could trigger cascading stop-losses and force liquidations, sending Bitcoin prices lower in a short-term decline. On the other hand, there are also liquidity clusters in the $108,000\u2013$109,000 region, indicating the presence of potentially significant short positions. A breakout above $109,000 could initiate a sharp short squeeze, perhaps driving prices higher toward the current all-time high in the $111,000 price range. Using the 30-day chart (HTF), KillaXBT provides more information on the Bitcoin market stalemate. The analyst notes that more short-side liquidations are clustered between $108,300 and $109,000 than long-side liquidations between $103,000 and $106,000. However, the presence of short positions at $111,000 presents a scenario where bulls could reclaim control if they successfully push past this upper resistance. Ultimately, KillaXBT concludes the current BTC market structure suggests a delicate balance with high-leverage positions stacked both above and below current prices. The market expert warns that traders refrain from engaging the market until the highlighted liquidation zones are tested.

Meanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Sentora reports that Bitcoin&#8217;s weekly network fees totaled $3.39 million, marking a 38.9% decline from the previous week. Despite this drop in on-chain activity, exchange outflows of $310 million suggest a strong market confidence, as investors increasingly move their assets into private wallets, typically a sign of long-term holding intent.

Now, that bold forecast has resurfaced on social platform X, sparking fresh talk about where this digital token might head next. \u201cThe Chad Steingraber Theory\u201d \u2013 The Road to a $20K #XRP A Thread\ud83e\uddf5from The Future&#8230; I\u2019m going to tell you a story and I\u2019ll spin it so that all you need is an interest to learn what\u2019s in store for all of us. Grab a drink, grab a snack and let\u2019s take a ride, shall we? \u2014 Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) August 18, 2022 Rise Of Tokenized Assets According to Steingraber, the first step involves issuing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies on the XRP Ledger. Every time a new token launches there, it would need XRP to settle transactions. That could push up daily demand. Today, only a handful of tokens sit on the XRP chain, but he sees that growing into the hundreds. If even 100 new coins adopt XRP settlements, demand could climb by billions of dollars each year. It consists of three components: 1 &#8211; Assets built on the XRP Ledger (Stablecoins are the \u201cutility\u201d) 2 &#8211; XRP becomes a reserve asset to power the utility 3 &#8211; XRP is removed from public supply by institutions This is how IT WILL. \ud83d\ude09 https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc \u2014 Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 28, 2025 Banks Holding XRP As Gold Based on reports, the second driver is banks treating XRP like a reserve asset. Instead of just trading it on public exchanges, financial firms would stash XRP in private ledgers to back their own digital currencies. He points to \u201cmany institutions\u201d that have already floated plans to include XRP in their reserve piles. If each of those firms holds hundreds of millions of dollars in XRP, it could remove a large chunk of supply from open markets. Institutional Absorption Of Supply Here\u2019s where the math gets eye\u2011popping. XRP\u2019s total supply is capped at 100 billion. But Steingraber says roughly 20 billion tokens remain in public hands after accounting for locks, burns, and lost keys. If big institutions lock away most of that, circulation could shrink to under 100 million. That would set the stage for a classic supply shock. He even predicts prices could surge from cents to thousands of dollars within hours once companies dive in. Regulatory And Competition Hurdles Despite the excitement, there are clear roadblocks. XRP is still fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court. A final loss could stall deals or scare off banks. At the same time, rival chains like Ethereum and Solana also host tokenized assets. Those networks already see billions in daily volume. XRP would need to prove it offers something stronger or faster to win over big players. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin\u2019s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength A Long Shot With Big Ifs This forecast hinges on three big \u201cifs\u201d: strong tokenization growth, banks stacking XRP as reserves, and a real supply squeeze on public markets. If any one of those doesn\u2019t materialize, the $20,000 mark drifts further away. Still, it makes for a gripping story. For now, XRP traders will watch legal filings and ledger activity with fresh eyes, wondering if this bold theory has any chance of coming true. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-weeks-away-from-third-golden-cross/",
      "summary": "The price of Litecoin didn\u2019t end May in the best possible way, especially considering its start to the month, falling from around $95 to beneath $85 before May 31st. While the start of June was quite strong, the altcoin has failed to maintain its bullish momentum each time a rally seemed to be on. After falling beneath the $80 level on June 22, the Litecoin price seems to be back on its feet as it currently dances around the $87 mark. Interestingly, a fresh price outlook portraying an even brighter future for the cryptocurrency has emerged. How Much LTC Price Surged After First Two Golden Crosses In a recent post on the X platform, Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino shared an exciting analysis of the Litecoin price. According to the crypto expert, the price of LTC could embark on an explosive rally depending on its movement over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Cardano Price Woes To Continue? Analyst Expects ADA To Fall To $0.47 This bullish projection is based on the potential formation of a Golden Cross \u2014 the third ever \u2014 on the Litecoin weekly chart. In a crypto context, a Golden Cross occurs when a short-term moving average (50-week moving average, in this case) crosses above a longer-term moving average (200-week moving average). Typically, Golden Cross formations often precede and are associated with extended periods of bullish price movements. However, Severino believes that Litecoin is just weeks of a significant rally away from triggering its third-ever Golden Cross on the weekly price chart. Source: @TonyTheBullCMT on X Severino cited the earlier two situations where the Golden Cross occurred after a substantial price rally. In the first instance, this chart phenomenon appeared on the Litecoin weekly timeframe after a 700% surge from the local lows in 2017. Meanwhile, the LTC rallied by 450% from its local bottom before the second-ever Golden Cross in 2021. For each time the Golden Cross appeared on the chart, the price of Litecoin witnessed a significant bullish momentum. In 2017, the LTC price soared by 7,100% from around $5 to as high as $360. The altcoin jumped by more than 380% to reach its current all-time high of $410 after the Golden Cross formation in 2021. If the Golden Cross does occur and history is anything to go by, the Litecoin price could be preparing to reach a new all-time high in its next leg up. Litecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $86.26, reflecting a 1.7% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the altcoin is up by more than 7% in the last seven days.
