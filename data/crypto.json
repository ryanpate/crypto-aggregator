      "summary": "Bitcoin is treading cautiously below the $110,000 level, signaling a pause in momentum after recent highs. At the time of writing, the asset is priced at $106,841, marking a mild 0.4% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite brushing a daily high of $107,884, BTC appears to be consolidating in a narrow range, with market participants watching for the next significant move. Amid this relatively flat price action, on-chain trends suggest that not all is quiet under the surface. A new analysis by CryptoQuant contributor \u201coinonen\u201d sheds light on wallet activity within Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction Bitcoin Mid-Tier Investors Take Center Stage on Binance Oinonen&#8217;s findings point to a sharp increase in whale-level participation, as well as a notable contribution from mid-tier investors, which could have implications for broader market behavior. Citing CryptoQuant\u2019s on-chain metrics, the analyst revealed that Binance\u2019s inflow data shows that wallets depositing between 10 and 100 BTC now account for 40% of all Bitcoin inflows. These wallet sizes typically belong to high-net-worth individuals, trading firms, or mid-sized institutions\u2014those who sit between retail traders and deep-pocketed whales. In contrast, whale-level inflows (100\u20131,000 BTC) currently represent 20% of the total, highlighting that mid-tier players may be driving more exchange activity than larger whales at this time. Interestingly, whale activity still made a major appearance recently. On June 16, inflows of 10,000 BTC surged and made up 83% of total exchange inflows on Binance that day, reinforcing earlier observations from Oinonen about increased whale presence over the past year. According to CryptoQuant\u2019s whale ratio metric, that presence has reportedly jumped by as much as 400% since mid-2023. Binance Deposit Data Points to Rising Institutional Interest Beyond just inflow ratios, Binance\u2019s overall deposit metrics suggest a growing trend of larger average deposits. The average Bitcoin deposit rose from 0.36 BTC in 2023 to 1.65 BTC in 2024. The exchange processed $21.6 billion in user fund deposits in 2024, roughly 40% more than the combined totals of the next ten crypto exchanges. Despite the growing institutional footprint, the significant portion of deposits in the 10\u2013100 BTC range shows that mid-level market participants remain active contributors to the trading ecosystem. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer This data may reflect a broader shift in how BTC is being accumulated and moved, where influence is shared between whales and mid-sized investors. While whale flows often generate headlines, the consistent presence of mid-tier wallets can signal healthier market participation and a more distributed form of liquidity provision across the board. With Bitcoin still consolidating near key price levels, these on-chain trends could help shape its next breakout, whenever it comes. Featured image created with DALL-E. Chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-reclaims-2500-in-squeeze-driven-rally-but-can-it-hold/",
      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) has recorded strong gains over the past two weeks, rising from $2,111 on June 12 to $2,515 on June 25, reigniting hopes for a sustained bullish rally that could push the digital asset beyond the crucial $3,000 level. Ethereum Rally Marked By Shift In Dynamics According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Ethereum\u2019s latest rally has been accompanied by a notable shift in market dynamics &#8211; including a flip to positive funding rates, a potential short squeeze, and a rise in ETH inflows to Binance crypto exchange. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge Recent data from Binance reveals a significant shift in ETH funding rates from negative to positive. Positive funding rates typically indicate that traders are opening or holding leveraged long positions, reflecting expectations of further upside. However, rising funding rates may also raise the risk of a short-term price pullback if long positions become overextended. Data from CoinGlass shows that 68.15% of liquidations over the past 24 hours were long positions &#8211; highlighting this risk. Taha also emphasized the role of a short squeeze in Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge and the increase in funding rates. As ETH&#8217;s price climbed, it retested the previous short-squeeze zone around $2,500. He explained: In that earlier event, short positions were forcibly closed by initiating aggressive market buy orders to cover their exposure, triggering a cascading effect known as a short squeeze. This dynamic occurs when traders who had bet against ETH (shorts) are forced to close their positions by aggressively buying back the asset to limit losses. Meanwhile, ETH inflows to Binance have also spiked. On-chain exchange data suggests that 177,000 ETH was deposited into Binance over a three-day period &#8211; an unusually high volume. Such a surge typically signals increased selling pressure or large-scale repositioning by major holders. Large transfers of ETH to exchanges often precede either potential sell-offs or liquidity provisioning. In conclusion, Taha noted that while a short-term correction may be likely, ETH\u2019s breakout above $2,500 underscores the aggressive speculative activity driving its recent price action. Traders are advised to closely monitor funding rates and exchange flows for signs of an impending retracement. ETH Bulls Take The Charge Recent technical analysis suggests ETH may be gearing up for a breakout above the $2,800 resistance level. The asset also recently formed a golden cross on the daily chart, fuelling speculation that a new all-time high (ATH) could be within reach.

      "summary": "A federal judge has rejected Ripple and the SEC&#8217;s proposed $50 million settlement, but social media sentiment around XRP has turned bullish anyway. Ripple-SEC Settlement Stalled After Court Rejection The Ripple-SEC case seemed to be moving forward after both parties agreed on a reduced $50 million settlement, but the joint motion for an indicative ruling has now been rejected in court. According to the filing shared by defense lawyer James K. Filian in an X post, the two haven&#8217;t &#8220;come close&#8221; to showing exceptional circumstances outweighing public interest or the administration of justice that would justify modifying the judgment. This means that the original fine of $125 million still stands for Ripple. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Shoots Up: Warning For BTC? Following the news, XRP has taken a bearish hit to its price, as the below chart displays. The asset was trading around $2.15 at the time the news broke out, but it has since fallen below $2.09, implying a decrease of around 3%. Naturally, this reaction is quite mild by the cryptocurrency sector&#8217;s standards, but could still suggest some panic selling. Sentiment among the retail crowd, however, has seen a surprising jump, as per social media data. XRP Sentiment On Social Media Has Seen A Bullish Jump In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the social media users have responded to news of the Ripple-SEC case stalling. The indicator shared by Santiment is the &#8220;Positive/Negative Sentiment,&#8221; gauging the ratio between positive and negative comments involving a given coin on the major social media platforms. The indicator separates between positive and negative posts/threads/messages on the platforms using a machine-learning model and determines how the counts of the two compare. Here is a chart that shows the latest trend in the metric for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP: As displayed in the above graph, the Positive/Negative Sentiment is currently above the 1 mark for all three of these cryptocurrencies, indicating that posts pertaining to bullish sentiment outweigh the bearish ones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction For Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, the positive comments only have a slight advantage, meaning that while optimism does exist among the crowd, it&#8217;s quite mild. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that XRP has diverged from these assets with a sharp spike, which has taken its Positive/Negative Sentiment to a value of 2.1. This is the highest level for the cryptocurrency in 17 days and corresponds to there being more than double as many bullish calls as bearish ones. Often, retail sentiment acts as a contrarian signal, with extreme values in either direction leading to some sort of reversal in the price. As such, while this development in crowd mentality could potentially imply investors aren&#8217;t worried about the news, the indicator could still be to keep an eye on.

      "title": "Analyst Spots Bitcoin Time Bomb Hidden In Bullish Weekly Chart",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-time-bomb-hidden-bullish-weekly-chart/",
      "summary": "In a post on 27 June, crypto-market chartist Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) warned that Bitcoin\u2019s ostensibly bullish weekly structure may be concealing a latent \u201ctime bomb\u201d that could detonate if bulls fail to force a decisive breakout over the next three to four weeks. The technician\u2019s diagnosis hinges on a classic Ichimoku paradox: an expanding bullish kumo and a flat Kijun Sen on the weekly timeframe are clustering with a constellation of bearish warnings on the daily and two-day charts. Bitcoin Faces A July Time Bomb \u201cLook at the weekly kumo: it\u2019s expanding, widening,\u201d Dr Cat began. \u201cThis means that bullish momentum is building for potential trend sustainability even though the trend is not active as Kijun Sen is flat.\u201d The observation is significant because an enlarging kumo\u2014formed by the Senkou Span A/B envelope\u2014generally represents thickening support, making sudden breakdowns statistically less probable as long as the cloud keeps widening. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer At the same time, the Chikou Span (CS) is \u201cabove the candles without a gap,\u201d but, Dr Cat cautioned, it has \u201c4 weeks deadline to close above ATH or will enter the candles.\u201d Should the lagging line be absorbed back into price, the textbook interpretation is a loss of bullish conviction at the largest visible scale. That ostensibly constructive weekly backdrop contrasts starkly with a \u201clot of red flags on the daily hinting for a bearish scenario which can escalate on many levels.\u201d Among those alarms is the prospect of a death TK cross on the two-day chart, anticipated \u201ctonight,\u201d in which the Tenkan Sen slips below the Kijun Sen\u2014often the prelude to a down-leg when it materialises beneath the cloud. \u201cSo how do you interpret such conflicting information from different timeframes?\u201d the analyst asked rhetorically, underscoring that traders who privilege only a single interval risk being blindsided. Dr Cat\u2019s answer is a roadmap defined by time. Because the weekly cloud continues expanding, \u201cit is hard for the price to dump a lot\u201d immediately; historically, the kumo \u201cneeds first to become flat.\u201d The flattening mechanism is mechanical: if Bitcoin fails to record a fresh all-time high \u201cin 2 weeks from now,\u201d roughly by the week that begins 14 July, the leading Senkou Span A numerator will stop rising, truncating cloud expansion. That in turn opens a window for gravity to reassert itself on the higher timeframe. Against that backdrop the analyst offered two conditional trajectories. First scenario: bearish signals on the lower charts mature. \u201cThe price will likely need at least 1.5 month or so for a very big dump on the weekly scale, because the weekly kumo will keep expanding for 2 more weeks,\u201d Dr Cat wrote. During that holding period the market could \u201crange around / just do small dumps to the $90s,\u201d a reference to the high&#8211;$90 000 zone that has defined range lows since late spring. Should this grind continue beyond the second half of July without a structural shift on daily Ichimoku metrics, weekly momentum would invert: the kumo would cease expanding and the CS would dive into prior candles, removing two of the most durable layers of longer-term support. Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts New Bitcoin Peak Timeline And \u2018Double Cycle Blowoff\u2019 Second scenario: bulls seize the initiative. To \u201csave the chart from the warning signs,\u201d buyers must engineer \u201ca higher high above the $110,600 high shortly after the 27th of June,\u201d thereby invalidating the bearish daily setup and re-energising the top-down trend. Time is critical: after \u201cthe week starting on 14th of July,\u201d the CS will approach prior candlesticks, making each subsequent failure to print a new high proportionally more damaging. Dr Cat locates a final decision node on \u201cthe Sunday of the week starting on the 14th of July\u201d\u201420 July\u2014when the interplay between a stalling cloud and an in-candle CS could arm an additional set of \u201cred flags for bulls.\u201d"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-go-below-99000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin returned to its familiar price range over the week after a dip last weekend brought its price to just under $99,000. This was followed by a bounce to the $106,000 price level, which has given bulls a reason to remain hopeful. However, on-chain data shows some deeper cracks are forming beneath the surface. The latest on-chain data from analytics firm Glassnode shows growing signs of fatigue in both spot and futures markets. These are conditions that may again cause Bitcoin price to retest $99,000. Price Support Holds, But Momentum is Clearly Fading Bitcoin has gone through multiple price swings in recent days, but it has found its way back to the narrow $100,000 to $110,000 band that has defined market structure since early May. On-chain data from Glassnode shows that strong accumulation between $93,000 and $100,000, which is visible on the Cumulative Volume Delta (CBD) Heatmap, has so far served as a buffer zone that helped Bitcoin&#8217;s prices bounce during the most recent geopolitical volatility. However, market volume indicates that this structural support may soon face additional pressure. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer According to the latest weekly report by Glassnode, investor profitability and engagement surrounding Bitcoin are cooling rapidly. Specifically, a third major wave of profit-taking is causing the 30-day realized profit average to taper, and on-chain activity has decreased significantly. The 7-day moving average of on-chain transfer volume has dropped by about 32%, from a peak of $76 billion in late May to $52 billion over the recent weekend. Current spot volume trading, which is now at just $7.7 billion, is far below the volumes seen during previous rallies. The lack of strong buying enthusiasm on the spot market shows that bullish sentiment has been replaced by caution. As such, the risk of a breakdown below $99,000 grows unless another wave of demand re-enters. Futures Market Also Cooling Off The slowdown in sentiment is not limited to the spot market. Although Bitcoin is attracting interest on derivatives exchanges, there are clear signs that futures sentiment is waning. Open interest dropped by 7% over the weekend, from 360,000 BTC to 334,000 BTC, and funding rates have been declining steadily since Bitcoin hit its Q1 2025 all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align Futures market participants had been very active through Bitcoin\u2019s climb to $111,800 in May, but their conviction appears to be fading now. A further indication of a growing reluctance to hold long positions is the sharp decline in both the annualized funding rate and the 3-month rolling basis. Without stronger directional conviction, the futures markets may not provide the upside needed to push Bitcoin to new highs. This situation may instead contribute to additional downward pressure. So far, Bitcoin has respected the $93,000 to $100,000 support zone, which was heavily accumulated during the Q1 2025 top formation. However, with low spot volumes, on-chain activity slowing, and fading futures sentiment, this support could become tested again. If market participants with a cost basis in this zone begin to sell, the resulting pressure could drag Bitcoin below $99,000 again next week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,100.
