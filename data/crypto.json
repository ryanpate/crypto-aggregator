      "summary": "Market tactician Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) has put a statistical spotlight on Bitcoin\u2019s habit of dozing through June before rewarding \u2013 and sometimes punishing \u2013 traders in the following quarter. \u201cBTC June has historically been a pretty slow month,\u201d he wrote, noting that the just-ended period was no exception, with spot prices meandering in a narrow band and finishing \u201cpretty flat.\u201d The comment was accompanied by a Coinglass heat-map of monthly returns that reaches back to 2013 and vividly illustrates the summer pattern he is talking about. What July Hides For Bitcoin The numbers support the observation. According to the Coinglass dataset, the mean return for June over the past twelve years is essentially zero (-0.12 %), while July posts a respectable +7.56% on average and an even stronger +8.90 % on the median. August cools to a modest +1.75% mean, and September is where the sell-side pressure historically bites, averaging -3.77% with a negative median of -4.35%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freezes Over $100,000 As OG Whales \u2018Dump On Wall Street\u2019: Expert A simple frequency count underscores the asymmetry: July has finished green in eight of the last twelve years, whereas August and September managed only four positive outcomes each. Years that veterans still recall \u2013 2017\u2019s +65.32 % August melt-up followed by a -7.44 % September slide, or 2020\u2019s +24.03 % July rally that surrendered to a -7.51 % September pullback \u2013 appear to have etched the \u201cbig flush-out\u201d narrative into collective memory. Daan\u2019s takeaway is behavioural rather than predictive: \u201cAugust &#38; September are where we often see a big flush-out but are also the dips you often want to be buying into the end-of-the-year rally\u2026 it\u2019s good to be aware of these seasonalities. That way you can focus more on the larger timeframe and won\u2019t get spooked or get over-excited too easily.\u201d The comment arrives just as Bitcoin tests a cluster of long-timeframe resistances. In a post on Saturday he reminded followers that BTC is \u201cclose to all-time high but at resistance\u2026 [it] is yet to close a weekly or more than two consecutive daily candles above that resistance. Once it does, we can start getting excited for a larger move.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Are Taking Fresh Market Positions, But Are They Safe? The seasonality conversation matters because it collides with a crowded macro calendar and a notoriously illiquid holiday stretch. While historical averages do not guarantee future performance, the heat-map suggests that directional conviction often returns in October \u2013 the best-performing month on the table with a +21.89 % mean. For traders, that leaves a two-month corridor in which whipsaw moves are common and positioning discipline becomes paramount. Daan extends the framework to altcoins via the TOTAL3 index (crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ether). \u201cThe TOTAL Altcoin Market Cap has held on to its local support but is still not showing any clear trend\u2026 to really get this high timeframe move going you want to break those local highs above the ~$950 B mark. At that point you can start aiming for cycle highs.\u201d Whether 2025 repeats the seasonality script will hinge on the macro environment, ETF inflows and, above all, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to convert resistance into fresh price discovery. Until that weekly close arrives, seasoned traders appear content to keep summer expectations firmly tethered to the data \u2013 exactly as Daan recommends. At press time, BTC traded at $107,344.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-pressure-top-10-coin-loss-exceeds-profit/",
      "summary": "On-chain data shows Dogecoin is the only cryptocurrency among the top 10 where investors are currently realizing more losses than profits. Dogecoin Investors Realized $124 Million In Loss Over The Last 24 Hours In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared how the major cryptocurrencies compare against each other in terms of the Realized Loss and Realized Profit metrics. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish These indicators measure, as their names already imply, the amount of loss/profit that the investors on a given network are realizing through their transactions right now. The metrics work by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous value is less than the price that the coin&#8217;s now being sold at, then the token&#8217;s sale is leading to profit realization. On the other hand, it being higher suggests loss realization. The Realized Profit sums up the difference between the two prices involved in all sales of the former type, while the Realized Loss does the same for the latter ones. Now, here is the table shared by the analytics firm that shows how the 24-hour values of the two metrics currently stack up for the top 10 coins by market cap: As is visible above, the scale of the Realized Loss and Realized Profit differs greatly between the different assets, but one pattern is consistent: the latter outweighs the former, implying a trend of net profit-taking from the investors. One asset, however, doesn&#8217;t fit the mold: Dogecoin. The 24-hour Realized Loss for the memecoin stands at around $132 million, while the Realized Profit is much lower with a value of just $5 million. As such, it would appear that while the participants in the rest of the sector have been harvesting gains, DOGE holders have been panic capitulating at a loss instead. Among these top coins, the investors of Bitcoin have realized the largest profit, with the indicator&#8217;s value sitting at a whopping $1.3 billion. The Realized Loss is also restricted to just $33 million for the number one cryptocurrency, indicating selling has been heavily lopsided toward profit-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Shoots Up: Warning For BTC? Things are more balanced for Ethereum, the digital asset ranked number two. Its Realized Loss of $18.4 million is roughly half that of its Realized Profit of $35.2 million. The fact that profit realization is so dominant for the likes of Bitcoin, however, might actually be a bearish sign. Historically, such market conditions have made tops more likely. A dominance of loss-taking, on the other hand, can facilitate reversals to the upside. As such, while not a given, Dogecoin may not be in a bad position, at least in this regard. DOGE Price Dogecoin touched the $0.170 mark during the weekend, but the memecoin has seen a retrace under $0.165 to kick off the week.

      "summary": "US regulators and market watchers are eyeing a fresh valuation study that puts XRP on track for a dramatic price surge by 2030. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin\u2019s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength According to Valhil Capital\u2019s deep\u2011dive report, XRP could climb from its current price into a range between $4,813 and $9,000 in just five years. That forecast hinges on a model that treats XRP not only as a quick way to move money but also as a store of value. Model Weighs Store Of Value According to the Athey &#38; Mitchnick Model used by Valhil Capital, XRP\u2019s role goes way beyond sending payments. The study gives much more weight to people holding XRP like they would gold. In their view, as more folks start treating XRP as a place to park money, fewer coins stay in circulation. That tight supply pushes the price higher. The model blends economic ideas, real\u2011world trends, and crypto market moves to arrive at its numbers. Key Figures Drive Forecast Based on reports, the model assumes daily transactions on XRP Ledger will hit $700 billion by 2030. It uses a one\u2011second transaction speed and the current 56.5 billion XRP supply. With a 10% discount rate and a five\u2011year adoption window, the study pegs a mid\u2011case price of $4,813 if about 10% of global payments run on XRPL. In a more bullish view, the researchers push store\u2011of\u2011value demand to $1 quadrillion, which shoots the price beyond $9,000. Even a $100 trillion demand level would land XRP at $908 per token. Virtuous Cycle Could Fuel Growth Based on reports from Valhil Capital, the so\u2011called Virtuous Cycle Flywheel could spark a feedback loop. First, higher use of XRP for cross\u2011border payments and FX trades drives up demand. Then, price gains lure more holders to lock away their coins, shrinking the free float. That scarcity pushes prices even higher. As value climbs, new use cases could pop up, drawing in more users and adding another spin to the cycle. Regulation And Competition Loom Large XRP\u2019s path to mass use isn\u2019t smooth. Legal questions still swirl around its status in the US and elsewhere. That uncertainty may scare off big financial players. Plus, central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, and rival blockchains are all chasing the same slice of the cross\u2011border market. Related Reading: Crypto Bombshell: Developer Claims XRP Could Hit $20,000 Valhil Capital calls its forecast \u201cconservative\u201d because it skips markets like derivatives and real estate. Yet it also admits it can\u2019t guess future rules or fresh ways people might use XRP. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
