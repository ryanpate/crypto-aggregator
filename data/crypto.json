      "summary": "Bitcoin has rebounded slightly after dropping below the $100,000 mark, a decline attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions. The digital asset reached lows of approximately $98,974 following reports of US military strikes on Iran. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has regained some ground and is trading at $102,1010, representing a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours and a 5.82% decrease over the last week. Amid this price performance, recent on-chain analysis points to a phase of consolidation rather than a structural breakdown. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared in a QuickTake post that long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be maintaining their positions rather than exiting, indicating continued conviction despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Signal Consolidation, Not Capitulation According to Darkfost, the current market behavior is reflective of a quiet consolidation period, with long-term holders showing little inclination to sell. Based on the 30-day moving average of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), his analysis shows that the metric has stayed below the 0.8 threshold typically associated with major corrections. The value recently peaked at 0.6 before trending downward, suggesting limited market overheating at present levels. Darkfost emphasized that this moderation could precede a continuation of the broader bull cycle, mirroring past market structures where consolidation phases led to further price advances. He noted that past bull runs have often been characterized by a \u201cstaircase\u201d trajectory, periods of sideways or modest downward movement followed by renewed upward momentum. In this context, subdued sentiment may indicate that the market is preparing for a potential next leg higher. The analyst wrote: Importantly, this does not signal the end of the bull cycle. Instead, similar to the past two phases, we may once again see a staircase-like movement where consolidation is followed by another leg up. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move. Whale Behavior Remains Steady Amid Market Tensions Complementing this outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, provided insight into whale activity during the current consolidation phase. He noted that while the market setup resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021, key on-chain signals from whales have not aligned with those seen during that previous peak. Specifically, Ethereum transaction outflows, often used as a proxy for large investor exits, have not shown the kind of spikes observed during the 2021 market top. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Mignolet pointed out that although Ethereum has seen a gradual decline in market share relative to other layer-1 and layer-2 chains since 2020, its transactional data still maintains a strong correlation with Bitcoin price movements. The absence of aggressive exit activity among large holders suggests that major market participants are not rushing for the exits, despite heightened geopolitical uncertainty and short-term price volatility.

Investors seem to be treating this pullback as a chance to buy, not a reason to sell. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead The Pack According to CoinShares data, Bitcoin pulled in $1.114 billion this week alone. It has now logged $2.37 billion month-to-date and $12.7 billion YTD, across nearly $152 billion in assets under management. Ethereum chipped in with its ninth straight week of gains, adding $124 million in weekly inflows. That pushed its month-to-date total past $1 billion and its YTD figure to $2.43 billion, across $14.29 billion of assets. Investors aren\u2019t scooping up bearish bets, either: short Bitcoin products saw just $1.4 million in outflows this week and $8.7 million since January. Altcoins See Mixed Results Solana attracted $2.80 million this week and nearly $3 million month-to-date, lifting its YTD flows to almost $86 million. XRP pulled in $2.70 million weekly and $10.55 million month-to-date, taking its year-long total to $268 million across $1.205 billion in managed assets. But funds that package multiple tokens bled $5.76 million this week and almost $17 million for the month\u2014though they\u2019re still up $58 million in 2025.

That\u2019s $3.37 billion month-to-date and $14.30 billion YTD, out of $135 billion under management. Canada added nearly $21 million this week and $42.8 million for June. Germany chipped in almost $11 million while Australia booked $16.6 million. Brazil bucked the trend with $9 million of outflows this week and $26.4 million in June, but it\u2019s still about $34.8 million ahead for the year. Smaller Tokens Struggle For Attention Some newer names drew mixed reactions. Sui saw $8.5 million drain this week despite $3.3 million of gains so far in June. Litecoin eked out $0.21 million in weekly inflows and clos to $6 million YTD. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free\u2014Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Cardano and Chainlink grabbed $0.34 million and $0.6 million this week, respectively.

Institutions are still finding reasons to back crypto even as global events and holiday thins slow trading. Total weekly flows hit $1.23 billion, taking June\u2019s total to $3.38 billion and the year\u2019s to $15 billion, across $176 billion in overall assets. Based on these trends, big spenders aren\u2019t ready to abandon digital tokens. They\u2019re treating pullbacks like offers they can\u2019t pass up.
