      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-seasonality-summer-2025/",
      "summary": "A growing number of Bitcoin and crypto market participants have fallen victim to a dangerous assumption: that summer in the crypto markets is synonymous with stagnation. However, crypto analyst Cristian Chifoi warns that this summer may follow a drastically different script. In a video analysis released on July 1, Chifoi lays out a compelling case that 2025 fits a historical pattern that has previously delivered some of Bitcoin\u2019s strongest summer performances. Summer 2025 Could Flip Bitcoin\u2019s Script Chifoi\u2019s thesis is based on a concept he has long explored: Bitcoin seasonality\u2014a recurring, cyclical behavior in Bitcoin\u2019s price action across the calendar year, especially in relation to the four-year halving cycles. According to Chifoi, there is an identifiable seasonal window from mid-January to mid-March where Bitcoin historically shows explosive movement in one direction, only to reverse course in the subsequent months. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm\u2014Bitcoin Could Explode Soon This pattern has held across multiple years and cycles. In 2021, for example, Bitcoin rallied from $28,000 to $60,000 between January and March before collapsing back to $28,000 by summer. The opposite occurred in 2023, when Bitcoin dumped in Q1 and reversed upwards during summer. \u201cFrom January 22nd to March 11th [2024], we had a 2x on Bitcoin,\u201d Chifoi noted. \u201cAnd if the price moves in one direction in this window, it tends to do the exact opposite after that. That\u2019s the seasonality reversal.\u201d Chifoi highlighted this tendency across previous cycles as well, identifying the same trend flip in 2022, 2023, and most notably in 2021. Critically, Chifoi warns that while most traders are anchored to the recent past\u2014recalling three consecutive \u201cboring\u201d summers\u2014this year is historically aligned with a different kind of setup. \u201cNobody is prepared for this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause people only look at the past three years. But those were not the years to look at.\u201d Instead, Chifoi compares 2025 to three historical analogues: 2013, 2017, and 2021\u2014all years that followed a halving and saw significant summer rallies. In each of those years, after early-year volatility or corrections, Bitcoin posted dramatic gains from mid-July into early September. In 2017, Bitcoin rallied 160% in that timeframe. In 2021, the move was 77%. \u201cThe common factor in those years? They were one year after a halving, with a post-March reversal in trend,\u201d Chifoi explained. \u201cNow we are in the same window again. And people are not looking at it.\u201d First Crash, Then Surge? The analyst also emphasized that current price action fits his broader fractal thesis. After Bitcoin\u2019s local top at $109K earlier this year and the rejection that followed, the market appears to be chopping sideways\u2014something he predicted back in late 2024. He expects this phase to continue into July 20, potentially ending with a sudden flush to the downside. But this, he argues, would be the setup for the next leg higher. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if the drop comes with a lot of bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a dump before a rally, the media has a narrative ready. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s real. It just means the market is doing what it always does\u2014shake out the majority.\u201d Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 \u2014 Details Chifoi also addressed broader market confluences, notably pointing out similar behavior in the S&#38;P 500, where a corrective move in early July appears to align with his crypto timing model. He expects a pullback in both markets to precede the next upward thrust, targeting a Fibonacci resistance zone that historically acts as a pause point during price discovery. Despite his bullishness, Chifoi made it clear he\u2019s not buying Bitcoin right now. \u201cI already bought below $20K,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m watching altcoin charts, looking for pullbacks to accumulate.\u201d He expressed frustration at the prevailing narratives circulating among large X accounts, particularly those pushing for rotating altcoins into Bitcoin under the assumption that dominance will rise indefinitely. \u201cThis is very stupid,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cThe market is behaving exactly as it should\u2014for the fewest number of people to make money.\u201d In closing, Chifoi cautioned that those who insist on saying this time is different will likely find themselves on the wrong side of the trade. \u201cOnly if this time is different will this not play out. But if you base your strategy on those words, I can guarantee you 99% of the time, you won\u2019t make money.\u201d As the July 20 pivot approaches, Chifoi\u2019s analysis suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s next move may catch a complacent market off guard. Whether or not history rhymes once more, the veteran analyst has made his stance clear: this is not a summer to sleep through. At press time, BTC traded at $106,880.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-startups-raise-1-15b-last-month-will-crypto-icos-like-btcbull-take-off-next/",
      "summary": "June was a strong month for the crypto and Web3 sectors, with related startups successfully raising a collective $1.15B across 140 deals. This represents a 3% increase in raised capital and a 9% increase in the number of deals compared to May, according to crypto market intelligence firm, Messari. The upward trend highlights growing confidence among angel investors in the potential of decentralized technologies. Big winners this round include Kalshi, a predictions market, which secured an $185M round, and Digital Asset, which raised $135M to develop its Canton blockchain. Private token sales also saw a resurgence, with World Liberty Finance bringing in $100M and Eigen Labs securing $70M. These figures paint a vibrant and expanding picture of growth and innovation within the crypto industry. Key Innovations Driving Investor Confidence Diving beyond the figures, the nature of the startups points to a focus on innovative and foundational technologies. Crypto startup, Zama FHE, for example, successfully closed a $57M Series B round, achieving a $1B valuation for its fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technology. Investments in privacy solutions show a growing recognition of the importance of secure and scalable infrastructure for the future of Web3. Increasing deal counts and interest in core technological advancements are strong signals of the health and growth of blockchain and Web3 applications. Investors seek opportunities that align with market trends and demonstrate innovation and institutional confidence. Enter BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL), a crypto ICO that offers direct pathways to capitalize on the market&#8217;s upward trajectory, making it one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Harnessing Bitcoin\u2019s Momentum with BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) As the crypto landscape evolves, new low-cap projects emerge that leverage the strength of established assets. Among these, BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) provides a new and low-cost way for retail investors to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s ascent. Just days from the end of its presale, $BTCBULL tracks and benefits from Bitcoin\u2019s price movements, letting holders participate in the market\u2019s bullish cycles. It\u2019s built on the Ethereum blockchain, giving investors broad compatibility and accessibility, and leans into a bullish character, taking charge, helping $BTC reach $1M. Diverse Pathways to $BTC-Backed Returns Investing in $BTCBULL offers benefits beyond token appreciation. The biggest is the Bitcoin airdrops. As Bitcoin reaches significant price milestones ($150K and \u00a3200K), $BTCBULL holders who use Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets) can receive actual $BTC directly into their wallets. If that wasn\u2019t enough, $BTCBULL has a deflationary model implemented through milestone token burns. At specific $BTC price thresholds, a portion of the $BTCBULL supply is permanently removed from circulation, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially the value of the remaining tokens. If you&#8217;re looking for a passive-income vehicle, the $BTCBULL presale offers attractive staking rewards with competitive APYs available (currently 52%). However, you need to get in fast, as the presale ends on July 7. Looking ahead, the multi-faceted rewards system should incentivize long-term holding and engagement. If you buy $BTCBULL today for $0.002585, you could see a return of 2401% if it reaches our end-of-2025 price prediction of $0.06467. Seize the Market by the Horns June\u2019s crypto start-up funding figures and the continued push towards innovation paint a positive picture for the crypto market. For the savvy investor, picking projects like BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) to leverage the market\u2019s movements could be a smart move. Just be sure to act fast, as the presale is moments from closing, and with it, your chances of securing that free $BTC. Remember, this is not financial advice, and you should do your own research before making any investment decisions."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/expert-explains-why-bitcoin-remains-stuck-below-120000-despite-wall-streets-billions/",
      "summary": "As Bitcoin (BTC) experiences another dip, falling 5% below its record high of $111,800 reached during May\u2019s crypto rally, analysts are probing the reasons behind its stagnation in the $100,000 to $110,000 range. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst DanteX outlined the factors contributing to this price resistance and what it could mean for the remainder of 2025. What\u2019s Holding Bitcoin Back? Despite the substantial influx of nearly $5 billion in Bitcoin acquired through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in just a few weeks, the price of Bitcoin has failed to surpass the $120,000 target identified by analysts. Public companies, Strategy and GameStop, have joined the ranks of institutional buyers, marking a significant shift in corporate interest toward Bitcoin. This growing demand indicates that there are substantial buyers ready to purchase at prices above $100,000. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury However, DanteX asserts that the market has been characterized by an unusual phenomenon: the analyst alleges that someone appears to be \u201cstrategically offloading\u201d Bitcoin in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, effectively absorbing the demand and preventing upward movement. This selling pressure seems to come from a major player\u2014reportedly hedge funds or early investors\u2014actively liquidating positions to offset the inflow of institutional capital. Market Exhaustion Or Distribution? As the market enters the latter half of summer, a historically weak period for cryptocurrencies, concerns arise about liquidity and retail interest. DanteX noted that if the Bitcoin price cannot rally now, amid significant buying and market enthusiasm, the outlook may dim as trading volumes decline. The analyst further shared that the current price stagnation at near-record highs often indicates either market exhaustion or a distribution phase, suggesting that while demand exists, it is being countered by strategic selling. Despite the overall positive macroeconomic environment\u2014where stock markets are soaring, real yields are declining, and liquidity is increasing\u2014DanteX highlights that the Bitcoin price remains unresponsive. The analyst stated that it could imply that current holders may not be ready for a breakout or are intentionally limiting potential gains. Interestingly, when Bitcoin price movements stall, capital tends to flow into altcoins, which are often viewed as higher-risk, higher-reward investments. DanteX believes that the current skepticism surrounding the likelihood of an altcoin season amid the current market condition, could actually set the stage for one, as many investors remain \u201cunder-positioned.\u201d Record ETF Inflows Fail To Translate Into Price Gains The role of ETFs cannot be overlooked, DanteX further said. He said that while record inflows into ETFs signal strong institutional interest, they do not always correlate with immediate price increases, especially when met with significant selling pressure. DanteX notes that much of the exchange-traded fund exposure may be hedged or arbitraged, resulting in a complex market dynamic where asset growth does not immediately reflect in Bitcoin&#8217;s spot price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase Looking ahead, the analyst suggests monitoring the activity of large wallets, especially those exhibiting selling patterns that align with recent price suppression. Watching macroeconomic indicators, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts or shifts in the value of the dollar, is also said to be crucial as these factors could influence market sentiment.

      "title": "Altcoin Season Starting Soon? Analyst Predicts 37% Crash In Bitcoin Dominance",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin dominance remaining on the high side has been one of the major hindrances for the altcoin season. Going by past performances, the Bitcoin dominance would have to crash for altcoins to have a chance to rally, but with the dominance still climbing, the chances of an altcoin season remain slim. As this trend continues, a crypto analyst has predicted a possible turn in the tide for the Bitcoin dominance, predicting a crash that could give altcoins a chance. Bitcoin Dominance Rejection From Trendline Is Key Over the years, the Bitcoin dominance has been following a trendline that has often marked the point of resistance. This trendline rises from 2017 and has sloped down past 2021 and now into the year 2025. The significance behind this is the breakdown from the trendline and the Bitcoin dominance receding sharply from here. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs Presently, the Bitcoin dominance is still sitting high above 65% at the time of this writing, but this recent rise has seen it touch the resistance trendline. According to crypto analyst CoreCrypto, this is a critical inflection point, especially on the weekly chart. More importantly, this is usually the point where dominance recedes, giving rise to altcoin dominance. Some major developments that the analyst tells investors to watch on the dominance chart include a rejection from the resistance trendline, where the dominance currently lies above 65%. There is also support for the dominance, as shown by the yellow line in the chart below. A break below this support is critical for the fall in the dominance. Another development to watch out for is for rising Ethereum strength. In the past, the Ethereum price starting to outperform the Bitcoin price has often signaled the start of the altcoin season. So, as the ETHBTC chart begins to strengthen and Bitcoin succumbs to sideways movement, it opens the door for altcoins to rally into the next altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move In the event of a break from the resistance trendline, the analyst sees the possibility of a sharp decline. CoreCrypto predicts a 36.91% drop to the 42%-45% levels. This is lower compared to previous altcoin seasons, but follows the declining trend of a 50.79% drop in 2017 compared to a 45.10% drop in 2021. \u201cIf BTC.D gets rejected from this resistance again, it could mark the start of the long-awaited Altseason 2025,\u201d the crypto analyst explained. \u201cA breakdown from this wedge would likely result in capital rotation from BTC into altcoins \u2014 just like in previous cycles.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Solana started a fresh decline and retested the $145 support zone. SOL price is now recovering and might aim for a fresh increase above the $150 zone. SOL price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $160 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $147 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $152 resistance zone. Solana Price Trims Gains Solana price struggled to continue higher above $160 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL declined below the $155 and $152 support levels. It even dipped below $150 and tested the $145 zone. A low was formed at $144 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $147 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $150 level. The next major resistance is near the $152 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $160. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $145 zone. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $136 zone. If there is a close below the $136 support, the price could decline toward the $125 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.
