      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-could-rally-to-10000/",
      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s price action this week has been very notable, with the leading altcoin breaking above $2,800 again for the first time in four months. Ethereum managed to break above the $2,800 mark for the first time since February, briefly touching $2,870 before pulling back slightly. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 Cycle? Here\u2019s The Target Two separate analyses by crypto strategist Crypto Patel on the social media platform X suggests Ethereum is now on the right track. The first, based on an 8-hour chart, highlights a rally toward $4,000. The second, using a long-term two-week timeframe, outlines a bullish setup that could send Ethereum soaring to $10,000 and beyond. Ethereum\u2019s Breakout From Sideways Consolidation Zone In a recent analysis shared on X, a crypto analyst known as Crypto Patel highlighted Ethereum\u2019s attempt to break out of its established range. Using the 8-hour candlestick chart, he pointed out how the Ethereum had spent many weeks since early May trading between clear support at $2,366 and resistance around $2,734. The breakout seen on the chart occurred just above this resistance zone, when Ethereum briefly pushed past $2,800 before facing some rejection. If this breakout holds above $2,800, Ethereum could initiate a steep upward rally toward the $3,500 to $4,000 region in the coming weeks. Crypto Patel noted the importance of watching whether Ethereum sustains above the $2,750 breakout line, as a successful confirmation could trigger an influx of bullish momentum. Ethereum\u2019s To $10,000 In The Long-Term In a follow-up post analyzing a much larger timeframe, Crypto Patel shared a two-week candlestick chart that mapped Ethereum\u2019s longer-term structure since 2018. The chart revealed a well-defined bullish setup, including a bounce from a key bullish order block around $1,400 in April. This bounce acted as a support level, with the resulting candlestick being a bullish one that broke through another order block between $1,700 and $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Patel pointed out that Ethereum is now showing signs of a long-term bullish continuation pattern. With support levels already locked in for the next bear market, the analyst projected a target above $10,000, citing a 438% upside potential from current price levels. The chart also marks $2,500 as a structural pivot point, with Ethereum\u2019s ongoing upward trajectory expected to strengthen if this support level continues to hold. Therefore, the path to $10,000 will depend on Ethereum\u2019s ability to turn its recent resistance break into sustained momentum. The $2,800 region must now serve as a support base rather than a resistance ceiling. However, this has failed to really materialize in the past 24 hours, as Ethereum is currently down by a massive 9.6%. The ensuing price action has seen the leading altcoin now back trading within this consolidation range. Failure to hold above $2,500 could cascade to more losses over the weekend until it closes on $2,366 again and probably initiate another bounce from here.

      "summary": "\u201cMen lie, women lie, but charts and numbers do not lie,\u201d EGRAG CRYPTO stated in a recent post on X, as he highlighted the importance of the Fib 0.5 level in XRP Dominance. According to him, this level has historically served as a major resistance zone. It acted as a key barrier in October 2019 and November 2020, both instances marking the onset of bear markets. In the current cycle, the Fib 0.5 level has once again proven significant, as it has rejected price advances in January and March 2025. The Knocking On The Door Analogy For XRP To drive his point home, EGRAG CRYPTO introduced what he called the \u201cKnocking on the Door\u201d analogy, a simple yet powerful metaphor to explain how resistance levels work in technical analysis. He stated that resistance is like a door; each time it is tested or &#8220;knocked on,&#8221; the likelihood of it eventually opening increases. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Perfect Setup After Buy Retest \u2013 Next Stop $3.7 EGRAG pointed out that XRP Dominance has now tested this macro resistance level four separate times. These repeated tests are not just coincidences; they indicate building pressure at that level. Traders and analysts often interpret such repeated encounters as signs that the asset is preparing for a significant move, as momentum continues to build with each attempt to break through resistance. Looking ahead, EGRAG suggested that the fifth \u201cknock\u201d on this resistance level might be the one that finally breaks it. If this happens, XRP Dominance could form a bullish Bull Flag pattern, a technical formation that often precedes upward moves. According to EGRAG, this breakout could propel XRP Dominance to around 27%, marking a major shift in its market strength and possibly setting the stage for a broader bullish trend. Market Cap Projection &#38; Future Potential The analyst unveiled a compelling projection that has stirred excitement within the XRP community: if XRP reaches a price of $27 with a 27% market dominance, this could push the total market capitalization to $5.5 trillion. This bold forecast reflects not only the possible future strength of XRP but also envisions a significant expansion of the broader crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Price Takes a Breather\u2014Consolidation Phase or Bullish Setup? He further explained that with a $5.5 trillion total market cap, XRP claiming 27% of that share would result in a market capitalization of approximately $1.485 trillion. Such a figure would further solidify its status as a key player in the blockchain space. He maintained that XRP could still reach $27 while maintaining 27% market dominance, especially if the overall market experiences a strong bullish cycle. In his view, $1.485 trillion is not just a dream but a viable target that highlights XRP\u2019s massive growth potential. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

Gold\u2019s climb suggests that many feel uneasy about what comes next. Even so, some expect this spike to calm once tensions ease. What Comes Next For Crypto Short-term views remain mixed. Some traders see this as a knee-jerk reaction and expect a rebound once headlines fade. Others warn that the US CPI release later this week could add another twist. Inflation data could either fuel more selling or pave the way for relief if numbers come in cooler than expected.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-crash-to-94000-imminent/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price action has shown signs of fading momentum three weeks after reaching a new all-time high of $111,814. The leading cryptocurrency climbed back above $110,000 on Monday off the back of cooling U.S. inflation data and a temporarily weaker dollar. However, the rally was short-lived. Profit-taking, compounded by geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, has contributed to a risk-off environment that pushed Bitcoin down below $105,000 in the past 24 hours. This sharp reversal highlights a significant technical level that could decide whether Bitcoin sustains its uptrend or enters a crash towards $94,000. Final Fibonacci Resistance Holding The Line According to a new analysis shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst XForceGlobal on the social media platform X, Bitcoin\u2019s current corrective structure could deepen if it fails to overcome the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance level. The analyst highlighted that the bullish impulse that carried Bitcoin now appears to be losing steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 The price zone around $110,500, which is marked by the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance, has not been convincingly breached, casting doubt on the strength of the current wave structure. Bitcoin tested this level twice earlier this week, and, as noted by the analyst, if this resistance level fails to break soon, there is a slight possibility of a deeper pullback. If this pullback does occur, this would lead to the formation of a corrective wave C, and with distinct symmetry in an ABC corrective pattern. In this case of the corrective Wave C playing out, the next central area of interest lies around the $94,000 level, an area that aligns with the completion of a larger impulse Wave 2. Wave 2 Dip To $96,000 Before Bullish Wave 3 Begins The rundown of a corrective Wave 2 and a bearish impulse Wave 2 is based on the outlook of Bitcoin failing to clear the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance at $110,000. Applying the Elliott wave count on the current price action shows that the recent push to $111,814 all-time high was a larger bullish impulse Wave 1. However, the ensuing correction since then has also played out in the form of a sub-wave 123 structure, and an ABC corrective pattern. Altogether, these are expected to make up a larger corrective impulse Wave 2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Crash To $31,000 Amid 5-Wave Impulse Completion Nevertheless, XForceGlobal noted that Bitcoin is still in a highly bullish structure on the macro level. If the price action plays out this way, the next move after the impulse Wave 2 to $94,000 would be a reversal upwards with bullish impulse Wave 3. In this case, the analyst projected an expansion move that would send Bitcoin to another all-time high. Notably, the price target in this case would be a surge above $118,500. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000, down by 2.5% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-faces-stress-as-israel-iran-conflict-shakes-sentiment-eth-btc-support-in-focus/",
      "summary": "Ethereum faced intense selling pressure earlier today as geopolitical tensions flared following Israel\u2019s attack on Iran, shaking global markets and triggering risk-off behavior across crypto. The sudden spike in volatility pushed Ethereum away from its recent highs, as it retraced after failing to break above the critical $3,000 resistance level. This marks a pivotal moment for ETH, which had shown strong momentum in recent sessions before being hit by the broader market downturn. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History \u2013 Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally Despite the sharp correction, top analyst Quinten Francois remains optimistic. He pointed to the ETH/BTC pair, which continues to look strong relative to other assets. According to Francois, this pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle\u2014a pattern that often precedes a breakout to the upside if support holds. With Bitcoin holding near its range highs, Ethereum\u2019s performance against BTC could serve as a leading indicator for the broader altcoin market. Now, Ethereum stands at a crossroads. A bounce from current levels could renew bullish momentum and re-establish the $2,800\u2013$3,000 range as the launchpad for higher prices. But failure to hold support may trigger another wave of downside pressure. All eyes are on ETH/BTC as markets brace for what comes next. Ethereum Holds Key Level Against BTC Ethereum has been leading the crypto market with impressive strength since April, posting a remarkable surge of over 100% from its lows near $1,400. This steep recovery highlights Ethereum\u2019s growing momentum, positioning it as a potential frontrunner in triggering the next altseason. The asset\u2019s consistent performance above key support levels and its resilience during market dips have renewed bullish sentiment, with traders increasingly focusing on ETH as the key asset to watch. Many analysts believe Ethereum could be the spark that reignites capital rotation into altcoins. Its breakout from a month-long range, combined with increasing DeFi activity and improving on-chain metrics, has added to the bullish case. However, caution remains. Ongoing geopolitical tensions\u2014particularly the recent escalation between Israel and Iran\u2014are injecting volatility into global markets, including crypto. These developments have disrupted otherwise promising technical setups across the board, leading to uncertainty and risk-off sentiment. Quinten Francois commented on the current climate, noting that \u201csome charts don\u2019t look good, others are holding on by a thread.\u201d However, he singled out the ETH/BTC pair as a relative strength signal, stating that it \u201cstill looks good.\u201d This pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle\u2014a structure that, if defended, could pave the way for a continuation of ETH\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin. In this environment, Ethereum\u2019s performance\u2014especially relative to BTC\u2014could determine the broader market\u2019s next phase. If ETH/BTC holds and breaks higher, the door opens for a full altseason run. But a failure to hold could reinforce caution and signal a pause across the crypto market. For now, Ethereum remains the most important chart to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support \u2013 Can Bulls Defend This Level? ETH Faces Sharp Rejection After Tagging Range Highs Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test after a strong rejection near the $2,830 resistance level. The chart shows ETH failing to hold above the highlighted supply zone between $2,700 and $2,830, where sellers stepped in aggressively. This resulted in a sharp breakdown that sliced through the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) on the 4-hour timeframe, now positioning ETH around $2,512. What\u2019s more concerning is the spike in volume during the breakdown. This confirms the strength behind the move, signaling panic among bulls and potential distribution by short-term holders. ETH is now holding just above a previous support zone from early June, but the current setup suggests uncertainty and risk of further downside. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance \u2013 Breakout Or Breakdown? Unless Ethereum can reclaim the $2,600\u2013$2,620 area soon, the next likely target could be the $2,400 level, where the next strong demand cluster sits. However, if bulls defend current prices and manage a quick recovery back above the SMAs, this recent move could be interpreted as a liquidity sweep before continuation.
