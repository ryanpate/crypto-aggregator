      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-consolidating-below-108000-but-eyes-115000-target/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action has been relatively stable in recent days, currently trading just above $107,000 after briefly touching previous highs near $108,000. Amid this backdrop, technical analysis from a popular crypto analyst on the TradingView platform outlined a compelling structural setup forming on Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart. The analysis shows that Bitcoin&#8217;s action is in a compression phase that could precede a breakout to $115,000 very soon. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role Compression Structure Forming Below $108,000 Resistance Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is currently following movements in traditional risk assets like the S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq, both of which have recovered following the recent de-escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Against this backdrop, crypto analyst RLinda shared an outlook on TradingView that highlights a structural setup forming on the D1 chart and predicts a breakout to as high as $115,000 if some resistance levels are cleared. According to RLinda, Bitcoin is in the middle of a compression phase just below the $108,100 resistance level. This follows what the analyst describes as a false breakout above $100,000, which led to a brief distribution and now an active accumulation zone. The daily chart shows price action gradually tightening within the $106,500 to $108,100 range since June 25, the essence of which the analyst called a pause for a breather before a possible continuation of growth. The current setup has already established well-defined boundaries, with support at $106,500 and $108,100 as immediate resistance. A breakout above this immediate resistance would pave the way for the next resistance around $110,400 and bring Bitcoin within striking distance of its all-time high at $111,000. On the other hand, a short-term pullback toward $105,650 is still possible before a new move to the upside. Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is really pressing on this resistance level around $108,000 and is building momentum for a breakout once the price level gives way. The key resistance levels to monitor are stacked around $108,100, $108,900, and $110,400. As long as the structure between $106,500 and $108,100 holds, and Bitcoin&#8217;s price is sticky near the top of that zone, the breakout scenario becomes increasingly probable. Although there are currently no reasons for a decline on the daily and weekly candlestick charts, the analyst noted that a temporary pullback to $105,650 or even $104,650 cannot be ruled out. However, even such a pullback would likely only serve as a retest but still keep the broader setup intact.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trump-backs-bitcoin-latest-white-house-speech-best-crypto-to-buy-before-next-bull-run/",
      "summary": "In Friday&#8217;s White House press conference, Donald Trump yet again declared his support for Bitcoin, calling it &#8216;amazing&#8217; and pointing out its growing use in the economy. It has become amazing. I mean, it is the jobs that it produces, and I notice more and more you pay in Bitcoin. People are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it is a great thing for our country. \u2013 Donald Trump in latest White House speech In this article, we&#8217;ll quickly touch upon Trump&#8217;s latest pro-crypto comments, how they could spark another altcoin rally, and what the best crypto to buy is if you wish to capitalize on the momentum before the next leg up. Trump Says Bitcoin is Relieving Dollar Strain Easily the most notable piece of Trump&#8217;s speech was his claim that Bitcoin is relieving pressure off the US dollar. This is &#8216;a much more significant statement than what it seems at first glance,&#8217; says digital asset researcher Anders. According to Anders, Trump&#8217;s comment suggests he understands the &#8216;Triffin dilemma,&#8217; which is a long-standing economic paradox, and that he&#8217;s probably keen on using crypto to solve it. The Triffin dilemma is the term used to describe the conflict faced by the country (in this case, the USA) whose currency (the US dollar) serves as the world&#8217;s reserve currency. The &#8216;dilemma&#8217; is that while the US dollar becomes stronger by boosting its global demand, this very strength then widens the country&#8217;s trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes imports cheaper and exports become more expensive. Using a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin \u2013 or XRP, which is a more &#8216;US-made&#8217; crypto than $BTC \u2013 could help ease pressure on USD. If investments flow in the form of $BTC rather than $USD, it would reduce demand for the dollar, weakening it and, therefore, correcting the trade deficit. All in all, Trump&#8217;s renewed endorsement adds momentum to the crypto narrative. It positions Bitcoin (and potentially other tokens) as a genuinely strategic financial tool. With that in mind, here are a few cryptos that could benefit from Bitcoin&#8217;s latest tap on the shoulder. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Best Crypto to Buy Now, Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best cryptos to invest in right now because, first and foremost, it&#8217;s the ONLY one offering free $BTC to its token holders. Buy $BTCBULL and store it in Best Wallet, and whenever Bitcoin crosses $150K and $200K for the first time, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of free $BTC. Additionally, holding BTC Bull Token will also beef up your crypto portfolio. That&#8217;s because the token is predicted to surge 277% and reach $0.0096 by 2026. One $BTCBULL is currently priced at just $0.00258, and the project has in total raised over $7.6M (and counting) in early investor funding. Another reason for this new crypto&#8217;s potential bright future is its token burn mechanism. Simply put, the developers will shave off a part of the total token supply with rising Bitcoin prices. This will create artificial scarcity and upward price pressure, especially during Bitcoin bull runs. It&#8217;s a clever way of aligning the token&#8217;s growth with Bitcoin&#8217;s momentum. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Putting the Bitcoin Blockchain on Steroids Bitcoin is undoubtedly the OG crypto and blockchain, but it wasn&#8217;t really built with Web3 adoption in mind. It only processes seven transactions per second, as opposed to Solana&#8217;s 2K-3K TPS. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). This new meme coin on presale aims to build the first-ever Layer 2 on Bitcoin that will directly tackle the problems of scalability and programmability on the network. By leveraging a Canonical Bridge and integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it will convert your $BTC from a traditional L1 asset into a high-speed, scalable L2 asset. You&#8217;ll be able to use this &#8216;wrapped&#8217; Bitcoin on L2 for lightning-fast payments and swaps, as well as lending and staking on DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps. Also, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could be the next crypto to explode. It could reach $0.253 by 2030 \u2013 a nearly 2,000% gain from current prices. $HYPER is currently in presale, which is why you can buy it for a low price of $0.012075. Even though the presale is fresh out of the oven, it has amassed a chunky $1.7M so far. Here&#8217;s how to buy it. 3. Useless Coin ($USELESS) \u2013 Viral New Meme Coin with No Intrinsic Value or Utility Useless Coin ($USELESS) is the newest and perhaps the perfect epitome of what meme coins truly stand for: community-driven degen fun without any real utility or intrinsic value. With no staking, governance mechanisms, or revenue generation outside liquidity fees, $USELESS is almost a satirical take on all the other so-called utility tokens flooding the market right now. It launched just over a couple of weeks ago and has already gained over 92%. Currently trading at $0.1665, $USELESS is hitting new all-time highs as we speak, so this might be a good time to get in. Wrapping Up With Donald Trump&#8217;s latest remarks on Bitcoin signaling renewed support for the crypto world, high-potential newcomers like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) can surge big time. That said, keep in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky. This article isn&#8217;t financial advice, so only invest after doing your own research."

      "summary": "The US Bitcoin spot ETFs logged over $2 billion in net inflows last week, marking a three-week streak of positive momentum. Despite a bearish start to June, with $128.81 million in net outflows during the first trading week, investor appetite soon quickly rebounded. This turnaround has resulted in a cumulative $4.63 billion in deposits over the past three weeks. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin\u2019s Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength Bitcoin ETFs On Impressive 14-Day Positive Streak Despite Market Uncertainty On Friday June 27, the 12 US Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows of $501.27 million bringing the aggregate deposits of the last week to a staggering $2.22 billion. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the clean streak of daily inflows from last week extends the ETFs\u2019 positive performance to 14 consecutive days. In analyzing individual ETF data from this week, the BlackRock IBIT registered $1.31 billion in net deposits solidifying its position as the market\u2019s unrivalled leader. Meanwhile, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and Ark/21 Shares\u2019 ARKB also experienced substantial cumulative inflows of $504.40 million and $268.14 million, respectively. Grayscale\u2019s BTC, VanEck\u2019s HODL, Valkyrie\u2019s BRRR, Invesco\u2019s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton\u2019s EZBC also recorded moderate net flows ranging from $1million &#8211; $25 million. In familiar fashion, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC produced the only net outflows losing $5.69 million in withdrawals, but still retains its position as the third largest Bitcoin ETF with $19.79 billion in net assets. Following this week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now recorded $4.50 billion in net flows in June signaling a resolute demand from institutional investors despite Bitcoin market troubles. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed extensive corrections since hitting a new all-time high of $111,790 on May 22. Over the last month, BTC has made no new price discovery trading largely between $100,000 and $110,000 to form a descending price channel. While this price performance reflects a neutral market sentiment, the high influx of capital into the Bitcoin ETFs signal a long-term confidence by institutional investors on Bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation prospects.

In June alone, these ETFs saw total inflows of $1.13 billion, marking their largest monthly gain in 2025. As of the time of writing, the total net assets of the Ethereum ETFs stand at $9.88 billion, accounting for 3.37% of Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization.

      "summary": "Bitcoin prices climbed by 5.07% in the past week to hit a local peak of $108,000 before experiencing a solid rejection. Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has remained in the $106,000 &#8211; $107,000 range showing no indications of a breakout in either market direction. Amidst this market consolidation, renowned crypto analyst with X username KillaXBT has highlighted the key liquidation zones in the present Bitcoin market structure that are critical to the next significant price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Bitcoin: Clustering At $103K\u2013$106K And $108K\u2013$111K &#8211; What Could This Mean? In a recent X post , KillaXBT shares that Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal decision zone as liquidation heatmap data from Coinglass reveals notable liquidity clusters forming on both ends of the current price range. The market expert explains that BTC is trapped between long and short liquidation zones in both low and high time frames (L/HTF) signaling a moment of market indecision On the 7-day chart (LTF), KillaXBT states there are accumulations of long positions between $103,400 and $106,000. This data suggests that a move below this price range could trigger cascading stop-losses and force liquidations, sending Bitcoin prices lower in a short-term decline. On the other hand, there are also liquidity clusters in the $108,000\u2013$109,000 region, indicating the presence of potentially significant short positions. A breakout above $109,000 could initiate a sharp short squeeze, perhaps driving prices higher toward the current all-time high in the $111,000 price range. Using the 30-day chart (HTF), KillaXBT provides more information on the Bitcoin market stalemate. The analyst notes that more short-side liquidations are clustered between $108,300 and $109,000 than long-side liquidations between $103,000 and $106,000. However, the presence of short positions at $111,000 presents a scenario where bulls could reclaim control if they successfully push past this upper resistance. Ultimately, KillaXBT concludes the current BTC market structure suggests a delicate balance with high-leverage positions stacked both above and below current prices. The market expert warns that traders refrain from engaging the market until the highlighted liquidation zones are tested.

Meanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Sentora reports that Bitcoin&#8217;s weekly network fees totaled $3.39 million, marking a 38.9% decline from the previous week. Despite this drop in on-chain activity, exchange outflows of $310 million suggest a strong market confidence, as investors increasingly move their assets into private wallets, typically a sign of long-term holding intent.
