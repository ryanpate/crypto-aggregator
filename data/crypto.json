      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-could-hit-9-in-euphoric-fifth-wave/",
      "summary": "XRP is inching toward what could be its most consequential technical inflection in more than a year, according to the June 3 video analysis from the YouTube channel More Crypto Online (MCO). Employing classical Elliott-wave mapping, the analyst argues that XRP has been building a five-wave advance ever since the market reset in July 2023 and is now attempting to ignite the terminal \u201cfifth\u201d wave\u2014a rally that, if it unfolds under euphoric conditions, could extend as far as $9. How The Roadmap Is Built For XRP \u201cWe might be in a process of upside reversal\u2026 It\u2019s like a now-or-never moment,\u201d the commentator told viewers, stressing that breakouts are usually obvious only after large portions of the move are already spent. In Elliott wave terminology the market is said to be preparing for a smaller-degree third wave inside the larger fifth, \u201cnormally the most aggressive one,\u201d he noted, pointing to the explosive impulse that followed a similar set-up last year. Related Reading: Analyst: XRP Is Coiled For A Short Squeeze Rally On MCO\u2019s primary chart the July 2023 trough serves as the wave-four low of an even larger advance. From there, a series of lower-degree one-two formations appears to have carried XRP into wave three and, more recently, into a sideways, three-legged correction that completed in April. \u201cWe have a wave 1, a wave 2, a wave 3, the wave 4, and maybe this is now the fifth wave that\u2019s unfolding,\u201d he explained, adding that wave four\u2019s depth and duration were textbook for a counter-trend pause. To translate wave counts into price objectives the analyst measured waves 1 through 3 and projected the classic 61.8 percent Fibonacci extension from the bottom of wave 4. That calculation yields $6.20 as a \u201cstraightforward\u201d fifth-wave target. The same measurement\u2019s 78.6 percent extension sits at roughly $9.00, a level the commentator said \u201csometimes materialises in a very euphoric fifth wave.\u201d Before any discussion of $5-plus prices becomes actionable, XRP must clear a cluster of near-term hurdles. The analyst identifies the $2.30\u2013$2.40 range as the first structural ceiling; it coincides with a descending trend-line that has capped every rally since March and with the 100-day exponential moving average. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $50 If Ripple Gets Bank License, Claims Crypto Pundit The shorter-time-frame wave count shows why this band matters. From the 7 April swing low the market printed a clear five-wave micro-structure, implying that a fresh up-trend may already be underway. Yet, as the analyst cautioned, \u201cWe still have to clear all these previous swing highs\u2026 We\u2019ve got resistance in this area around $2.30, structurally $2.40.\u201d A decisive break above that shelf would validate a sub-wave (iii) target around $3.30\u2013$3.50, the January swing-high zone the video calls \u201cthe next level.\u201d Bearish Scenario For XRP Every Elliott-wave blueprint comes with an invalidation level. In the MCO model the entire fifth-wave scenario survives only if price holds above the April nadir\u2014the start of wave 1 in the current one-two set-up. At the micro level the bulls must also defend what the video labels \u201cthe $1.99 support area.\u201d A deeper retracement to $1.60 (the \u201cred dotted line\u201d) could be tolerated inside an extended wave 2, but any sustained trade beneath that mark would probably mean wave 4 is still developing, pushing back the timetable for a breakout. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re holding above the April low, this pathway higher remains valid and plausible,\u201d the analyst reiterated. Conversely, a failure there would force a re-evaluation of the entire count. Although the headline $9 print grabs attention, the analyst is clear that such an extension presupposes an extreme sentiment shift. Historically XRP\u2019s rallies have often stalled near the 61.8 percent projection, and the channel\u2019s host reminds viewers that \u201cmarket sentiment\u201d ultimately decides whether the 78.6 percent extension is reachable. For now the focus is squarely on securing an impulsive close above $2.40 and then on challenging the mid-$3 region. Only once that campaign succeeds will the discussion move seriously toward $5.65, $6.20 and, in a parabolic climax, the high-single-digit zone. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-52-increase-to-166000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has been gaining strength over the past several days, with price action relaying the buying interest from institutional players. A surge of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs helped push the price to $109,758, followed shortly after by another move to around $110,386 in the past 24 hours. This brings Bitcoin within close proximity to its price peak just above $111,000. Now that momentum is clearly leaning bullish, technical analysis shows a breakout that could see Bitcoin increase by another 52% within the next three months. Fibonacci Extension Model Points To $166,000 Price Target CryptoCon shared a chart based on Fibonacci extensions that places the next major upside target at $166,754. This level corresponds to the 5.618 Fibonacci ratio and marks a projected 52% increase from the current region around $109,000. The analyst highlighted how previous Fibonacci extension levels like $30,362, $46,831, $71,591, and $109,236, have all aligned with important points for Bitcoin&#8217;s price action throughout the ongoing cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes History With Highest Monthly Close, But Volume Is Still Bearish According to CryptoCon, this model has consistently tracked Bitcoin\u2019s moves over the past two years. As shown in the price chart below, the 1.618, 2.618, 3.618, and 4.618 Fibonacci extension levels have all been reached this cycle, with the latest being $109,236 at the 4.618 Fib level. Keeping this in mind, the next Fibonacci extension level is at 5.618, which corresponds to $166,754. The $166,000 mark has remained unchanged as the cycle\u2019s next projection. But although the timing has proven difficult to nail down, the structure of the chart is still intact and continues to validate the target. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is currently sitting just above the 4.618 extension level, and a 52% rally from here would complete the pattern. Revised Timeline Pushes Target To September Although the projection for $166,000 is still consistent, the timeline to reach it has undergone several adjustments. CryptoCon estimates that Bitcoin could reach the $166,000 level by September; however, he also acknowledged that the forecast has shifted several times. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move He explained that the current cycle has taken longer than any previous one, which has caused earlier predictions to be delayed. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin&#8217;s current cycle began in late 2022 after it reached a bottom around $15,000 during the bear market. This means the current bull phase has dragged on for almost three years. Still, data has shown over and over that the cycle is not finished, and so the only thing left to do is to wait. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,110. If the $160,000 price target is eventually reached in September, the next outlook would be a possible move to the 6.618 Fib extension, which is sitting at a price target of $254,162.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-classic-reversal-setup/",
      "summary": "SUI has recently exhibited a classic reversal pattern, forming a well-defined triple-top formation on its price chart. This technical setup often signals a potential shift from bullish to bearish momentum, as repeated attempts to break a resistance level falter. Traders and investors are now closely watching to see if this pattern will trigger a downward correction or if the bulls can regain control. SUI Weakens After Forming Triple Top Near $3.085 Crypto Sat recently stated in a post on X that SUI has just printed a classic Triple Top pattern on the 15-minute chart \u2014 and the outlook is not looking bullish at the moment. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View According to Crypto Sat, the three peaks labeled Top 1, Top 2, and Top 3 are formed near the $3.085 zone, with each successive peak showing less momentum. Now, the price is breaking down below the $2.995 level, which had been acting as the neckline support for this pattern. This breakdown below the neckline support signals that the bullish effort is weakening and opens the door for potential further downside movement. Traders should watch this key level closely as it may set the tone for the next price action. Key Takeaways from Crypto Sat\u2019s Analysis According to Crypto Sat, several key technical signals have emerged on SUI\u2019s chart, reinforcing the bearish implications of the recently formed Triple Top pattern. Pattern Identification: Crypto Sat considers the pattern as a classic indicator of trend exhaustion, where repeated failed attempts to push higher signals weaken bullish pressure. Related Reading: SUI Meteoric Rise: Golden Cross Signals A Potential 380% Explosion Support Breakdown: The drop beneath the $2.995 neckline, which Crypto Sat identifies as a key support, marks a bearish turning point. Next Support Targets: Crypto Sat points to the next important support levels between $2.92 and $2.87, which could act as potential zones for price stabilization or further selling if breached. Volume Confirmation: The breakdown below support occurred alongside an uptick in volume, reinforcing Crypto Sat\u2019s view that downside momentum is gaining strength and the bears have the upper hand for now. In line with Crypto Sat\u2019s analysis, this technical pattern and volume-backed breakdown highlight increased downside risk ahead unless a strong bullish reversal emerges. The analyst further cautioned that if buyers fail to step in promptly, the price may soon retest the $2.85 to $2.87 support zone in the short term. While it is still early in the move, the breakdown structure is clearly in place. Traders should monitor the situation closely for signs of a potential bounce or continued selling pressure.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-forms-rising-wedge-pattern-2200-support-back-in-focus/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading above the $2,500 mark but continues to struggle with strong resistance near $2,600, a key level that has capped further upside in recent sessions. After gaining over 23% since June 22, ETH has shown signs of strength, reclaiming crucial levels and riding the wave of market-wide optimism. However, as the broader crypto market stalls, Ethereum\u2019s momentum appears to be slowing down. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance \u2013 Bulls Target $97.10 Level The bullish impulse that drove ETH higher in late June is now meeting headwinds. Despite holding above important moving averages and maintaining a short-term uptrend, Ethereum has failed to break decisively above the $2,600 barrier. Analysts warn that a failure to reclaim this level with strong volume could lead to a short-term correction. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights indicating a potential bearish setup on the 4-hour chart. According to Runefelt, Ethereum is forming a pattern that could lead to a pullback toward lower demand zones if momentum continues to fade. The coming days will be critical, as bulls attempt to maintain control while bears eye an opportunity to reclaim short-term dominance. Ethereum Faces A Critical Level Ethereum is approaching a crucial juncture following a week marked by volatility and renewed bullish momentum. After reclaiming the $2,500 level and rising over 23% since June 22, ETH has regained the attention of investors. However, the rally now faces a critical test: breaking above the $2,700 resistance level. A successful move above this threshold could ignite a broader altcoin rally, as Ethereum often acts as the leader for the altcoin market. Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with bulls appearing to control short-term price action. Ethereum is trading above key moving averages and remains structurally bullish on higher timeframes. Yet, price has stalled just below the $2,600\u2013$2,700 zone\u2014a key supply area that must be flipped into support to confirm the next upward leg. A clean breakout could propel ETH into a new price range, allowing other altcoins to follow and break above their own resistance levels. Carl Runefelt cautions that Ethereum is currently forming a rising wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart\u2014a potentially bearish setup. If the pattern plays out, ETH could fail to break higher and instead fall back toward lower support zones. Runefelt points to the $2,200 level as a key horizontal support that could be tested if momentum weakens and sellers regain short-term control. For now, Ethereum\u2019s price action remains in a tight range. A decisive breakout or breakdown will likely define the direction of the altcoin market in the weeks ahead. Traders and investors alike are closely watching ETH\u2019s next move, as it could set the tone for the remainder of the summer crypto cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility \u2013 $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum ETH Price Analysis: Key Resistance At $2,600 Ethereum\u2019s price action continues to reflect a tug-of-war between bulls and bears as it hovers around the $2,550 level, just under the critical resistance at $2,600. After reclaiming that level briefly, ETH failed to hold its gains and pulled back slightly, suggesting sellers remain active at this zone. The chart shows Ethereum forming a lower high in the near term, raising short-term caution among traders. The 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages are now converging around $2,500\u2013$2,530, acting as immediate support. As long as ETH holds above these levels, the medium-term outlook remains constructive. However, any sustained drop below these moving averages could invite additional downside pressure, possibly dragging the price back toward the $2,400 range or even testing the 200-day SMA near $2,180. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounces Off Key Demand Level \u2013 Price Discovery On The Menu? Volume has remained moderate, showing that neither side has taken full control. Until ETH decisively breaks above $2,600 and flips it into support, the uptrend remains unconfirmed. The next key resistance sits at $2,700. Conversely, a rejection from current levels could indicate the formation of a range-bound structure or a rising wedge breakdown, as some analysts like Carl Runefelt suggest.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrps-30-jump-to-2-8/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst CasiTrades has predicted that the XRP price could record a 30% rally to $2.8. She further revealed what the altcoin needs to do first to gain momentum to reach this level, which could pave the way to new highs. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $2.8 With This Classic Confirmation In an X post, CasiTrades shared an accompanying chart that showed that the XRP price could soon rally to as high as $2.8. The analyst indicated that the $2.25 support zone will decide the altcoin\u2019s next move. She said that she is looking for that classic confirmation, whereby XRP breaks $2.25 and then comes back to test it as support. Related Reading: XRP Price: Here\u2019s What Has Been Driving The Calls For 1,000% CasiTrades remarked that the flip of $2.25 as support could be fast, signaling that the market is ready for continuation. She predicts that the flip of $2.25 could open the door to $2.69. The analyst added that it is possible that the XRP price trends closer towards $2.69. This could be near $2.45, with a final exhausted high at the resistance fib. Based on her accompanying chart, a rally to $2.8 could also be in play. Commenting on the current XRP price action, the analyst stated that the XRP price continues to respect the 0.382 retracement, which she claimed is the exact apex of the consolidation. She further remarked that every reaction at this current level reinforces how significant the range is. CasiTrades added that the test and bounce off the top of the upper trendline indicates that the market is gearing up for another run at the $2.25 resistance. She also said that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) will be crucial at each of these resistance prices to monitor exhaustion or strength. However, the analyst is confident that the bullish structure is still valid for the XRP price. The altcoin simply needs to hold the 0.382 retracement level, flip $2.25, and then it can rally to the upside. Short-Term Targets For The Altcoin In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto outlined the short-term targets for the XRP price. He stated that a close above $2.35 would be bullish for the altcoin. Meanwhile, a close above $2.42 would be super bullish for XRP. A close above these targets would also be significant as it would mean that the altcoin has flipped the $2.25 resistance, which CasiTrades highlighted. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 In the long term, the crypto analyst is confident that the XRP price can reach double digits. He recently predicted that the altcoin could reach between $9.5 and $37.5 in this market cycle. He alluded to historical cycles as the reason XRP could reach these targets. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.24, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
