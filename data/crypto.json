      "summary": "Dogecoin appears to be in the midst of a quiet accumulation phase, with a technical setup that may soon shift market sentiment. As highlighted by Crypto Man MAB, a double bottom pattern is taking shape on the weekly chart \u2014 a structure often associated with strong trend reversals. Structure Aligns With Sentiment: Is Dogecoin Poised For A Comeback? According to Crypto Man MAB in a recent post on X, Dogecoin appears to be setting the stage for a potential upward move, with a classic double-bottom pattern taking shape on the weekly chart. This pattern, often seen as a signal of a bullish reversal, has caught the attention of traders who are closely watching for confirmation. The current chart structure suggests that Dogecoin could be gearing up for a significant trend shift, provided the conditions align in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Spot Dogecoin ETF Gains SEC Traction\u2014Is A Price Surge Next? At the center of this formation is the key support level at $0.142, which Crypto Man MAB emphasized as being critical to the potential breakout. This level was previously tested and held by bulls back in April 2025, demonstrating its strength as a defensive zone. If the support holds and bullish momentum continues to build, Crypto Man MAB pointed out that the next major focus will be on the neckline resistance around $0.26. A successful breakout above this point could validate the double-bottom pattern and open the door for a rally toward the $0.47 target. Downtrend Fatigue Sets In\u2014Will The Bulls Take Over? Crypto Man MAB further noted that the ADX indicator, which is currently trending downward, signals a weakening of the recent downtrend from the neckline resistance. A slowdown in trend strength often precedes a shift in direction, and in this case, it supports the idea that Dogecoin could be preparing for a reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sets The Stage For A Liftoff With Key Reversal Pattern At the same time, attention has turned to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is hovering just below the neutral 50 level. While there are signs of increased buying interest, the RSI has yet to cross into bullish territory. Crypto Man MAB indicated that a decisive move above the 50 mark would significantly reinforce the bullish scenario, increasing the likelihood of a sustained rally. Until then, some sideways consolidation around the $0.142 support level remains possible. In conclusion, Crypto Man MAB believes Dogecoin is at a critical juncture, buoyed by market optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF. With both retail traders and larger investors (whales) accumulating at these levels, the stage is set for a possible breakout. Should current technical conditions improve and sentiment remain favorable, the path toward the $0.47 target could soon come into focus. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

He argues that expectations of an extended consolidation in Bitcoin, based on the fractals and market behavior seen in 2023 and early 2024, fail to account for a critical factor: 2025 is a post-halving year.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-coinbase-premium-positive-seven-weeks/",
      "summary": "The cryptocurrency market \u2014 specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 has performed quite well in the second quarter of 2025, which is a stark contrast to the first quarter&#8217;s performance. The premier cryptocurrency capitalized on this bullish momentum, jumping to a new all-time high above the $111,000 mark. Similarly, the price of Ethereum started its own resurgence and reclaimed the $2,000 mark in early May, albeit the altcoin has been stuck in a consolidation range over the past month. Despite the brewing market uncertainty due to the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to stay afloat. US Investors Keep Crypto Prices Afloat In a new post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that United States investors have been active in the market over the past few weeks. The crypto analyst explained that this correlates with the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices withstanding bearish pressure in recent weeks. Related Reading: You Won\u2019t Believe Who\u2019s Moving Millions in Bitcoin on Binance Right Now This on-chain observation is based on the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks the difference between the crypto prices on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and global Binance exchange (USDT pair). This metric reflects the sentiment of the US institutional entities (the major players on Coinbase) compared to those on global exchanges. Typically, when the price premium on Coinbase has a positive value, it implies increasing demand from US investors, who are willing to spend more than other global investors to buy cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum, in this case). On the flip side, the Coinbase Premium Index falling beneath the zero mark signals that US investors are buying less compared to the global traders. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index (excluding the abrupt dip in BTC on May 29) has been in the positive territory since May 9, 2024. This 47-day streak suggests high buying activity from US institutional investors despite geopolitical tensions. Kesmeci added: In the U.S., institutional investors and Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum ETF investors (except for Fidelity) continue their heavy purchases through Coinbase (and have been for weeks). This is why Coinbase Premiums are showing strong positive momentum. Because of this (in my opinion), despite the crises, we haven\u2019t seen a sharp drop in Bitcoin or Ethereum in the market. In essence, the on-chain analyst believes the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have been able to weather the storm with the rising tensions in Asia because US investors have been active in the market. Naturally, risk assets tend to succumb to bearish pressure during unstable conditions like wars, global pandemics, and so on. Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Price As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,100, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Ether token is valued at around $2,420, with a mere 0.6% price jump in the past day.

      "summary": "Amidst a widespread uncertainty in the crypto market, SUI is undergoing a major price correction as evidenced by 23.25% loss in the past 30 days. During this period, the popular altcoin and a major headliner in the present market cycle has traded as low as $2.35, which is a 56.44% decline from its all-time high of $5.35 in January. Amidst this mayhem, prominent market expert with X pseudonym PlanD has stated the ongoing formation of a bullish dual pattern hints at an incoming explosive price gain in the SUI market. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,500 In Squeeze-Driven Rally \u2013 But Can It Hold? Technical Combo Sets Stage for SUI Surge &#8211; Analyst In an X post on June 27, PlanD shares an interesting price analysis that reveals the formation of two bullish patterns &#8211; the bull pennant and the inverse head and shoulder (H&#38;S) &#8211; on the SUI daily chart. Both patterns currently form a confluence of technical indicators suggesting the altcoin is preparing for a major price rally as the second half of 2025 approaches. The inverse head and shoulder pattern is a common bullish reversal pattern. Amidst SUI\u2019s price correction in Q1, the altcoin formed the left shoulder at $2.42 in February and head at $1.74 in April with a recent price bounce off $2.62 appearing to form the right shoulder. PlanD describes $2.62 as a critical support level in this bullish set-up, the validity of which ensures a potential price breakout. In studying PlanD\u2019s technical analysis, the inverse H&#38;S currently has a neckline of $4.25, breaking past which confirms the bullish price reversal with a price target set at $10.74. &#160; Meanwhile, The bull pennant is a common chart pattern marked by a strong price uptrend (flagpole), followed by a descending channel (pennant) that precedes a price breakout similar to the length of the flagpole. Based on the analysis presented by PlanD, prior bull pennants on the SUI chart have successfully resulted in explosive rallies as seen in 2023 and 2024. Notably, SUI bullish price action from mid 2024 to its ATH in January followed by a descending price movement since then represents the latest bull pennant. Based on the initial price surge (flagpole), PlanD presents a SUI long-term price target of $27, representing a potentially 10x gain on current market prices.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-woes-to-continue-analyst-expects-ada/",
      "summary": "The Cardano price performance has been nothing short of shambolic since the start of May, falling from the lofty heights of $0.85 in less than two months. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin\u2019s value has declined by more than 24% in the past month. While the price of ADA saw an explosive growth at the beginning of the second quarter, the token is now back where it started in April \u2014 just above the $0.5 mark. Interestingly, the signs are pointing to further decline for the Cardano price over the next few weeks. ADA Price Stuck In Descending Channel On Friday, June 27, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez took to the social media platform X to share an ominous prediction for the ADA token\u2019s price. According to the crypto pundit, the Cardano price could be heading to around $0.47 for its next support. Related Reading: Ethereum\u2019s Network Is Heating Up While Price Stalls, Is a Breakout Coming? This bearish projection revolves around the appearance of a descending channel pattern on the three-day Cardano chart. A descending channel is a chart formation in technical analysis characterized by two major trendlines: the upper line acting as the resistance level and the lower line acting as the support level. The space between these trendlines serves as the channel within which prices move over a period. Typically, the formation of a descending channel suggests the persistence of a downward price trend and lower highs. At the same time, traders can use this pattern to identify optimal entry and exit points. The Cardano price chart above, for instance, shows that the altcoin price has been in a downward trend since last November. The token seemed to have turned its fortune around after finding support at the lower trendline in early April and running back above the $0.8 level. However, the Cardano price failed to break the upper trendline at the beginning of May and has since been experiencing a downturn. According to Martinez, the ADA token could fall to as low as $0.47 \u2014 around the lower trendline \u2014 to find a support cushion. Moreover, the 1.272 Fibonacci level \u2014 used in technical analysis to identify price targets and support or resistance levels \u2014 is also around the lower trendline. Ultimately, this means that the Cardano price could fall even lower than its current price point. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the ADA token is valued at around $0.56, reflecting a 1.3% price jump in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the price of Cardano is down by more than 3% in the last seven days.
