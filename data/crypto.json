      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-52-increase-to-166000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has been gaining strength over the past several days, with price action relaying the buying interest from institutional players. A surge of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs helped push the price to $109,758, followed shortly after by another move to around $110,386 in the past 24 hours. This brings Bitcoin within close proximity to its price peak just above $111,000. Now that momentum is clearly leaning bullish, technical analysis shows a breakout that could see Bitcoin increase by another 52% within the next three months. Fibonacci Extension Model Points To $166,000 Price Target CryptoCon shared a chart based on Fibonacci extensions that places the next major upside target at $166,754. This level corresponds to the 5.618 Fibonacci ratio and marks a projected 52% increase from the current region around $109,000. The analyst highlighted how previous Fibonacci extension levels like $30,362, $46,831, $71,591, and $109,236, have all aligned with important points for Bitcoin&#8217;s price action throughout the ongoing cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes History With Highest Monthly Close, But Volume Is Still Bearish According to CryptoCon, this model has consistently tracked Bitcoin\u2019s moves over the past two years. As shown in the price chart below, the 1.618, 2.618, 3.618, and 4.618 Fibonacci extension levels have all been reached this cycle, with the latest being $109,236 at the 4.618 Fib level. Keeping this in mind, the next Fibonacci extension level is at 5.618, which corresponds to $166,754. The $166,000 mark has remained unchanged as the cycle\u2019s next projection. But although the timing has proven difficult to nail down, the structure of the chart is still intact and continues to validate the target. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is currently sitting just above the 4.618 extension level, and a 52% rally from here would complete the pattern. Revised Timeline Pushes Target To September Although the projection for $166,000 is still consistent, the timeline to reach it has undergone several adjustments. CryptoCon estimates that Bitcoin could reach the $166,000 level by September; however, he also acknowledged that the forecast has shifted several times. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move He explained that the current cycle has taken longer than any previous one, which has caused earlier predictions to be delayed. To put this in perspective, Bitcoin&#8217;s current cycle began in late 2022 after it reached a bottom around $15,000 during the bear market. This means the current bull phase has dragged on for almost three years. Still, data has shown over and over that the cycle is not finished, and so the only thing left to do is to wait. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,110. If the $160,000 price target is eventually reached in September, the next outlook would be a possible move to the 6.618 Fib extension, which is sitting at a price target of $254,162.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-classic-reversal-setup/",
      "summary": "SUI has recently exhibited a classic reversal pattern, forming a well-defined triple-top formation on its price chart. This technical setup often signals a potential shift from bullish to bearish momentum, as repeated attempts to break a resistance level falter. Traders and investors are now closely watching to see if this pattern will trigger a downward correction or if the bulls can regain control. SUI Weakens After Forming Triple Top Near $3.085 Crypto Sat recently stated in a post on X that SUI has just printed a classic Triple Top pattern on the 15-minute chart \u2014 and the outlook is not looking bullish at the moment. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View According to Crypto Sat, the three peaks labeled Top 1, Top 2, and Top 3 are formed near the $3.085 zone, with each successive peak showing less momentum. Now, the price is breaking down below the $2.995 level, which had been acting as the neckline support for this pattern. This breakdown below the neckline support signals that the bullish effort is weakening and opens the door for potential further downside movement. Traders should watch this key level closely as it may set the tone for the next price action. Key Takeaways from Crypto Sat\u2019s Analysis According to Crypto Sat, several key technical signals have emerged on SUI\u2019s chart, reinforcing the bearish implications of the recently formed Triple Top pattern. Pattern Identification: Crypto Sat considers the pattern as a classic indicator of trend exhaustion, where repeated failed attempts to push higher signals weaken bullish pressure. Related Reading: SUI Meteoric Rise: Golden Cross Signals A Potential 380% Explosion Support Breakdown: The drop beneath the $2.995 neckline, which Crypto Sat identifies as a key support, marks a bearish turning point. Next Support Targets: Crypto Sat points to the next important support levels between $2.92 and $2.87, which could act as potential zones for price stabilization or further selling if breached. Volume Confirmation: The breakdown below support occurred alongside an uptick in volume, reinforcing Crypto Sat\u2019s view that downside momentum is gaining strength and the bears have the upper hand for now. In line with Crypto Sat\u2019s analysis, this technical pattern and volume-backed breakdown highlight increased downside risk ahead unless a strong bullish reversal emerges. The analyst further cautioned that if buyers fail to step in promptly, the price may soon retest the $2.85 to $2.87 support zone in the short term. While it is still early in the move, the breakdown structure is clearly in place. Traders should monitor the situation closely for signs of a potential bounce or continued selling pressure.

      "summary": "Ethereum is trading above the $2,500 mark but continues to struggle with strong resistance near $2,600, a key level that has capped further upside in recent sessions. After gaining over 23% since June 22, ETH has shown signs of strength, reclaiming crucial levels and riding the wave of market-wide optimism. However, as the broader crypto market stalls, Ethereum\u2019s momentum appears to be slowing down. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance \u2013 Bulls Target $97.10 Level The bullish impulse that drove ETH higher in late June is now meeting headwinds. Despite holding above important moving averages and maintaining a short-term uptrend, Ethereum has failed to break decisively above the $2,600 barrier. Analysts warn that a failure to reclaim this level with strong volume could lead to a short-term correction. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights indicating a potential bearish setup on the 4-hour chart. According to Runefelt, Ethereum is forming a pattern that could lead to a pullback toward lower demand zones if momentum continues to fade. The coming days will be critical, as bulls attempt to maintain control while bears eye an opportunity to reclaim short-term dominance. Ethereum Faces A Critical Level Ethereum is approaching a crucial juncture following a week marked by volatility and renewed bullish momentum. After reclaiming the $2,500 level and rising over 23% since June 22, ETH has regained the attention of investors. However, the rally now faces a critical test: breaking above the $2,700 resistance level. A successful move above this threshold could ignite a broader altcoin rally, as Ethereum often acts as the leader for the altcoin market. Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with bulls appearing to control short-term price action. Ethereum is trading above key moving averages and remains structurally bullish on higher timeframes. Yet, price has stalled just below the $2,600\u2013$2,700 zone\u2014a key supply area that must be flipped into support to confirm the next upward leg. A clean breakout could propel ETH into a new price range, allowing other altcoins to follow and break above their own resistance levels. Carl Runefelt cautions that Ethereum is currently forming a rising wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart\u2014a potentially bearish setup. If the pattern plays out, ETH could fail to break higher and instead fall back toward lower support zones. Runefelt points to the $2,200 level as a key horizontal support that could be tested if momentum weakens and sellers regain short-term control. For now, Ethereum\u2019s price action remains in a tight range. A decisive breakout or breakdown will likely define the direction of the altcoin market in the weeks ahead. Traders and investors alike are closely watching ETH\u2019s next move, as it could set the tone for the remainder of the summer crypto cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility \u2013 $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum ETH Price Analysis: Key Resistance At $2,600 Ethereum\u2019s price action continues to reflect a tug-of-war between bulls and bears as it hovers around the $2,550 level, just under the critical resistance at $2,600. After reclaiming that level briefly, ETH failed to hold its gains and pulled back slightly, suggesting sellers remain active at this zone. The chart shows Ethereum forming a lower high in the near term, raising short-term caution among traders. The 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages are now converging around $2,500\u2013$2,530, acting as immediate support. As long as ETH holds above these levels, the medium-term outlook remains constructive. However, any sustained drop below these moving averages could invite additional downside pressure, possibly dragging the price back toward the $2,400 range or even testing the 200-day SMA near $2,180. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounces Off Key Demand Level \u2013 Price Discovery On The Menu? Volume has remained moderate, showing that neither side has taken full control. Until ETH decisively breaks above $2,600 and flips it into support, the uptrend remains unconfirmed. The next key resistance sits at $2,700. Conversely, a rejection from current levels could indicate the formation of a range-bound structure or a rising wedge breakdown, as some analysts like Carl Runefelt suggest.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrps-30-jump-to-2-8/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst CasiTrades has predicted that the XRP price could record a 30% rally to $2.8. She further revealed what the altcoin needs to do first to gain momentum to reach this level, which could pave the way to new highs. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $2.8 With This Classic Confirmation In an X post, CasiTrades shared an accompanying chart that showed that the XRP price could soon rally to as high as $2.8. The analyst indicated that the $2.25 support zone will decide the altcoin\u2019s next move. She said that she is looking for that classic confirmation, whereby XRP breaks $2.25 and then comes back to test it as support. Related Reading: XRP Price: Here\u2019s What Has Been Driving The Calls For 1,000% CasiTrades remarked that the flip of $2.25 as support could be fast, signaling that the market is ready for continuation. She predicts that the flip of $2.25 could open the door to $2.69. The analyst added that it is possible that the XRP price trends closer towards $2.69. This could be near $2.45, with a final exhausted high at the resistance fib. Based on her accompanying chart, a rally to $2.8 could also be in play. Commenting on the current XRP price action, the analyst stated that the XRP price continues to respect the 0.382 retracement, which she claimed is the exact apex of the consolidation. She further remarked that every reaction at this current level reinforces how significant the range is. CasiTrades added that the test and bounce off the top of the upper trendline indicates that the market is gearing up for another run at the $2.25 resistance. She also said that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) will be crucial at each of these resistance prices to monitor exhaustion or strength. However, the analyst is confident that the bullish structure is still valid for the XRP price. The altcoin simply needs to hold the 0.382 retracement level, flip $2.25, and then it can rally to the upside. Short-Term Targets For The Altcoin In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto outlined the short-term targets for the XRP price. He stated that a close above $2.35 would be bullish for the altcoin. Meanwhile, a close above $2.42 would be super bullish for XRP. A close above these targets would also be significant as it would mean that the altcoin has flipped the $2.25 resistance, which CasiTrades highlighted. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 In the long term, the crypto analyst is confident that the XRP price can reach double digits.

At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.24, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-breakout-trap-pain-before-160000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin may be breaking out\u2014but don\u2019t celebrate yet. Crypto analyst Cristian Chifoi warns that the current move is a deceptive setup likely to trap bullish traders before Bitcoin eventually surges toward $160,000. In his latest YouTube video titled \u201cBitcoin is breaking out! But why is it bad?\u201d, Chifoi dismantles the optimism surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action, arguing that this rally is not the start of a true bull run, but a temporary fakeout designed to mislead. Don\u2019t Trust The Bitcoin Pump \u201cFrom a technical standpoint, this could mean a real breakout, retest, and then continuation,\u201d Chifoi admits. \u201cBut in my opinion, this is a false breakout which can get to a new shallow all-time high, maybe $113,000, maybe $120,000 until something like July 10 to 12\u2014then we come back in this channel before July 20.\u201d His thesis hinges on Bitcoin seasonality, a pattern he has explored in earlier videos, which suggests the real macro pivot will only arrive later in the month. \u201cI&#8217;m more bullish from July 20 into the start of September,\u201d he says. Related Reading: Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report Chifoi argues that retail traders are likely to pile in during the breakout retest phase, only to be shaken out as market makers use the liquidity to reverse the trend. \u201cThe majority of retail traders would go long here on a retest. The market makers will get their money,\u201d he warns, predicting a trap that could drag Bitcoin down to levels near $97,000 before the real uptrend resumes. His analysis extends beyond simple technicals. Chifoi points to macroeconomic sentiment and Fed policy as crucial context, particularly emphasizing that rate cuts would actually be a bearish signal\u2014not bullish as commonly believed. \u201cRate cuts this year would not be bullish at all,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s not Powell who decides, it\u2019s the bond market who decides when the rate cuts should come\u2026 and when that is happening, it\u2019s because they need to panic cut.\u201d Chifoi stresses that the best-case scenario for bulls is actually no rate cuts, at least for now. \u201cJust keep the rates at 4.5% maybe until year end. If this happens, I\u2019m 100% sure that the market will go higher and higher before this starts to happen.\u201d Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin Before Jackson Hole\u2014Or Regret It Forever, Says Arthur Hayes Beyond Bitcoin, Chifoi forecasts a synchronized move across the broader crypto market once the July 20 pivot takes place. He highlights Ethereum, XRP, DeFi tokens like CRV, and ISO-compliant coins such as IOTA, ADA, and Quant as potential beneficiaries. \u201cBitcoin would drag all the crypto space with it,\u201d he says, adding that older players like Filecoin and Polkadot could also catch a bid. Mid-Term Price Target Looking further ahead, Chifoi describes the coming period as a \u201cstablecoin super cycle,\u201d with DeFi projects and yield-generating protocols positioned to gain the most from Wall Street\u2019s hunger for yield. \u201cIn crypto, only DeFi projects get you yields,\u201d he explains. \u201cWall Street is boiling up for yields.\u201d He also reaffirms his macro thesis that the current financial system is on track to be replaced, likening the transition to the 1930s move from gold to fiat. \u201cAfter 100 years of this exact system, this should be replaced by another system with liquidity in it,\u201d he says, envisioning a cryptographic banking future. Despite the short-term turbulence he expects, Chifoi remains long-term bullish. His price target of $160,000 for Bitcoin by early September reflects a belief in accelerated expansion\u2014fueled by seasonality, delayed policy pivots, and broader adoption. In closing, Chifoi reminds his audience to zoom out and trust the high time frame signals. Referencing Bollinger Bands on the two-month chart, he notes the beginning of another expansion phase similar to late 2020. \u201cAfter that, the bear market begins,\u201d he cautions. But until then, the ride could be fast\u2014and extremely volatile. \u201cThe next time we cut [rates], it is a big deal and something is wrong,\u201d he concludes. \u201cFor now, we just want the cuts going higher for longer.\u201d At press time, BTC traded at $108,848.
