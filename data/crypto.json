      "summary": "According to CNBC, corporate treasuries around the globe have surpassed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions for three consecutive quarters. This indicates a growing interest among public companies to adopt strategies similar to those pioneered by Strategy, especially in a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Bitcoin Holdings Surge Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that public companies acquired approximately 131,000 Bitcoin in the second quarter of the year, marking an 18% increase in their BTC holdings. In contrast, exchange-traded funds managed to secure about 111,000 Bitcoin, representing an 8% growth during the same period. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup \u2013 Here\u2019s Why BTC Holds The Key Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, emphasized that the motivations behind these purchases differ significantly. While institutional buyers utilizing ETFs seek exposure to BTC for a variety of reasons, Marie asserted that public companies are primarily focused on accumulating Bitcoin to enhance shareholder value. The market dynamics have also shown that public company BTC holdings increased by 4% in April, a month marked by significant volatility following President Trump\u2019s announcement of initial tariffs. During the same time frame, ETF holdings rose by only 2%. Marie noted that public companies are less concerned with Bitcoin&#8217;s current market price, prioritizing the growth of their Bitcoin reserves to appear more attractive to potential investors. ETFs Still Dominate In This Key Metric Despite the increasing activity from public companies, Bitcoin ETFs remain the largest holders of the cryptocurrency, collectively holding over 1.4 million BTC, or about 6.8% of the total capped supply of 21 million coins. Public companies, on the other hand, hold around 855,000 Bitcoin, approximately 4% of the total supply. The recent surge in corporate BTC accumulation is also a reflection of significant regulatory changes favoring the crypto industry. The last time ETFs outperformed public companies in Bitcoin purchases was during the third quarter of 2024, prior to Trump&#8217;s re-election. Several notable companies have entered the Bitcoin market recently. GameStop began acquiring Bitcoin after its board approved it as a treasury reserve asset earlier this year. Similarly, health-care firm KindlyMD merged with Nakamoto, a Bitcoin investment company, while investor Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s ProCap launched its own BTC purchasing initiative and plans to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Direct Exposure May Ease Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, continues to lead the charge in the Bitcoin treasury space with approximately 597,000 Bitcoin in its possession. Following closely is Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings, which holds nearly 50,000 coins. Ben Werkman, chief investment officer at Swan BTC, remarked on the challenges smaller firms face in trying to match Strategy&#8217;s scale. He predicted that institutional capital will continue to gravitate toward Strategy due to its deep liquidity and established presence. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury Looking ahead, Marie suggested that the number of companies adhering to a BTC treasury strategy may dwindle over the next decade as the market matures. He noted that as more firms enter the space, the individual impact of each company will likely diminish. Additionally, as Bitcoin becomes more normalized, investor constraints regarding direct exposure may fade. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, long\u2011term Bitcoin holders are sitting on unrealized gains last seen during the October 2024 market dip. Right now, those holders show an average profit of 220% on coins they bought and held for the long run. That figure is surprisingly low given Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge back above $107,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming Lower Profit Levels Than Previous Peaks Darkfost used the MVRV ratio \u2014 market value relative to the average cost paid by long\u2011term holders \u2014 to track these shifts. In March 2024, when Bitcoin pushed up to $74,500, MVRV hit 300%. Then in December 2024, at the $108,000 peak, it climbed to 350%. By contrast, today\u2019s 220% gain reflects the fact that many long\u2011term holders bought in at much higher levels than earlier in the cycle. Price Needs To Rise To Match Past Gains Based on an average cost basis of $33,800, Bitcoin would need to climb back to $135,200 just to restore that 300% profit level. If the market aimed to hit the 357% mark again, prices would have to reach roughly $154,400. Both figures track with what history tells us about investor behavior \u2014 people tend to sell when profits hit big round numbers. \ud83d\udcc9 Unrealized profits of LTH continue to decline and are now approaching levels last seen during the October 2024 correction.

In December 2017, at the $19,500 top, long\u2011term holders saw unrealized profits of 4,000%. Then during the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin spiked to $63,000 in April 2021 and MVRV topped out at 1,230%. By November 2021, prices hit about $68,400 but unrealized gains for long\u2011term holders had already fallen to 340%. An analyst&#8217;s recent outlook lines up with this math, first pegging a cycle top at $135,000 in October 2024. After reviewing new data in May 2025, they revised the target range to $120,000\u2013$150,000 and suggested a likely peak between August and September 2025. That range overlaps with the price levels needed to bring MVRV back to earlier highs. Room For More Upside, But Watch The Risks Based on latest figures, Bitcoin is trading at $106,750, roughly flat over the last 24 hours. Lower profit margins mean fewer long\u2011term holders are itching to sell right now, which could leave more fuel for higher prices. Still, on\u2011chain numbers don\u2019t capture the whole picture. Spot-market flows, ETF moves and wider economic shifts can all trigger sharp reversals. Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful?

      "summary": "Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is on track to report an impressive $14 billion in unrealized gains from its extensive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Co-founded by Michael Saylor, the company has successfully transformed itself from a struggling enterprise software provider into a leading leveraged Bitcoin proxy, drawing comparisons to major corporate powerhouses such as Amazon and JPMorgan Chase. Strategy Set To Post Record Profits According to a recent Bloomberg report, Strategy&#8217;s anticipated profits stem largely from the rebound in Bitcoin prices and recent changes in accounting practices that allow the firm to value its substantial cryptocurrency holdings at market rates. Analysts project that while Strategy&#8217;s software business may only generate approximately $112.8 million in revenue for the second quarter, the surge in Bitcoin prices has significantly bolstered its financial outlook. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury This potential record profit comes after a turbulent period for the company, which faced criticism from notable investors like Jim Chanos. Chanos has publicly derided Saylor&#8217;s valuation model, describing it as &#8220;financial gibberish,&#8221; while Saylor has countered that Chanos fails to grasp the intricacies of his approach. Despite the skepticism, Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Capital, noted Saylor&#8217;s resilience, stating that he has consistently outperformed not only his critics but also the broader market. Since Saylor initiated his Bitcoin buying spree, Strategy\u2019s stock has skyrocketed over 3,300%. In the same time frame, Bitcoin has appreciated approximately 1,000%, while the S&#38;P 500 has advanced around 115%. The company&#8217;s shares saw a 40% increase in the second quarter, significantly outpacing the S&#38;P&#8217;s 11% rise. $64 Billion Bitcoin Value The recent accounting change at Strategy, which took effect in the first quarter, allows the firm to recognize the market value of its Bitcoin holdings\u2014currently valued at about $64 billion\u2014resulting in substantial swings in reported earnings. Previously, the company treated its Bitcoin similar to intangible assets, which limited their ability to recognize gains unless the assets were sold. This change has positioned Strategy to capture the full benefit of Bitcoin&#8217;s price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase At the start of the second quarter, Strategy held 528,185 BTC, valued at over $43.5 billion based on market prices. An increase in the value of Bitcoin of 30% during the quarter alone contributed more than $13 billion to the company&#8217;s unrealized gains. Cumulatively, weekly purchases have brought the company closer to holding 600,000 BTC. Despite the positive outlook, the company has faced legal challenges, including several class-action lawsuits claiming that executives misled shareholders regarding the first-quarter losses. In response, Strategy has pledged to vigorously defend against these accusations. As of press time, BTC trades at $106,100, down 5% from its current record high of $111,800 during May\u2019s rally.

      "title": "Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-seasonality-summer-2025/",
      "summary": "A growing number of Bitcoin and crypto market participants have fallen victim to a dangerous assumption: that summer in the crypto markets is synonymous with stagnation. However, crypto analyst Cristian Chifoi warns that this summer may follow a drastically different script. In a video analysis released on July 1, Chifoi lays out a compelling case that 2025 fits a historical pattern that has previously delivered some of Bitcoin\u2019s strongest summer performances. Summer 2025 Could Flip Bitcoin\u2019s Script Chifoi\u2019s thesis is based on a concept he has long explored: Bitcoin seasonality\u2014a recurring, cyclical behavior in Bitcoin\u2019s price action across the calendar year, especially in relation to the four-year halving cycles. According to Chifoi, there is an identifiable seasonal window from mid-January to mid-March where Bitcoin historically shows explosive movement in one direction, only to reverse course in the subsequent months. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm\u2014Bitcoin Could Explode Soon This pattern has held across multiple years and cycles. In 2021, for example, Bitcoin rallied from $28,000 to $60,000 between January and March before collapsing back to $28,000 by summer. The opposite occurred in 2023, when Bitcoin dumped in Q1 and reversed upwards during summer. \u201cFrom January 22nd to March 11th [2024], we had a 2x on Bitcoin,\u201d Chifoi noted. \u201cAnd if the price moves in one direction in this window, it tends to do the exact opposite after that. That\u2019s the seasonality reversal.\u201d Chifoi highlighted this tendency across previous cycles as well, identifying the same trend flip in 2022, 2023, and most notably in 2021. Critically, Chifoi warns that while most traders are anchored to the recent past\u2014recalling three consecutive \u201cboring\u201d summers\u2014this year is historically aligned with a different kind of setup. \u201cNobody is prepared for this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause people only look at the past three years. But those were not the years to look at.\u201d Instead, Chifoi compares 2025 to three historical analogues: 2013, 2017, and 2021\u2014all years that followed a halving and saw significant summer rallies. In each of those years, after early-year volatility or corrections, Bitcoin posted dramatic gains from mid-July into early September. In 2017, Bitcoin rallied 160% in that timeframe. In 2021, the move was 77%. \u201cThe common factor in those years? They were one year after a halving, with a post-March reversal in trend,\u201d Chifoi explained. \u201cNow we are in the same window again. And people are not looking at it.\u201d First Crash, Then Surge? The analyst also emphasized that current price action fits his broader fractal thesis. After Bitcoin\u2019s local top at $109K earlier this year and the rejection that followed, the market appears to be chopping sideways\u2014something he predicted back in late 2024. He expects this phase to continue into July 20, potentially ending with a sudden flush to the downside. But this, he argues, would be the setup for the next leg higher. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if the drop comes with a lot of bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a dump before a rally, the media has a narrative ready. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s real. It just means the market is doing what it always does\u2014shake out the majority.\u201d Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 \u2014 Details Chifoi also addressed broader market confluences, notably pointing out similar behavior in the S&#38;P 500, where a corrective move in early July appears to align with his crypto timing model. He expects a pullback in both markets to precede the next upward thrust, targeting a Fibonacci resistance zone that historically acts as a pause point during price discovery. Despite his bullishness, Chifoi made it clear he\u2019s not buying Bitcoin right now. \u201cI already bought below $20K,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m watching altcoin charts, looking for pullbacks to accumulate.\u201d He expressed frustration at the prevailing narratives circulating among large X accounts, particularly those pushing for rotating altcoins into Bitcoin under the assumption that dominance will rise indefinitely. \u201cThis is very stupid,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cThe market is behaving exactly as it should\u2014for the fewest number of people to make money.\u201d In closing, Chifoi cautioned that those who insist on saying this time is different will likely find themselves on the wrong side of the trade. \u201cOnly if this time is different will this not play out. But if you base your strategy on those words, I can guarantee you 99% of the time, you won\u2019t make money.\u201d As the July 20 pivot approaches, Chifoi\u2019s analysis suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s next move may catch a complacent market off guard. Whether or not history rhymes once more, the veteran analyst has made his stance clear: this is not a summer to sleep through. At press time, BTC traded at $106,880.

      "summary": "June was a strong month for the crypto and Web3 sectors, with related startups successfully raising a collective $1.15B across 140 deals. This represents a 3% increase in raised capital and a 9% increase in the number of deals compared to May, according to crypto market intelligence firm, Messari. The upward trend highlights growing confidence among angel investors in the potential of decentralized technologies. Big winners this round include Kalshi, a predictions market, which secured an $185M round, and Digital Asset, which raised $135M to develop its Canton blockchain. Private token sales also saw a resurgence, with World Liberty Finance bringing in $100M and Eigen Labs securing $70M. These figures paint a vibrant and expanding picture of growth and innovation within the crypto industry. Key Innovations Driving Investor Confidence Diving beyond the figures, the nature of the startups points to a focus on innovative and foundational technologies. Crypto startup, Zama FHE, for example, successfully closed a $57M Series B round, achieving a $1B valuation for its fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technology. Investments in privacy solutions show a growing recognition of the importance of secure and scalable infrastructure for the future of Web3.

If that wasn\u2019t enough, $BTCBULL has a deflationary model implemented through milestone token burns. At specific $BTC price thresholds, a portion of the $BTCBULL supply is permanently removed from circulation, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially the value of the remaining tokens. If you&#8217;re looking for a passive-income vehicle, the $BTCBULL presale offers attractive staking rewards with competitive APYs available (currently 52%). However, you need to get in fast, as the presale ends on July 7. Looking ahead, the multi-faceted rewards system should incentivize long-term holding and engagement. If you buy $BTCBULL today for $0.002585, you could see a return of 2401% if it reaches our end-of-2025 price prediction of $0.06467. Seize the Market by the Horns June\u2019s crypto start-up funding figures and the continued push towards innovation paint a positive picture for the crypto market. For the savvy investor, picking projects like BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) to leverage the market\u2019s movements could be a smart move. Just be sure to act fast, as the presale is moments from closing, and with it, your chances of securing that free $BTC. Remember, this is not financial advice, and you should do your own research before making any investment decisions."
