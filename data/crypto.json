      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-repeats-history-key-support-holds-again-ahead-of-potential-rally/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is at a critical juncture after breaking above key resistance but failing to sustain momentum toward the psychological $3,000 level. The recent surge brought optimism to the market, yet ETH has now pulled back slightly, struggling to extend gains as global uncertainty weighs on sentiment. With macro pressures mounting and negotiations between the US and China over a potential trade deal in focus, the broader market appears to be awaiting clarity before making its next decisive move. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Top analyst Rekt Capital offered historical context to Ethereum\u2019s current setup, pointing to two previous cycles where ETH successfully retested the $2,500 level before launching toward $4,000. In August 2021 and again in early 2024, ETH held $2,500 as strong support (green circles), acting as the foundation for a major breakout rally. This repeating pattern has investors now eyeing the same level with growing interest. As Ethereum trades near $2,750\u2013$2,800, the coming days could determine whether this current setup mirrors past bullish cycles\u2014or if momentum fades again. With strong support beneath and a clear historical roadmap above, ETH\u2019s ability to reclaim strength could trigger the next leg in what many believe may be the start of altseason. Ethereum Echoes Past Patterns Ahead Of Potential Breakout Ethereum has rallied over 100% since its April lows, showcasing powerful momentum and heightened activity at current levels. After briefly tapping a local high near $2,830, ETH has retraced slightly but remains firmly above the $2,750 mark\u2014a key area that now acts as short-term support. The strength of this rebound is fueling growing speculation that Ethereum may not only be preparing for another leg up but also setting the tone for a broader altseason. Analysts across the board are closely watching ETH\u2019s current consolidation, with many citing historical patterns as a reason for optimism. Notably, Rekt Capital highlighted a recurring pattern that has previously led to significant rallies. In August 2021, Ethereum successfully retested the $2,500 level as support before surging to approximately $4,000. The same thing occurred in early 2024, when ETH once again bounced from $2,500 and rallied to the same zone. Now, for the past five weeks, Ethereum has repeatedly confirmed the $2,500 level as solid support, forming what appears to be a textbook foundation for another major move. This accumulation phase\u2014mirroring past cycles\u2014has many traders confident that ETH could soon reclaim $3,000 and begin leading altcoins higher. With macro conditions still uncertain and market participants looking for signals of strength, Ethereum\u2019s behavior at these levels carries added significance. If ETH can maintain its position above $2,750 and build momentum through $2,830, the market could see an explosive shift in sentiment, potentially triggering the next phase of the bull cycle. For now, all eyes remain on Ethereum as it tests the top of its multi-week range with bullish conviction. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance \u2013 Breakout Or Breakdown? ETH Holds Above Breakout Zone After $2,830 Rejection Ethereum is currently trading at $2,749 on the 4-hour chart, holding above a key breakout zone between $2,700 and $2,740 following a brief rejection at $2,830. After breaking above this multi-week resistance last week, ETH surged into higher territory before pulling back in the last few sessions. Despite this retrace, the price has so far maintained support above the previous resistance area, now acting as a strong demand zone. This range\u2014highlighted by the yellow box on the chart\u2014served as a ceiling for nearly a month before being flipped into support during the breakout. Ethereum is now consolidating right above this area, and as long as it remains above the 50 and 100 simple moving averages (SMAs), the bullish structure is intact. Volume has started to cool off slightly, suggesting that traders are waiting for a decisive move\u2014either a bounce toward $2,800\u2013$2,900 or a breakdown back below $2,700. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level \u2013 No Clear Breakout Yet A successful hold of this support zone could confirm the retest and build momentum for another breakout attempt. However, failure to hold $2,700 could see ETH revisit the 200 SMA around $2,570. For now, Ethereum remains technically strong, but traders are watching closely for confirmation.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-19500-with-hs-pattern/",
      "summary": "Ethereum reclaimed a significant technical level in the latest 24-hour trading session, with its price crossing above the $2,800 mark and briefly touching $2,870. This interesting cross makes it the first time since February 2025 that Ethereum has traded above the $2,800 threshold. The move comes amid rising bullish momentum flowing out from Bitcoin, and according to recent analysis from a crypto expert, this could be just the beginning of a much larger rally for Ethereum. Technical Pattern Says Ethereum Could Be Close To $20,000 An interesting technical formation on Ethereum has now caught the attention of some traders: a classic inverse Head and Shoulders bottom. According to crypto expert Gert van Lagen, who shared his analysis on the social media platform X, this inverse head and shoulders is setting up on a long-term timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Specifically, Ethereum&#8217;s two-week candlestick chart, shared by the analyst, reveals a fully formed structure with a left shoulder in mid-2021, a pronounced head that took shape during the bear market in late 2022 to early 2023, and a right shoulder forming throughout the 2024 correction into early 2025. The left shoulder emerged in mid-2021, when Ethereum\u2019s price peaked around $4,870, then retraced into the year-end. The head was formed at the lows around $1,350 in 2022 and 2023. The right shoulder is currently in formation after the Ethereum price rebounded from roughly $1,600 in 2025. Finally, this pattern is also highlighted by a symmetry around the neckline drawn near the $4,200 price region. Keeping this in mind, the neckline of the pattern, which is anchored just below the $4,200 resistance level, is now the most important level to break above. A confirmed breakout above this zone could activate the full bullish target projected by the technical formation. ETH Price Close To $20,000 According to Gert van Lagen, the two-week head-and-shoulders pattern suggests Ethereum may be \u201ccloser to $20K than most anticipate.\u201d His price target calculation follows a classic technical methodology. By measuring the vertical distance from the head\u2019s lowest point to the neckline resistance and then projecting that same distance upward from the neckline, he arrives at a target of approximately $19,500, which is more than a 600% gain from today\u2019s price levels. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric In the same analysis, van Lagen also highlighted a descending broadening wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-2023. This secondary structure reinforces the notion that Ethereum may embark on a significantly larger breakout once $4,200 is cleared. However, this projection of $19,500 is based on the technical symmetry of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, rather than fundamental shifts in Ethereum. Additionally, there is no clear timeline for this target; however, based on the multi-year nature of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the price target may also take up to four years to materialize. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,772, having retraced slightly from $2,870. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "DeFi Development Corp. hit a major roadblock this week when the US Securities and Exchange Commission blocked its $1 billion registration filing. The move came after regulators found that the company\u2019s Form S-3 lacked a key internal controls report tied to its 10-K. As a result, DeFi Development\u2014formerly known as Janover\u2014pulled the filing and said it will fix the paperwork before trying again. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Missing Controls Report According to the SEC, the registration was ineligible because it did not include the required internal controls over financial reporting. That report is a must for any firm raising capital through public offerings. Without it, the commission won\u2019t even consider your request. DeFi Development filed in late April 2025 but overlooked this step, a basic requirement in US securities law. DeFi Development (formerly Janover) has withdrawn its $1 billion Form S-3 registration after the SEC deemed it ineligible due to missing a required internal controls report in its Form 10-K. No securities were issued, and part of the proceeds had been intended for purchasing\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 11, 2025 Plan To Buy Solana Based on reports, the company aimed to use the funds to buy Solana tokens. Solana ranks as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The filing showed some of the $1 billion would go toward staking rewards and token purchases. Staking can earn regular returns, but only if SOL holds or gains value. Putting such a large stake into one chain carries risks if market prices dip. Withdrawal And Next Steps DeFi Development confirmed that no securities were issued during this process. It said it plans to refile once the controls report is in place. A quick resubmission\u2014perhaps within 30 or 45 days\u2014would signal they were almost ready. Investors will watch whether the company brings in an experienced underwriter or auditor to prevent another slip. Related Reading: TRX Price Up As Tron Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Trump-Backed Stablecoin Market Reaction Some traders had hoped the influx of a billion dollars in Solana tokens would boost the price. Now that the filing is on hold, those bets may stall. Markets often react when big purchases are delayed.

What Comes Next DeFi Development\u2019s experience highlights that crypto firms must meet the same rules as any other public issuer. Skipping standard checks can derail even the boldest plans. The company\u2019s next move will show how well it can balance its blockchain ambitions with straightforward regulatory steps. For now, the token-buy plan waits in limbo, and everyone from investors to developers will be watching the next filing. Featured image from Reuters, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/will-dogecoin-moon-or-crash-indicator-holds-answer/",
      "summary": "According to market technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) a single metric\u2014the 20-month simple moving average\u2014could be the line that could separate another vertical rally from a gut-wrenching breakdown for Dogecoin. Currently, DOGE sits comfortable above that moving average, now plotted at $0.1751. The black curve on Cat\u2019s chart shows only three clean retests of the 20-month SMA since 2014. All Eyes On Dogecoin\u2019s 20-Month SMA The first came in March 2017, when price tapped the average near $0.00020 and then ripped more than 9,000% into the January 2018 peak. The second occurred in the winter of 2020, with price kissing the average at roughly one-fourth of one cent before the parabolic 34,500% run to $0.73 the following May. The third and current encounter began in August last year when DOGE rallied by more than 480%. As of today, two successive monthly candles dipped into the zone just below twenty-cents, but both were bought aggressively, leaving higher wicks and preserving the upward slope of the average. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as that moving average remains intact, \u201cwe\u2019re going higher.\u201d A decisive monthly close beneath $0.175 would, by this read, place the entire structure at risk and could usher in the sort of multi-month down-trend that followed the 2018 and 2021 climaxes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Moment This Month, Predicts Analyst TOTAL2 Needs To Break Out Analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) overlays that micro view on a much broader canvas. His chart tracks the total crypto market capitalization ex-Bitcoin (TradingView ticker \u201cTOTAL2\u201d) in monthly candles back to 2017. Two bold yellow trend-lines define a seven-year rising channel whose upper rail repelled price at the January 2018 and November 2021 alt-season tops. Since the June 2022 low, the market has carved out an ascending triangle: a rising series of higher lows presses against a flat-topped supply zone between roughly $1.43 trillion and $1.7 trillion. The apex of the triangle now looms; aggregate alt-cap is already worth about $1.2 trillion \u2014 all that stands between the current print and a confirmed breakout is a monthly close above the upper edge of that yellow rectangle. Kevin\u2019s projection measures the height of the pattern and adds it to the breakout level, dropping a vertical marker that intersects the mid-channel near $5.89 trillion. Kevin\u2019s first Fibonacci extensions target is the 1.618 at $4.06 trillion. Higher extensions at 1.886, 2.0 and 2.618 cluster around $4.57 trillion, 5.89 trillion and $6.9 trillion respectively, the last of which coincides almost exactly with the channel\u2019s ceiling and is circled as the analyst\u2019s ultimate upside objective. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Why does that matter for Dogecoin? The meme-coin\u2019s two explosive cycles began only after TOTAL2 had broken its own prior-cycle high and money poured into non-Bitcoin assets. Kevin states that \u201caltcoins are just scratching the surface of what is possible in the coming months,\u201d provided that macro-liquidity and regulatory factors permit capital rotation out of Bitcoin into the wider market. In that scenario the 20-month SMA on DOGE would likely continue to slope higher, setting the stage for an explosive move higher. Conversely, failure of the alt-cap triangle would make a sustained loss of the SMA far more probable, robbing DOGE of its historical launch-pad. For now, the indicator holds\u2014and with it the prospect that Dogecoin could be primed for yet another bout of furious upside. But as both analysts caution, the monthly close will tell the story: above the 20-month SMA and an alt-cap breakout, or below it and back into hibernation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-enters-perfect-setup/",
      "summary": "The XRP price is reportedly positioning for a potential breakout as it forms a textbook Falling Wedge pattern, which a crypto analyst calls a perfect bullish setup. After a successful retest of a keg buy zone, technical indicators suggest that XRP is preparing for a powerful move toward the $3.7 level soon. Falling Wedge Setup Signal XRP Price Breakout XRP is currently entering what Robert Mercer, a TradingView crypto analyst, describes as the perfect breakout setup following a prolonged period of consolidation. This technical structure suggests that XRP could potentially experience a sharp rally from its current price of $2.25 to the $3.70 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Remains Bullish Above $2, This Falling Channel Says $3.8 Is Coming Notably, on the 2-day XRP price chart, Mercer noted that the cryptocurrency has been consolidating within a Falling Wedge pattern since late December 2024. Since establishing a local bottom at $2.11 in the same timeframe, the altcoin has repeatedly tested this bottom level without breaking below it in a sustained manner. The $2.11 price zone has also acted as a reliable horizontal support level throughout the six-month Falling Wedge formation. Meanwhile, XRP\u2019s price action has been gradually compressing within the wedge pattern, indicating reduced volatility and increasing pressure near the wedge apex. Looking at the TradingView analyst\u2019s chart, it appears that XRP is now approaching the Falling Wedge resistance at the upper boundary, which coincides with the $2.45 level, where a buy retest has occurred. This convergence is viewed as a potential confirmation zone. If buying momentum continues and XRP closes decisively above $2.45, the breakout would confirm the end of the Falling Wedge and potentially initiate the cryptocurrency\u2019s next upward move. Mercer highlights that XRP\u2019s current bullish structure is a simple yet perfect setup. And based on this setup, price targets above the wedge are projected in several stages, with $2.98, $3.36 and $3.71 serving as resistance levels based on historical price action and technical extensions. If the breakout holds and buying interest persists, the TradingView expert predicts that XRP may reach the $3.5 &#8211; $4 region over the next three to five months, aligning with past performances following similar wedge breakouts in the market. $1.40 Breakdown Still In Play If Resistance Fails While XRP\u2019s current structure supports a bullish outlook, Mercer\u2018s price chart shows that a failed breakout remains a possibility. If XRP is rejected again at the $2.45 resistance level, it could resume its consolidation within the Falling Wedge pattern. This would place downward pressure on the price and may lead to a retest of lower support zones. Related Reading: Why A Sweep At $2 Is Important For XRP Price To Continue Rallying The most critical support level in this bearish scenario is located around $1.4. While this price level has not been tested directly in recent months, it marks the lower boundary of the Falling Wedge pattern. A breakdown below this level could invalidate the XRP\u2019s wedge and bullish setup. It may also indicate a possible shift in market structure from consolidation to bearish continuation, which could result in further downside.
