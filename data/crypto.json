      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-roadmap-to-8-5/",
      "summary": "XRP is starting to draw attention again as signs of a potential breakout begin to take shape. With market sentiment gradually shifting and XRP holding key support levels, analysts suggest that the stage may be set for the next impulse wave. If momentum continues to build and critical resistances are cleared, XRP could be on the verge of an explosive price rally to $8.5. Elliott Wave Points To Major XRP Price Breakout Paul Webborn, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has released a new XRP forecast update, reinforcing his bullish stance on the third-largest cryptocurrency. In his analysis, the market expert reveals that XRP may be entering a powerful impulse phase, with projected targets potentially reaching or even surpassing $8 in the current cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Is Moving According To Plan, Here\u2019s Why $1.90 Is Important Webborn\u2019s analysis applies Elliott Wave Theory to track XRP\u2019s price movements from its June 2022 low, identifying that point as the start of a new bullish cycle. The chart provides a visual roadmap of XRP\u2019s next moves based on the impulse wave structure. The cryptocurrency is expected to experience a short-term rise to initial targets below $8, followed by a brief pullback before a final rally that could push XRP to new all-time highs. Notably, the chart shows that primary Waves A and B have already played out, and XRP is now progressing through Wave C, which is unfolding in five intermediate waves. Intermediate waves 1 through 4 appear complete, with Wave 5 still forming. Webborn notes that this final fifth wave is expected to break down into five smaller minor waves. Minor wave 3 is projected to push XRP toward the $5 and $6 range, while the full extension of Wave C could carry it to between $8 and $10. The analyst has set an invalidation level at $1.90, meaning any move below that would break the current bullish structure and possibly lead to further downward pressure on the XRP price. Webborn predicts that if the $1.90 level is broken, XRP could potentially experience a crash toward new lows around $0.287, marking more than an 87% decline from its present market price. However, the chart suggests that this low has already been reached, further reinforcing the bullish narrative that the altcoin may be on the verge of a major upward breakout. While Webborn has provided no specific timeline for his optimistic forecast, the analyst believes that the coming few months could be explosive as the market enters the next phase of the impulse. Update On Price Action Lately, the XRP price has maintained strong support above $2, showing strength despite an extended consolidation period. CoinMarketCap data shows that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $2.22, reflecting a modest 1.35% rise over the past day. Related Reading: Analyst Puts XRP Cycle High At $20-$30, Here\u2019s Why Although XRP is still priced significantly below its all-time high, data from CoinCodex shows that market sentiment remains highly bullish.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-hits-new-milestone-wallets-holding-0-1-sol-reach-record-high/",
      "summary": "Solana has returned to the spotlight as speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval gains momentum. While still unconfirmed, growing signals from market insiders suggest that regulatory green lights may not be far off. If approved, a Solana ETF would mark a major milestone for the ecosystem, opening the door to traditional capital flows and broader institutional exposure, similar to what Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced following their own ETF breakthroughs. For long-term investors, this development could set the foundation for a new phase of sustainable growth. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh data from Glassnode, which shows that the number of wallets holding over 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high. This milestone marks an increase in retail participation and growing confidence in Solana&#8217;s long-term potential. As the network continues to mature, the rise in small holders also signals expanding grassroots adoption\u2014an encouraging sign during a period of market uncertainty. While short-term price action may still be driven by broader macro trends, sentiment around Solana is clearly improving. If ETF approval becomes a reality, the combination of increased accessibility and rising on-chain adoption could significantly boost Solana\u2019s market position in the coming months. Solana Growing On-Chain Adoption Solana is currently trading below the $150 mark after experiencing a sharp retracement from its May high. The asset has lost more than 20% in value since peaking earlier this cycle, driven largely by broader market consolidation and declining risk appetite across altcoins. Despite the recent pullback, SOL continues to hold a strong support zone near the $135\u2013$140 range, which has proven resilient during previous sell-offs. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, noting that a sustained push above key supply zones\u2014particularly the $155\u2013$165 range\u2014could reignite bullish momentum. However, the market remains in a phase of indecision. Price action across major assets, including Solana, reflects uncertainty as traders wait for a clear breakout or breakdown to confirm the next move. Without a strong catalyst, SOL may continue to consolidate alongside the broader altcoin market. Amid the sideways price action, one encouraging signal is the growing on-chain adoption. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Glassnode showing that the number of wallets holding over 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high, now exceeding 11.44 million. This steady rise in non-zero wallets points to expanding retail participation and long-term holder confidence, even as short-term volatility persists. The divergence between price action and user adoption suggests that Solana\u2019s fundamental growth remains intact. If momentum returns and macro conditions improve, Solana may be well-positioned for a breakout, especially with ETF rumors fueling speculative interest. For now, the $150 level remains a psychological pivot as the market watches for signs of direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near SOL Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $149.30, just below the key resistance confluence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all clustered between $150 and $151. This area has acted as a strong technical barrier, and SOL&#8217;s repeated failure to reclaim it reflects the market&#8217;s hesitancy amid broader uncertainty. After rallying to $159.99 earlier in the session, bears stepped in and pushed the price back down, closing the candle with a bearish wick, signaling ongoing selling pressure. The chart reveals a prolonged consolidation pattern that has developed since the mid-May rejection near $180. Despite several bounce attempts, SOL has not been able to regain bullish momentum. The volume profile also suggests fading interest during upswings, a common trait during accumulation or exhaustion phases. Notably, price remains above the March low, preserving a key higher low structure, which is crucial for the broader bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles Below ATH After Weeks Of Failed Attempts \u2013 $109K Level In Focus If SOL breaks above the $151\u2013$155 range with sustained volume, it could trigger a move toward $180. However, failure to clear this resistance might lead to another test of support around $135. Traders should watch for a decisive close above the moving average cluster to confirm trend continuation, especially with ETF speculation fueling long-term optimism.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-shows-adoption-strength-as-volume-still-led-by-big-transfers-details/",
      "summary": "Tron (TRX) is once again in the spotlight as it tests the upper and lower boundaries of a key consolidation range that has held for months. The price has been oscillating between $0.211 and $0.295\u2014a range that has acted as both support and resistance since the start of the year. With volatility gradually returning to the crypto market, a breakout from this zone could set the stage for a major directional move. A confirmed push above $0.295 could open the door for a rally toward uncharted territory, while a break below $0.211 might signal a deeper correction. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation According to new data from CryptoQuant, large transactions are currently driving volume dominance on the Tron network. While the majority of transactions on TRON are under $1,000 in size\u2014showing that retail users are actively engaged\u2014it is the high-value transfers that account for most of the total volume, highlighting growing institutional or whale interest in the network. As broader market conditions remain uncertain and altcoins begin to show signs of life, the coming weeks will be critical for TRX. Whether bulls or bears take control will likely depend on how the price reacts to this well-defined consolidation range. Tron Eyes Expansion Amid Growing Network Activity Tron has captured significant attention in recent weeks, driven by a combination of major announcements and strong on-chain activity. A report two weeks ago revealed that Tron is preparing to go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment. While full details have yet to be confirmed by official channels, sources familiar with the matter suggest the process is underway. If completed, this move could mark a historic moment for the blockchain space, giving Tron greater exposure to traditional investors and boosting institutional legitimacy. Despite these developments, price action remains locked in a consolidation phase. The broader market\u2019s volatility and macro uncertainty continue to suppress directional momentum for TRX. However, network fundamentals tell a different story\u2014Tron\u2019s on-chain activity is booming. Top analyst Darkfost highlighted a key insight: large transactions currently drive volume dominance on the TRON network. Although more than 1 million USDT transactions on TRON are below $1,000, just 16,000 transfers above $100,000 dominate in terms of volume. This divergence shows that while retail usage is high, major players are still actively moving large amounts of capital on the network. The consistent dominance of small transfers reflects Tron&#8217;s accessibility and everyday utility among users, while the growing transaction count signals expanding adoption. Together, these factors suggest that Tron is building strong foundations, regardless of short-term price direction. The coming weeks could be pivotal, especially if the public listing advances and TRX breaks its multi-month price range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near TRX Consolidates Near Resistance Amid Growing Momentum Tron is currently trading at $0.2787 after several weeks of sideways movement, as shown in the chart. The asset remains in a well-defined consolidation range between the $0.211 support zone and the $0.295 resistance. Despite several attempts, TRX has been unable to decisively break through the upper boundary, signaling market hesitation. However, the overall price structure remains constructive. The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) are all trending upward, with price currently testing the 50-day SMA as dynamic resistance. This alignment supports the argument for a longer-term bullish structure, even as short-term consolidation continues. Volume has slightly picked up in recent days, suggesting a growing interest among traders. A clear breakout above $0.295 would likely trigger a new upward phase and bring fresh highs into play. Until then, traders are watching for confirmation, as the market tests the upper boundary of the range. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $269M In Net Inflows In 24H \u2013 Bullish Momentum Accelerates With strong fundamentals, increasing on-chain activity, and speculation about Tron\u2019s public listing via reverse merger, momentum could accelerate soon.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has warned about a potential crash for the Bitcoin price, after the flagship crypto closed below a critical resistance level. The analyst also highlighted the level that BTC needs to reclaim to invalidate this bearish setup. Bitcoin Price Risks Crash With Weekly Close Below Resistance In an X post, Rekt Capital revealed that the Bitcoin price has closed below the final major weekly resistance at around $108,890. Based on this, he remarked that a possible early-stage Lower High resistance may be developing at around $107,720, with BTC at risk of crashing. The analyst added that Bitcoin will need to reclaim $108,890 as support on the daily to invalidate this Lower High. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs In an earlier X post, Rekt Capital highlighted how significant it would have been if the Bitcoin price had closed above this final major weekly resistance. He noted that BTC had never performed such a weekly close. As such, if that had happened last week, he claimed it would not only be \u201chistoric\u201d but would enable BTC to enjoy a new uptrend into new all-time highs (ATHs). However, the Bitcoin price now appears to be on a downtrend, having failed to hold above the $107,720 level successfully. BTC had reached an intraday high of $107,970 but has since then been on a decline and is now at risk of losing the $106,800 macro level. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has warned that BTC being below this level puts it in the danger zone. Meanwhile, based on historical bull market cycles, Rekt Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still has some more upside left. In an X post, he stated that history suggests that Bitcoin may end its bull market in two to three months. BTC Still Fuel In The Tank Despite the recent Bitcoin price drop, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto declared that the flagship crypto still has fuel in the tank. He claimed that the weekly market structure remains strong with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The analyst added that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pushing towards its trendline.

He alluded to dojis that had formed for the flagship crypto in its current corrective channel and declared they were bullish for Bitcoin.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-network-volume-echoes-mid-2021-stable-equilibrium-is-a-big-move-brewing/",
      "summary": "After rebounding from a local bottom of around $75,000 in April, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be stuck in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, showing little indication of a clear directional trend. One key data point reflecting this indecision is Bitcoin\u2019s network volume. Bitcoin Network Volume Stuck In Balance Zone According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, Bitcoin\u2019s network volume has stabilized in a state of &#8216;stable equilibrium,&#8217; reminiscent of the mid-2021 consolidation phase that preceded a major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, Bitcoin network volume refers to the total value of BTC transferred across the blockchain over a specific period, typically used to gauge market activity and capital flow. Higher network volume suggests increased investor engagement and liquidity, while lower volume may indicate reduced interest or market stagnation. Notably, when BTC reached the upper end of its current range &#8211; around $110,000 &#8211; its average network volume surged to as high as $67 billion. Since then, the metric has slightly declined and now hovers around $58.7 billion. Since January 2024, Bitcoin\u2019s average network volume has ranged between $40 billion and $80 billion. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this corridor has become a key indicator of network activity balance and broader market sentiment. Historically, when the Bitcoin average volume approached the upper-end of the range at $80 billion, it coincided with local price peaks of $70,000 and $100,000. On the contrary, moves toward the lower-end &#8211; around $40 billion &#8211; were associated with short-term pullbacks, though these dips were often quickly bought up by market participants. Currently, the $58.7 billion reading sits near the midpoint of this range, mirroring the consolidation phase observed in mid-2021. The analyst explained: As long as the indicator remains above the $40 billion level, we can speak of a stable fundamental market condition. Rising volumes above the $80 billion mark will confirm strengthening activity and fresh capital inflow. On the other hand, a sustained drop below $40 billion will indicate weakening network demand and may be a harbinger of a deeper correction. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? While Bitcoin network volume suggests the market is in a state of equilibrium, some on-chain metrics hint at a potential breakout building in the background &#8211; possibly paving the way for renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall For example, the BTC short-term holder floor has been rising steadily in recent months, currently hovering around $98,000. This provides a strong support base, potentially preventing a sharp downside correction.

At press time, BTC trades at $106,528, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"
