      "summary": "After a volatile but bullish start to June, Solana (SOL) is now facing strong selling pressure amid rising global uncertainty. The sudden escalation in the Middle East\u2014triggered by Israel\u2019s recent strike on Iran\u2014has sparked market-wide volatility, prompting a flight to safety and a pullback across risk assets. Solana, which had been showing momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, has dropped over 15% since June 11, erasing much of its early-month gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History \u2013 Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally As macro risks continue to rise, the altcoin market remains vulnerable to further downside. SOL is now approaching a critical technical level, and a breakdown could signal deeper losses if global tensions persist. Top analyst Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now re-testing a key daily demand zone, a level that previously supported bullish continuation. If this area fails to hold, Solana could revisit lower support levels seen earlier this year. For now, traders are watching closely to see if buyers step in to defend the zone or if further conflict will fuel more risk-off behavior. The next few days will be critical in determining whether SOL can bounce or if the broader market downturn intensifies. Solana Re-Tests Key Support As Market Tensions Mount Solana is standing below key levels, retracing after a brief rally attempt earlier this week. The asset had spent several days consolidating beneath the $170 level, failing to break above resistance as selling pressure intensified amid rising global tensions. Now, with the broader market on edge following the Israel\u2013Iran conflict escalation, SOL finds itself back at a critical support zone. Bulls remain cautiously optimistic, encouraged by the broader market\u2019s resilience and the potential for Bitcoin and Ethereum to regain strength. However, caution dominates sentiment as Solana, like most altcoins, still trades significantly below its all-time high near $260. The current environment of geopolitical risk and macroeconomic uncertainty has suppressed momentum in the altcoin space, making support levels all the more important. Cheds highlighted in a recent update that Solana is now re-testing a key daily demand zone around the $145 level. This zone has previously acted as a launchpad for bullish moves, and holding above it could provide the structure needed for a new leg higher. However, failure to maintain this level might open the door for further downside, with the next major support below $130. For now, all eyes are on how Solana reacts around $145. A solid bounce with increased volume could attract short-term buyers looking to ride a potential recovery. But with global markets rattled by uncertainty, the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether this demand zone becomes a springboard\u2014or a trapdoor. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support \u2013 Can Bulls Defend This Level? SOL Price Analysis: Re-Test of Support as Volatility Spikes Solana is currently trading at $145.24 after an aggressive drop from the $165\u2013$170 range. The 4-hour chart shows a clear breakdown below all key moving averages (50, 100, and 200), which had previously served as dynamic support. The red 200 SMA at $165.33 now acts as overhead resistance, capping short-term recovery attempts. The recent sell-off\u2014triggered by broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East\u2014pushed SOL straight into a key demand zone around $143\u2013$145, where buyers have historically stepped in. The long lower wick from today\u2019s candle reflects strong intraday buying at these levels, suggesting that some participants see this as a value zone. However, volume remains elevated, and the structure appears fragile. Any failure to hold $145 could open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $130 region. On the flip side, reclaiming the 100 SMA at $157.46 would be an early sign of renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Momentum indicators likely remain oversold, and if the broader market stabilizes, this level could mark a temporary bottom. Still, with volatility high and macro uncertainty looming, traders may want to stay cautious until a clear direction emerges. For now, $145 is the line in the sand.

      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s price action this week has been very notable, with the leading altcoin breaking above $2,800 again for the first time in four months. Ethereum managed to break above the $2,800 mark for the first time since February, briefly touching $2,870 before pulling back slightly. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 Cycle? Here\u2019s The Target Two separate analyses by crypto strategist Crypto Patel on the social media platform X suggests Ethereum is now on the right track. The first, based on an 8-hour chart, highlights a rally toward $4,000. The second, using a long-term two-week timeframe, outlines a bullish setup that could send Ethereum soaring to $10,000 and beyond. Ethereum\u2019s Breakout From Sideways Consolidation Zone In a recent analysis shared on X, a crypto analyst known as Crypto Patel highlighted Ethereum\u2019s attempt to break out of its established range. Using the 8-hour candlestick chart, he pointed out how the Ethereum had spent many weeks since early May trading between clear support at $2,366 and resistance around $2,734. The breakout seen on the chart occurred just above this resistance zone, when Ethereum briefly pushed past $2,800 before facing some rejection. If this breakout holds above $2,800, Ethereum could initiate a steep upward rally toward the $3,500 to $4,000 region in the coming weeks. Crypto Patel noted the importance of watching whether Ethereum sustains above the $2,750 breakout line, as a successful confirmation could trigger an influx of bullish momentum. Ethereum\u2019s To $10,000 In The Long-Term In a follow-up post analyzing a much larger timeframe, Crypto Patel shared a two-week candlestick chart that mapped Ethereum\u2019s longer-term structure since 2018. The chart revealed a well-defined bullish setup, including a bounce from a key bullish order block around $1,400 in April. This bounce acted as a support level, with the resulting candlestick being a bullish one that broke through another order block between $1,700 and $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Patel pointed out that Ethereum is now showing signs of a long-term bullish continuation pattern. With support levels already locked in for the next bear market, the analyst projected a target above $10,000, citing a 438% upside potential from current price levels. The chart also marks $2,500 as a structural pivot point, with Ethereum\u2019s ongoing upward trajectory expected to strengthen if this support level continues to hold. Therefore, the path to $10,000 will depend on Ethereum\u2019s ability to turn its recent resistance break into sustained momentum. The $2,800 region must now serve as a support base rather than a resistance ceiling. However, this has failed to really materialize in the past 24 hours, as Ethereum is currently down by a massive 9.6%. The ensuing price action has seen the leading altcoin now back trading within this consolidation range. Failure to hold above $2,500 could cascade to more losses over the weekend until it closes on $2,366 again and probably initiate another bounce from here.

      "summary": "\u201cMen lie, women lie, but charts and numbers do not lie,\u201d EGRAG CRYPTO stated in a recent post on X, as he highlighted the importance of the Fib 0.5 level in XRP Dominance. According to him, this level has historically served as a major resistance zone. It acted as a key barrier in October 2019 and November 2020, both instances marking the onset of bear markets. In the current cycle, the Fib 0.5 level has once again proven significant, as it has rejected price advances in January and March 2025. The Knocking On The Door Analogy For XRP To drive his point home, EGRAG CRYPTO introduced what he called the \u201cKnocking on the Door\u201d analogy, a simple yet powerful metaphor to explain how resistance levels work in technical analysis. He stated that resistance is like a door; each time it is tested or &#8220;knocked on,&#8221; the likelihood of it eventually opening increases. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Perfect Setup After Buy Retest \u2013 Next Stop $3.7 EGRAG pointed out that XRP Dominance has now tested this macro resistance level four separate times. These repeated tests are not just coincidences; they indicate building pressure at that level. Traders and analysts often interpret such repeated encounters as signs that the asset is preparing for a significant move, as momentum continues to build with each attempt to break through resistance. Looking ahead, EGRAG suggested that the fifth \u201cknock\u201d on this resistance level might be the one that finally breaks it. If this happens, XRP Dominance could form a bullish Bull Flag pattern, a technical formation that often precedes upward moves. According to EGRAG, this breakout could propel XRP Dominance to around 27%, marking a major shift in its market strength and possibly setting the stage for a broader bullish trend. Market Cap Projection &#38; Future Potential The analyst unveiled a compelling projection that has stirred excitement within the XRP community: if XRP reaches a price of $27 with a 27% market dominance, this could push the total market capitalization to $5.5 trillion. This bold forecast reflects not only the possible future strength of XRP but also envisions a significant expansion of the broader crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Price Takes a Breather\u2014Consolidation Phase or Bullish Setup? He further explained that with a $5.5 trillion total market cap, XRP claiming 27% of that share would result in a market capitalization of approximately $1.485 trillion. Such a figure would further solidify its status as a key player in the blockchain space. He maintained that XRP could still reach $27 while maintaining 27% market dominance, especially if the overall market experiences a strong bullish cycle. In his view, $1.485 trillion is not just a dream but a viable target that highlights XRP\u2019s massive growth potential. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-crash-to-94000-imminent/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price action has shown signs of fading momentum three weeks after reaching a new all-time high of $111,814. The leading cryptocurrency climbed back above $110,000 on Monday off the back of cooling U.S. inflation data and a temporarily weaker dollar. However, the rally was short-lived. Profit-taking, compounded by geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, has contributed to a risk-off environment that pushed Bitcoin down below $105,000 in the past 24 hours. This sharp reversal highlights a significant technical level that could decide whether Bitcoin sustains its uptrend or enters a crash towards $94,000. Final Fibonacci Resistance Holding The Line According to a new analysis shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst XForceGlobal on the social media platform X, Bitcoin\u2019s current corrective structure could deepen if it fails to overcome the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance level. The analyst highlighted that the bullish impulse that carried Bitcoin now appears to be losing steam. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 The price zone around $110,500, which is marked by the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance, has not been convincingly breached, casting doubt on the strength of the current wave structure. Bitcoin tested this level twice earlier this week, and, as noted by the analyst, if this resistance level fails to break soon, there is a slight possibility of a deeper pullback. If this pullback does occur, this would lead to the formation of a corrective wave C, and with distinct symmetry in an ABC corrective pattern. In this case of the corrective Wave C playing out, the next central area of interest lies around the $94,000 level, an area that aligns with the completion of a larger impulse Wave 2. Wave 2 Dip To $96,000 Before Bullish Wave 3 Begins The rundown of a corrective Wave 2 and a bearish impulse Wave 2 is based on the outlook of Bitcoin failing to clear the 88.6% Fibonacci resistance at $110,000. Applying the Elliott wave count on the current price action shows that the recent push to $111,814 all-time high was a larger bullish impulse Wave 1. However, the ensuing correction since then has also played out in the form of a sub-wave 123 structure, and an ABC corrective pattern. Altogether, these are expected to make up a larger corrective impulse Wave 2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Crash To $31,000 Amid 5-Wave Impulse Completion Nevertheless, XForceGlobal noted that Bitcoin is still in a highly bullish structure on the macro level. If the price action plays out this way, the next move after the impulse Wave 2 to $94,000 would be a reversal upwards with bullish impulse Wave 3. In this case, the analyst projected an expansion move that would send Bitcoin to another all-time high. Notably, the price target in this case would be a surge above $118,500. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000, down by 2.5% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
