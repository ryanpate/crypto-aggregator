      "summary": "Bitcoin punched through a fresh record above $122,000 on the morning of 14 July, extending its month-long rally to more than 16 percent. Against that backdrop, Charles Edwards\u2014the founder and chief executive of digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments\u2014argues that the market is only \u201cin the early stages\u201d of a much broader liquidity-driven boom that could dominate the rest of 2025 and beyond. The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle In the latest Capriole newsletter, Edwards contends that \u201cmoney and liquidity provided the backdrop for capital flows, and Bitcoin Treasury Companies are the funnel.\u201d He dismisses the idea that the past fortnight\u2019s $20,000 advance was a technical accident, pointing instead to deep macro currents that have been building for months. \u201cThe biggest Bitcoin rallies occur when the market is net short the USD,\u201d he writes, pointing to Capriole\u2019s proprietary \u201cUSD Positioning\u201d gauge, which aggregates futures data across major currencies. The metric has been \u201cdeeply negative\u201d since early summer, signalling that global investors are decisively betting against the dollar and in favour of hard assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Soar To $146K In The Next Leg Up \u2014 Analyst Explains How Another pillar is credit. BBB-rated corporate-bond spreads have been grinding tighter since the spring, a classic risk-on signal in traditional markets that, since 2020, has mapped almost tick-for-tick onto major Bitcoin up-moves. \u201cMore evidence,\u201d Edwards notes, \u201cthat Bitcoin is a tradfi asset.\u201d Perhaps the strongest tail-wind, however, is raw money growth. Global M3 has been expanding at an annualised nine percent clip\u2014an historically extreme rate that Capriole says last coincided with average 12-month Bitcoin returns of roughly 460 percent. Edwards cautions that, as a multi-trillion-dollar asset today, Bitcoin is unlikely to repeat that magnitude, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see something very substantial from here.\u201d Capriole\u2019s framework also draws on an historical lead-lag relationship between gold and Bitcoin. When bullion enters a meaningful breakout, Bitcoin has tended to follow three to four months later. Gold\u2019s early-2025 surge\u2014and its outperformance versus global equities\u2014therefore offered \u201cstrong support for the current market\u2019s diminishing demand for fiat money and favour of hard money,\u201d Edwards argues. Since Capriole flagged gold\u2019s move in April, Bitcoin has risen 28 percent. Equities, too, are offering green lights. The New York Stock Exchange advance\u2013decline line broke to new highs last week, while Capriole\u2019s \u201cEquity Premium\u201d indicator reset to zero in late May\u2014both historically consistent with multi-month stretches of expanding risk appetite. All of those data points feed into the firm\u2019s flagship Bitcoin Macro Index, a composite of dozens of public and proprietary variables that Capriole uses to shape trading exposures in its fund. The index \u201cis still in strong positive growth territory,\u201d Edwards reports, even after the coin\u2019s latest vertical move. That suggests the underlying drivers\u2014liquidity, risk sentiment and on-chain activity\u2014\u201cremain intact.\u201d The Bitcoin Treasury-Company Flywheel Yet perhaps the most striking piece of the puzzle lies outside pure macro. Edwards highlights the emergence of Bitcoin Treasury Companies (TCs)\u2014corporate vehicles that raise fiat capital in equity or debt markets and then deploy it into spot BTC\u2014as the new \u201cprimary bubble dynamic of this cycle.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800\u2014Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? Quarterly inflows into TCs reached $15 billion in Q2, and Capriole counts at least 145 such firms now pursuing the strategy. With their market capitalisations inflated by paper gains on balance-sheet coins, they can tap ever-larger funding rounds\u2014a reflexive loop that Edwards believes \u201cwill likely help add over $1 trillion to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap over the next year.\u201d He rejects the notion that this amounts to unhealthy centralisation: \u201cIf Bitcoin is to one day become base money, it needs to scale to tens of trillions to flatten volatility. The only way that happens is mass acquisition like we are seeing today.\u201d Edwards stresses that his analysis sits on a months-long horizon. \u201cWhen Bitcoin sees huge rallies there are always strong pullbacks and local overheating,\u201d he concedes, adding that the newsletter deliberately sidelines short-term on-chain froth to focus on the \u201cbigger picture and driving factors for the next six months.\u201d Still, with central-bank liquidity abundant, the dollar crowded short, credit stress muted and a structurally new pool of corporate buyers stepping in, Capriole\u2019s conclusion is unambiguous: the liquidity tap is wide open, and the Bitcoin supercycle it feeds has only just begun. \u201cWhile today\u2019s early adopters may be seen as speculators, it will be very obvious in hindsight. After the Treasury company wave is the Government treasury wave (next cycle). We are simply riding the adoption curve which requires trillions of dollars to flow in to Bitcoin from the entities that have it in order to achieve scale,\u201d Edwards concludes.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-possible/",
      "summary": "After hitting a new all-time high of $121,400, the Bitcoin price has started consolidating once again, although the support continues to hold. This is not out of the ordinary, as pullbacks after a major rally are quite common and could be the cool-off needed the uptrend to continue. However, while the $117,000 support has held nicely, it is possible that a deeper correction could be in the cards for the cryptocurrency before the price takes off again. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Could Begin With the hit to new all-time highs, the weekend brought a slowdown, and this could drive the next wave of correction. Crypto analyst TehThomas explains this in a TradingView post that suggests that there is still the possibility of a short-term correction for the Bitcoin price. However, it could go deeper than expected as the price moves to retest newly formed support at $109,000 and $110,000. Related Reading: Ripple\u2019s $21 Trillion Dream: What Capturing 20% Of SWIFT Volume Means For XRP According to the analyst, the new peaks have plunged the Bitcoin price into uncharted territory, and there would be a new wave of sells from here. Given this, the analyst advices caution as investors engage with the market and the possibility of a deeper correction arises. Furthermore, there is the formation of an ascending trendline that formed with the horizontal support. Since the trendline moves through the $111,000-$113,000 area, it suggests that the price could fall back downward to retest this level. In the case of a deeper correction, then the analyst sees a price sweep into the $110,000 levels to take out liquidity. However, this sweep would be inherently bullish since the retest would provide a bounce-off point that could lead to a \u201cmore sustainable\u201d breakout toward all-time highs. Bullish Prospects Still At Large For BTC While the possibility of a sweep down to former peak levels remains high, it is also possible that the price does not break down and instead continues its upward trajectory. Looking back at the ascending trendline, the analyst points out that it is possible that the price does hold the trendline, reducing the impact of the correction. Such a shallow correction would indicate a continuation without a deeper correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stalls After Rally: Will It Blast Through $125,000 Or Slip Back To $110K? In this case, the Bitcoin price could resume the uptrend with the $120,000-$125,000 targets in mind. Thus, any deep correction would be expected to begin at much higher price levels. &#8220;Bitcoin is currently in price discovery, which means the structure must guide our expectations. A retest of either the trendline or former resistance could provide the next best entry,\u201d TehThomas explained. Regardless of what the case may be, the analyst believes that as long as the price remains above the $110,000 support, then it is inherently bullish.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ripples-21-trillion-dream-what-capturing-20-of-swift-volume-means-for-xrp/",
      "summary": "Ripple Labs, a crypto payments company, continues to set its ambitions and those of XRP higher than ever as it edges closer to disrupting the global financial messaging giant SWIFT. After Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously projected that XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT\u2019s volume, new estimates now point to even bolder targets. How Ripple Securing 20% Of SWIFT Could Impact XRP A new report by Paul Barron, a technologist and crypto analyst, has revealed an updated forecast for Ripple. The report highlights XRP\u2019s growing potential to take on SWIFT in cross-border transactions. Ripple\u2019s ambitions in the global financial infrastructure are becoming more tangible, as new projections suggest that XRP could eventually process up to 20% of SWIFT\u2019s transactional volume. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Notably, these fresh estimates come just a month after Garlinghouse and the Ripple company predicted a 14% share in SWIFT\u2019s volume within five years. Now, with increasing institutional traction, growing market momentum, and rapid adoption, expectations are rising sharply. SWIFT, the global messaging network used by international banks and financial institutions to securely transmit information and cross-border payment instructions, currently handles $150 trillion in annual transaction volume. Based on this large figure, Barron disclosed that Ripple&#8217;s previously predicted 14% transactional volume projection would mean $21 trillion flowing annually through the XRP Ledger (XRPL). While 14% of SWIFT\u2019s volume already represents a significant amount, Ripple now believes that XRP could handle an even greater share of the global cross-border payments market. Based on the same calculations used by Barron, if Ripple were to achieve 20% of SWIFT\u2019s volume, it would translate to approximately $30 trillion in annual value flowing through the XRP Ledger. This projection underscores Ripple\u2019s growing confidence in XRP as a viable alternative to the decades-old SWIFT network. The company has consistently indicated its goals to replace SWIFT, with XRP becoming a central player in transforming the global payments structure. XRP Scaling Potential And Market Implications The vision of XRP processing a significant amount of SWIFT\u2019s volume annually raises major implications for its scalability, long-term utility and valuation. At such a scale, XRP would not merely be a bridge currency for remittance but a pillar in the future of traditional finance and digital currency markets. Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Ripple\u2019s strategy hinges on overtaking SWIFT\u2019s legacy system, which has long been criticized for its slow settlement times and high costs. The XRPL, with its near-instant settlement and low transaction fees, presents a modern alternative capable of streamlining transactions at scale. This expanding use case could elevate XRP, possibly even driving its current price of $2.78 higher to uncharted levels. If Ripple can execute its projections and secure 20% of SWIFT\u2019s volume, it would mark a turning point not just for the company but for the broader crypto industry.

      "summary": "After a powerful breakout last week that pushed Bitcoin into a new all-time high of $118,667, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency appears to be taking a breather. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $117,953, slightly below its recent peak. The move followed a string of consecutive daily gains as bullish momentum swept across the crypto industry. In a technical analysis shared on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst RLinda pointed out two scenarios that may play out over the coming days and weeks, depending on how Bitcoin reacts to nearby resistance and support levels. Related Reading: Don\u2019t Hold Back\u2014Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Support Zones Could Affect Bitcoin\u2019s Next Big Move RLinda\u2019s technical analysis begins with identifying the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s recent all-time high. Although Bitcoin has entered what seems to be a consolidation phase, there\u2019s no confirmed top just yet. The market structure still favors bullish continuation, especially considering Bitcoin is just coming out of a prolonged two-month consolidation zone and entering a realization phase. According to the 1-hour candlestick price chart, Bitcoin is currently trading just above a support area below $117,500. If Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, the leading cryptocurrency could kick off a cascade of corrections that could drive the price to $115,500, then potentially to $114,300, and even back to the previous all-time high of $111,800. Below that, the 0.5 and 0.705 Fibonacci levels around $113,031 and $111,960 respectively may act as temporary cushions. The last major defensive buy zone is around $110,400, where bulls may step in for a bounce. Basically, what this means is that if Bitcoin loses the support level at $115,500, it could slip back to $110,000 before encountering another strong buy support zone. Image From TradingView: RLinda Bitcoin To $125K, But It Must Breach Resistance First On the other hand, Bitcoin can still push above $118,000 and increase to $125,000, but only under certain conditions. The condition of the rally&#8217;s continuation depends primarily on Bitcoin registering a decisive daily close above $118,400 and $118,900. In her words, a daily close above these price levels would hint at a \u201cbreakout of structure.\u201d This, in turn, would confirm a transition from consolidation into another impulsive phase upward. In essence, both the bearish and bullish outlooks depend on how Bitcoin reacts at any of the important zones, either support at $116,700 or resistance above $118,400 before making a directional move. However, it is important to note that the consolidation after last week&#8217;s rally could last for weeks or even months, much like we&#8217;ve seen in previous rallies this cycle. According to the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric from Glassnode, Bitcoin\u2019s current level of long-term profitability sentiment is at 0.69. This is notably below the 0.75 mark associated with euphoric market conditions, despite Bitcoin having just printed a new all-time high.
