      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/chainlink-news/chainlink-reclaims-key-structure-quiet-accumulation-could-fuel-25-30-surge/",
      "summary": "Chainlink (LINK) is up 21% from its Sunday lows, gaining momentum in an otherwise uncertain macro and geopolitical environment. While global tensions continue to spark volatility across markets, Chainlink has stood out for its resilience, supported by a series of strong partnerships and growing on-chain fundamentals. The recent price action signals a potential shift in trend, but analysts warn that a confirmed breakout is still needed before bulls can fully take over. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply Top analyst Henry Lord of Alts highlighted that LINK has endured months of persistent downtrend and unusually quiet price behavior. However, recent moves suggest that something is changing beneath the surface. Volume is increasing, volatility is picking up, and LINK is forming a base structure that could mark the end of its accumulation phase. Despite this strength, Chainlink remains technically locked within a consolidation range. A clean breakout above key resistance levels will be critical to trigger the next phase of upward momentum. Until then, traders are cautiously optimistic as LINK teases a larger move. Chainlink Prepares For A Decisive Move Chainlink is currently trading over 25% below its May high, reflecting the broader market impact of rising macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, especially the recent Middle East conflicts. Despite these pressures, LINK has managed to hold within a steady consolidation range, signaling resilience as the crypto market awaits its next decisive move. Maintaining prices above current levels is crucial. A breakdown here could open the door for deeper corrections. However, analyst Henry believes the tides may be turning. According to Henry, Chainlink has endured months of downtrend and silence, but a structural shift is now underway. His analysis highlights that the long-standing downtrend has been broken, and LINK has entered a clear accumulation and consolidation phase. \u201cThese zones often come before the loudest moves,\u201d Henry notes. Historically, such phases have preceded explosive rallies, and this time may be no different. If momentum picks up, a breakout toward the $25\u2013$30 range wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Henry also points out that periods of inactivity often mask the actions of smart money\u2014buying quietly before the broader market catches on. While it\u2019s easy to overlook assets during calm phases, that\u2019s often when the groundwork for major moves is laid. For now, Chainlink remains on watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month LINK Price Analysis: Signs of Reversal Emerge Chainlink is showing early signs of a trend reversal after months of consistent decline. As seen in the 12-hour chart, LINK recently rebounded from the $11.50 level and is now trading above $13.20. This recovery follows a steep drop that marked a new local low, but the bounce has pushed the price above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), now acting as short-term support at $13.50. Importantly, LINK is now testing the 100-day SMA (around $14.65), which previously served as resistance in late May and early June. If bulls manage to break and consolidate above this level, the next target lies near the 200-day SMA at $14.16\u2014a confluence zone that may act as a critical decision point for trend continuation or rejection. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support \u2013 $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move While the macro structure remains bearish, this short-term accumulation range suggests growing demand, especially as the price begins to form higher lows.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-could-rally-to-110000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price surge above $106,000 this week has reignited bullish sentiment across the market, with analysts suggesting that the stars are aligning for a rally to a new all-time high. From shifting geopolitical tensions to a major regulatory pivot in the United States (US), multiple macroeconomic factors appear to be setting the stage for Bitcoin\u2019s next explosive move. Ceasefire And Rate Cut Buzz Fuel Bitcoin Price Optimism Over the weekend, the Bitcoin price briefly slipped, triggering over $200 million in leveraged long liquidations. However, this dip proved short-lived as the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded swiftly above $100,000 following US President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a total ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This sudden de-escalation helped ease global market anxiety, pushing Bitcoin past $106,000 and oil prices sharply down from $77 to under $70. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters \u2018New Era\u2019 Simultaneously, Optimism is building that the US Federal Reserve (FED) could begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Sharing new data by CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, crypto analyst CW disclosed that the odds of a FED rate cut have increased to 18.6% by July 30 during the scheduled FOMC meeting. The report reveals that 81.4% of market participants believe the FED to keep rates unchanged at their current level. However, FedWatch\u2019s data indicates growing expectations for a rate cut by the September FOMC meeting, with 79% betting on a reduction and only 21.3% anticipating no change. Notably, lower interest rates generally benefit risk assets like Bitcoin by increasing liquidity and boosting investor sentiment. With geopolitical tensions easing and a possibly looser monetary policy on the horizon, Bitcoin could gain further momentum, potentially climbing to $110,000. Supporting this bullish forecast, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for a rally toward a new ATH of $110,000 following its recent reclaim of the key $103,500 level. Although a retracement to around $102,500 remains possible, Bennett believes that once BTC cleans up support around $103,400, formed during Monday\u2019s expansion, the next move could be parabolic. Regulatory Win Solidify Bitcoin\u2019s Position In TradFi Beyond anticipated rate cuts and ceasefire announcements, the US FED recently made a landmark policy shift that could have profound long-term implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. By removing \u201creputational risk\u201d as a factor in evaluating crypto firms\u2019 access to bank servicing, the FED is effectively ending a key pillar of Operation Checkpoint 2.0\u2014a campaign that restricted over 30 crypto and fintech companies from traditional financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Deviates From Global M2 Money Supply, Is The Bull Run Over? This recent change clears the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have also followed suit, green-lighting crypto activities for banks and allowing them to participate in the digital assets market without prior approval. Together, these moves mark a regulatory pivot that not only legitimizes the crypto industry but could also accelerate demand and capital inflows into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its already significant valuation.

That\u2019s a big number. In past cycles, once those balances peak, money often moves into smaller tokens. Right now, Bitcoin\u2019s price is steadying after recent swings. Stablecoin balances keep growing. I can\u2019t promise anything, but there\u2019s a strong chance that a powerful Altcoin Season will take hold in the third quarter of 2025.

The main reasons are the large amount of\u2026 https://t.co/TjRyxBxSKs \u2014 Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) June 24, 2025 Altcoin Season On The Horizon Based on forecasts from analyst Joao Wedson, altcoins could see a lift in Q3 2025. He points to the huge amount of stablecoin liquidity and persistent doubt among retail and big players. That stage of doubt has come before in other cycles, and it usually marks a turning point. When confidence returns, altcoins tend to surge. Investors Poised On The Sidelines Many holders seem ready to hit buy. They\u2019re holding onto stablecoins until charts, on-chain data or macro news clear up. A boost in stablecoin flows to exchanges could be one early hint that rotation is starting. Large moves by whale wallets into low-cap tokens may follow. In recent weeks, inflows of stablecoins into trading platforms have ticked higher. That\u2019s a key signal to watch. If weekly inflows rise sharply\u2014say above $5 billion\u2014it may show serious appetite building. Past cycles saw similar spikes just before altcoin rallies began. Another one to monitor is decentralized finance platform volume. When stablecoins move from wallets to lending or liquidity pools, it usually indicates that traders are looking for return and preparing to swap to other tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Market observers will also be monitoring Bitcoin&#8217;s consolidation range closely. If it remains above recent lows for a few weeks, that would give confidence a boost everywhere. Then we could see smaller cryptocurrencies move higher on new liquidity. Based on these signals, it looks like we\u2019re in a waiting game. Stablecoin supplies are at record levels, Bitcoin is settling, and altcoin sentiment remains low. When all that lines up just right, funds are likely to rotate. Then the altcoin sector could see new life. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/optimism/optimism-flickers-at-0-553/",
      "summary": "Crypto Man MAB, in his latest analysis on X, pointed out that Optimism (OP) is now priced at $0.553, showing a mild increase of +0.004 (+0.73%) within the last four hours. While the short-term movement is slightly positive, he emphasized that the overall trend has been bearish since the asset peaked near $0.75, marking a clear phase of correction in the market. Trend And Volume Analysis OF Optimism (PO) Delving into the trend, Crypto Man MAB observed that the asset&#8217;s short-term trend is leaning bearish. Over the past 24 hours, the price of OP has declined from a high of $0.564 to a low of $0.483, forming a downward trajectory. He noted that the longer-term outlook reinforces this sentiment, as the asset has dropped by a steep 71.02% over the last 180 days, clearly signaling sustained downward pressure. Related Reading: Aave Address Count On Optimism Rapidly Growing, Will Price Rise To New 13-Month High? Turning attention to volume behavior, Crypto Man MAB emphasized the significance of recent spikes in OP&#8217;s trading volume, particularly during the sharp price decline. He explained that this increase in volume often indicates heightened market participation, most likely driven by panic selling or stop-loss triggers. The volume surge during this dip suggests that the bears are still active and in control. In his analysis, Crypto Man MAB further mentioned that the Volume SMA reflects periodic surges, with the most recent peak aligning with the downward movement in price. This alignment between rising volume and falling price often reflects a strong bearish sentiment, reinforcing the downward pressure seen on the chart. Support, Resistance, And Indicators Examining OP&#8217;s support and resistance levels, the analyst points out that the current price is trading near $0.483. This zone could act as a potential support if selling pressure begins to slow, offering a chance for a temporary stabilization or bounce. However, a sustained break below this level might signal further downside in the near term. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Faces Potential Decline To $1.80 \u2014 Analyst On the flip side, the nearest resistance lies around $0.564, which represents the 24-hour high. If the price attempts a recovery, this level will likely serve as the first barrier to overcome. A successful move above it could signal improving sentiment, though further confirmation would be needed to shift the short-term bias away from bearish. Looking at the chart patterns, recent candlesticks show a mix of bullish and bearish activity, but the red candles have been more dominant. This pattern reinforces the ongoing downward momentum, indicating that sellers still have control. Until there is a visible shift in momentum, the overall tone remains cautious despite pockets of potential support. Featured image from YouTube, chart from Tradingview.com"
