Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price\u2019s Stuck, But Not for Long? Analyst Daan Crypto shared insights regarding the current Bitcoin price action. The analyst believes that BTC has been compressing over the past weeks. In that sense, a lot of traders are expecting a spike in volatility. As seen on the image below, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a tight range form by its monthly high sitting at $110,600 and a monthly low at around $100,000. Within this range, there are two key levels to watch: the area between $109,000 and $103,000. A breakout or breakdown from this range might signal the return of volatility to the Bitcoin price action. Thus, the cryptocurrency might reclaim or return to either or the previously mentioned levels on higher timeframes. The analyst stated the following: BTC Still hanging around the $105K area which is the middle of the monthly range and right at the monthly open. Price has been compressing and it&#8217;s clear that the market is waiting for a big move to occur. The statistics still heavily favor a further displacement this week and especially this month. So keep an eye on these levels and play accordingly. Bitcoin price trading within a tight range on the 4 hour chart.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bullish-wave-to-ath/",
      "summary": "Recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen Ethereum clawing back above $2,500 after a pullback that saw its price fall to a low of $2,440. This is a notable correction from Ethereum&#8217;s foray to $2,770 in the past seven-day timeframe, but according to crypto analyst KledjdiCuni, it aligns with one of the anticipated price scenarios. Now, the analyst&#8217;s outlook is of a reversal into a bullish wave. In his latest update, KlejdiCuni laid out several upside targets that traders may want to keep in focus if Ethereum confirms a breakout. Accumulation And Bullish Setup Toward $2,800 Breakout Crypto analyst KlejdiCuni, posting on the TradingView platform, believes Ethereum may now be on the verge of initiating a much larger bullish trend. According to his analysis, the $2,440 region held up as expected, confirming it as a strong accumulation zone. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Is Ready To Surge With Higher Lows Against Bitcoin, But There\u2019s A Caveat In the daily candlestick price chart he shared, KlejdiCuni illustrated what he identifies as a bullish pattern. This pattern is a formation of higher lows and relatively stable resistance near the upper boundary. This setup resembles an ascending channel structure, which suggests that buyers are gradually taking control of Ethereum&#8217;s price action. Ethereum&#8217;s rebound to $2,660 has formed a structure that could break above the current pattern, likely in the direction of $2,800. This aligns with the upper resistance boundary of the bullish pattern, and as such, it is the first immediate target to look towards for a breakout to higher price levels. Price Targets For Ethereum If Ethereum successfully breaks above the $2,800 resistance level, the bullish momentum could signal the start of the expected bullish trend, according to the analyst. In this case, the first major target in this sequence is $3,300. Ethereum&#8217;s reaction here would be one to watch, as it coincides with a resistance level in late January 2025 that eventually broke to the downside in early February 2025. If Ethereum manages to clear this zone, it would confirm a sustained buying interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke Should Ethereum maintain its upward pressure beyond $3,300, the next target is at $3,800. This level carries particular technical significance, as it coincides with an order block in early January that caused the initial rejection as it tried to push toward the $4,000 price level again. Breaking through $3,800 to the upside would be an indication that bullish sentiment has taken firm hold across higher timeframes again. Finally, if the bullish wave extends uninterrupted, the analyst projects a longer-term target of $4,500. This level is only a short distance from Ethereum\u2019s all-time high of around $4,878, and reaching it would represent a near-complete recovery from the prolonged bear market. Hitting $4,500 would also place Ethereum at new price highs for this cycle. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,521, having retraced by 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

The company didn\u2019t share how much it invested, but its support sends a strong message. It shows Ripple believes in XRPQ\u2019s structure and security, even after years of uncertainty about XRP in the US courts. Growth Of XRP Over A Decade Data from 2015 to now shows that XRP\u2019s price jumped to around 10,700%, climbing from $0.02 back then to $2.16 today.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-analyst-eyes-high-timeframe-close-range-break-above-2800-could-be-violent/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is currently facing a pivotal moment as it continues to consolidate below the $3,000 level. Bulls are targeting a breakout above this key resistance zone, which could trigger a major upward move. However, broader market conditions remain fragile. Geopolitical tensions\u2014particularly the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran\u2014continue to create a high-risk macroeconomic environment, leading to increased volatility and intermittent selling pressure across risk assets. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% Despite these challenges, ETH has shown resilience by holding above the $2,500 support zone. The price has remained locked in a narrow trading range for weeks, reflecting market indecision and caution among participants. According to a technical analysis shared by top analyst Daan, Ethereum continues to trade within this very tight range, with price wicks on both sides consistently getting absorbed. This type of price action signals growing compression, often a precursor to a strong directional move once one side gives in. Traders are now closely monitoring the structure for a higher timeframe close above $2,800, which could validate bullish momentum and open the path toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, the market appears balanced, and any shift in geopolitical developments may quickly tilt sentiment in either direction. Ethereum Prepares For Breakout as Market Awaits Confirmation Ethereum remains over 60% below its 2024 high of $4,100, but the asset is showing signs of recovery after months of downward pressure and indecision. Bulls have struggled to regain control throughout the year, but recent price action indicates the start of a potential rally. This recovery, however, remains tentative and will require confirmation through a higher timeframe close above critical resistance levels, particularly the $2,800\u2013$3,000 range. The broader environment continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. Escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty\u2014including rising U.S. Treasury yields and concerns about inflation\u2014are creating headwinds for risk assets, Ethereum included. Despite this, ETH has managed to hold key support above the $2,500 level, a sign that bulls are defending their ground. According to technical analysis shared by analyst Daan, Ethereum is currently trading within a very tight range, with price wicks on both sides being consistently absorbed. This type of compression typically signals an incoming surge in volatility. Daan notes that once one side gives in, the resulting move often becomes explosive and sustained. The current range-bound action reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers, but that balance won\u2019t last forever. Traders are watching closely for a decisive higher timeframe close above resistance\u2014or below support\u2014as confirmation of the next trend direction. With ETH positioned near major technical zones, a breakout could lead to significant momentum, potentially bringing Ethereum closer to reclaiming the psychological $3,000 mark and reigniting a push toward cycle highs. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low \u2013 No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Ethereum Continues Range-Bound Trading As Key Support Holds Ethereum (ETH) remains locked in a tight range between approximately $2,500 and $2,800, showing little directional clarity over the past several weeks. The chart above (12-hour timeframe) reflects persistent consolidation with multiple wicks on both ends of the candles, indicating absorption of both bullish and bearish momentum. This suggests that neither buyers nor sellers have taken firm control. ETH currently trades near $2,540 and is holding above the 100-period simple moving average (SMA), which is acting as short-term support. The 50 SMA has flattened, further reinforcing the sideways nature of the price action. Volume has also tapered off, typical in compression phases that often precede strong breakouts or breakdowns. If ETH fails to reclaim the $2,675\u2013$2,800 resistance zone, the 200 SMA near $2,117 may become relevant as a deeper support target. However, as long as ETH maintains price action above $2,500, bulls are still in play. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions \u2013 Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack The structure suggests that Ethereum is building energy for a decisive move. A higher timeframe close above $2,800 could trigger a new leg up toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a break below $2,500 could lead to renewed bearish pressure. For now, traders are watching for breakout confirmation. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-action-on-june-22/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price action is currently testing investors&#8217; nerves as it hovers around $100,000. While it flirts with this psychological level, analysts are highlighting June 22, 2025, as a key date for potential volatility. Backed by both historical volatility patterns and technical indicators, this date is gearing up to be a critical window for Bitcoin\u2019s next move. Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility On June 22 Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase as it trades above the $100,000 mark, with technical signals identified by TradingView expert \u2018readCrypto\u2019 aligning around a critical time frame\u2014-June 22. The chart analysis shows that June 22 is an important date, signaling the projected start of Bitcoin\u2019s next volatility window, with a potential to break out or break down depending on how the flagship cryptocurrency reacts to key support and resistance zones. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $104,731, close to a pivotal confluence range between $104,463 and $106,133\u2014a zone highlighted as a structural mid-point. This area is defined by the DOM (60) and a Heikin-Ashi high point on the price chart, marking the formation of a recent upper boundary. Moreover, the lower end of the range sits around $99,705, which is the HA-High support level, where the price has previously been tested but not yet broken. According to the analyst, the June 22 date is important because it coincides with the confluence of key price levels with the M-Signal indicator on the weekly chart. This indicator is currently rising and aligning near the $99,705 HA-high level. If Bitcoin falls below this level, it could signal the start of a deeper corrective move, possibly toward the monthly M-Signal line or even the $89,294 region, corresponding with the 2.618 Fibonacci. Conversely, if Bitcoin holds above this level and breaks out of the $108,316 resistance, momentum could shift back to the upside. The analyst has set upper bullish targets near $109,598 and $111,696, reflecting the final resistance zone before new highs. Support Zones And Momentum Indicate Tense Standoff Moving past readCrypto\u2019s volatility-driven projection, the TradingView analyst\u2019s Bitcoin chart shows that the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) oscillator remains below the zero line. This suggests that despite recent gains, selling pressure may still be dominating the broader market. However, the histogram in the chart shows signs of waning momentum on the sell side. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 This divergence aligns with Bitcoin\u2019s weakening Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates momentum may be cooling. The low OBV readings, combined with the recent bounce from a lower support range, also underscore an intense standoff within the market. If Bitcoin breaks below the Heikin Ashi high point at $99,705, a retest of new lows at $89,294 is more than likely. Until then, readCrypto\u2019s analysis shows that all eyes are on the $104,000 to $106,000 zone. The area between $99,705 and $108,316 now defines the high-boundary consolidation range. A confirmed move outside this range, mainly triggered during the June 21-13 window, could dictate Bitcoin\u2019s next major move. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"
