      "summary": "As the market sees a Friday retrace, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim a crucial area as support. An analyst suggests that the flagship crypto\u2019s daily close could set the stage for a bullish end of the week despite potential volatility. Related Reading: SUI Prepares For Bullish Flag Breakout Amid $3 Reclaim \u2013 Analyst Doubles The Target Bitcoin Breakout To Come \u2018Sooner Or Later\u2019 At the start of the new quarter, Bitcoin has retested crucial levels, touching the $105,000 support and $110,000 resistance over the past four days. Amid its Tuesday pullback, the flagship crypto fell to a two-week low but managed to bounce from a crucial range. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems previously noted that BTC needed a strong rebound from the \u201cmost important\u201d support and resistance area, between the $104,000 and $106,000 price levels, explaining that failing to hold this range would open the door for a drop to the range lows around $101,000. On Friday, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s price action after holding the key levels, which \u201cprovided the perfect entry for a bounce, just as expected.\u201d Following this performance, he asserted that Bitcoin is expanding on its two-month Power of Three (Po3) setup, signaling that potential further expansion is ahead. Nonetheless, he pointed out that the flagship crypto is still trading in a two-month range, suggesting a volatile price action until the price successfully breaks out, which it has attempted to do earlier this week. \u201cSince we are in a range, we are forced to respect the key levels of the range: high, mid, and low,\u201d Sjuul detailed, adding that all eyes are currently on the mid-range, where bulls must step in to confirm the bullish move to the range high. Based on this, the analyst forecasted another move above the $110,00 mark, where \u201cwe have left a lot of unfinished business\u201d and \u201cplenty of liquidity lies.\u201d He pointed to a huge cluster near the $111,000 area in BTC\u2019s Liquidity Heatmap, affirming that \u201cprice is attracted by liquidity, so I am expecting that level to be visited sooner or later.\u201d BTC Eyes Pivotal Closes After being rejected from the $108,000 at the start of the week, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin broke out of two 2-week downtrends in the past 40 days but was rejected from the crucial 6-week diagonal downtrend, around the $108,000 mark, during the same timeframe. This week, BTC closed above this resistance twice, and daily closed above the $109,000 mark on Thursday. However, Friday\u2019s pullback saw Bitcoin drop below the crucial level, falling to the $107,245 area. The analyst considers that a key retest of the pattern is in progress. He previously explained that any dipping into the top of Bitcoin\u2019s pattern could \u201ctechnically be considered additional retesting to further solidify the recently broken black diagonal resistance into new support.\u201d Nonetheless, BTC must close today above the diagonal resistance for a successful retest. \u201cBitcoin is losing the diagonal for the moment. But if price Daily Closes above the diagonal, then this will have ended as a downside wick as part of a volatile retest. Upcoming Daily Close will be pivotal,\u201d he stated. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 \u2013 Here Are The Levels To Watch Meanwhile, Bitcoin is also on the cusp of making history as its price nears the \u201cfinal major Weekly resistance\u201d around the $109,000. Rekt Capital detailed that if BTC closes above this level, it would confirm a break from this major resistance, which would likely unlock a new all-time high (ATH). He concluded that, with the recent weekend volatility, \u201cwe won&#8217;t know until the very last moment heading into the new Weekly Close whether this level has been flipped into support or not.\u201d Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu-news/shiba-inu-centralized-top-coins-62-just-10-wallets/",
      "summary": "On-chain data shows Shiba Inu (SHIB) has its supply more concentrated on the largest holders than other assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Pepe (PEPE). Shiba Inu Has 62% Of Its Supply Controlled By Top 10 Whales In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how some top coins currently compare against each other in terms of the percentage of supply held by the ten largest wallets on the respective networks. Below is a chart showing the trend in this metric for eight cryptocurrencies: Shiba Inu, Ethereum, Pepe, USDT, USDC, DAI, Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI). As is visible in the graph, the stablecoin USDC has the lowest amount of supply concentrated on the top 10 addresses among these assets at around 27%. Chainlink and DAI come close with the metric sitting at 32% and 33%, respectively. Others like Uniswap and Ethereum, however, have a more significant part of their supply under the control of these humongous entities: 51% and 49%, respectively. One asset that particularly stands out is Shiba Inu, with a massive 62% of its supply belonging to the ten largest whales on the network. For comparison, the other memecoin on the list, Pepe, has the same metric at 39%. Generally, the centralization of supply on just a few hands isn&#8217;t a constructive sign for any cryptocurrency&#8217;s stability, as tokens signify power on the network. It&#8217;s especially relevant in the case of a proof-of-stake (PoS) asset like Ethereum. As Santiment explains, As a retail trader, it&#8217;s generally safer to hold coins with less supply held by the most elite whales. There is less risk of sudden dumps or price manipulation should an asset&#8217;s largest whales decide to exit their positions. Given this, the assets like Ethereum, Uniswap, and Shiba Inu that currently have a majority of their supply or close to it in the hands of the top 10 whales may not be in the best position right now. In some other news, the cryptocurrency market sentiment is on the verge of extreme greed, according to the Fear &#38; Greed Index. The Fear &#38; Greed Index is an indicator created by Alternative that inputs a few different factors to determine the investor mentality as a score lying between zero and hundred. As displayed above, the cryptocurrency Fear &#38; Greed has a value of 73 at the moment. This corresponds to the presence of a strong sentiment of greed present among the traders. Historically, markets have often moved in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd. The probability of a contrary move is especially strong in the extreme ends of the index. For now, the market is still outside of the extreme greed zone, but only by a couple of units. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000115, up over 3% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, Alternative.me, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) is up 4.2% over the past seven days, trading in the mid-$2,500 range at the time of writing. Although the digital asset remains down 19% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, some analysts are optimistic that it\u2019s ready for a liftoff. Ethereum Enters Wyckoff \u2018Liftoff\u2019 Phase In an X post published today, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum appears to be following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern and has successfully cleared both the \u2018creek\u2019 and \u2018spring\u2019 phases, potentially entering the \u2018liftoff\u2019 phase characterized by parabolic price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge In the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, the \u2018creek\u2019 represents overhead resistance where price struggles to break higher, while the \u2018spring\u2019 is a false breakdown below support, meant to trap bears and confirm strong hands. The \u2018liftoff\u2019 phase follows the spring, marked by a sharp recovery and breakout above resistance, signaling the start of a new bullish trend. The analyst shared the following Ethereum daily chart, which shows the cryptocurrency on the verge of a potential breakout, with its next major resistance at the $3,700 level. A successful breakout and retest of this level could set the stage for a new all-time high (ATH). Fellow crypto analyst Crypto GEMs also pointed toward Ethereum getting ready for a significant move to the upside. The analyst shared the following chart which compares ETH\u2019s price action in 2025 to that in 2024. If Ethereum mirrors its 2024 performance, it could break above the $3,000 mark in the near term. However, not all analysts share this bullish outlook. For instance, noted crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a four-hour Ethereum chart showing the asset trading within a rising wedge pattern. He cautioned that unless ETH breaks out of this formation, it may face a drop to $2,200. To explain, a rising wedge pattern is a bearish chart formation where price moves upward within converging trendlines, indicating weakening bullish momentum. It often signals an upcoming breakdown, as buyers lose control and sellers push the price lower after the wedge is breached. ETH Network Sees Renewed Activity In a separate X post, crypto analyst CryptoGoos remarked that daily transactions on Ethereum are nearing ATH level for the first time since 2021. Typically, heightened network activity tends to precede major price movements. Analyst Crypto Rover echoed this view, noting that active addresses across the Ethereum network have hit a new all-time high. They added that ETH below $3,000 is &#8220;an absolute steal.&#8221; Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross On Daily Chart \u2013 Is A New ATH Within Reach?

      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s price action caught traders\u2019 attention this week. After dipping toward the $0.13\u2013$0.15 demand zone, the meme\u2011coin shot higher, and a surge in derivatives data suggests many expect more gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming Trader Interest Climbs Around $0.19 Resistance According to market data, Open Interest jumped by 16% to reach over $2 billion. Options volume exploded by 400%. That kind of rise often points to big bets on upward swings. Right now, many eyes are on the $0.20 resistance level. If DOGE can close a daily candle above that line, it may clear the way toward $0.27. Dogecoin\u2019s technical setup is drawing fresh looks from chart watchers. The Stochastic RSI crossed above 80, which can mark an overbought zone. Yet coins have stayed above overbought readings before when buyers kept pushing. Traders will want to see real volume behind any move above that descending trendline near $0.19. Without it, the rally may stall or give back gains. Whales Return With Spot Inflows Based on reports, Dogecoin saw a net inflow of $8.20 million into spot wallets. That marks a big shift after weeks of outflows. Large holders have been moving coins onto exchanges in the past, but now they\u2019re pulling more in. In other cycles, fresh whale buys have lined up with mid\u2011term rallies. On\u2011chain metrics add another layer. Dogecoin\u2019s MVRV Z\u2011score climbed back to 0.355 after hitting near\u2011historical lows late in June. That figure measures how much profit holders stand to make on average. A rising score hints that fewer holders are underwater, and that might draw in new buyers. Still, MVRV is backward\u2011looking. It can\u2019t predict if price will break through key resistance. Network Activity Shows Mixed Signals Network stats tell a mixed story. Daily active addresses slid to 34 K, and transaction counts dropped to 15K as of July 3. That\u2019s a sharp fall from the more than 500K addresses and transactions seen in the last week of June. Lower usage could sap the rally\u2019s legs if retail traders don\u2019t reengage soon. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Even with these mixed signals, the mood toward Dogecoin is brighter than it was a week ago.

      "summary": "Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $13.36, following a 3% drop in the past 24 hours, which places the altcoin approximately 74% below its all-time high of $52.70, recorded in May. Despite this short-term dip, LINK has held onto weekly gains of around 2.4%, suggesting broader market participants may still be weighing its long-term potential. While price remains rangebound, recent on-chain data indicates that LINK\u2019s price action could be the result of diverging behavior between retail and institutional investors. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move Holds The Key Chainlink Institutional Accumulation and Supply Pressure CryptoQuant contributor \u201cBanker\u201d highlighted a growing structural dynamic in the LINK ecosystem in a recent QuickTake analysis titled \u201cLINK\u2019s Accumulation Standoff: Whales Build, Retail Waits.\u201d The report outlines how LINK is currently in a consolidation phase between $12 and $15, where institutional actors have been steadily accumulating tokens, while retail users remain largely passive. This discrepancy may be playing a key role in capping upward momentum despite persistent LINK outflows from centralized exchanges. According to Banker, exchange netflows for LINK have remained negative at roughly -100,000 LINK per week, signaling that more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This behavior is typically associated with accumulation activity, particularly from larger holders or \u201cwhales\u201d who may be positioning for longer-term appreciation. Historical spikes in retail deposits, such as the +5 million LINK deposited in March 2025, have proven to be exceptions rather than the norm, as retail activity has since remained subdued. Supporting this view, active LINK addresses have hovered consistently between 28,000 and 32,000 per day, while transaction counts average around 9,000 daily. These figures have not rebounded from previous activity peaks seen in late 2024, even as Chainlink\u2019s oracle usage has expanded. Meanwhile, elevated levels of exchange withdrawals, peaking at over 3,000 per day in Q4 2024, remain a dominant force. With leverage metrics staying neutral, whales have been able to withdraw LINK without introducing significant price volatility, resulting in a 40% year-to-date drop in exchange reserves. Market Outlook Hinges on Retail Reentry or Whale Fatigue As LINK\u2019s consolidation persists, the path forward may depend on a shift in market dynamics. Banker points out that a meaningful breakout will likely require renewed participation from retail traders, as evidenced by a spike in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals \u2018Opportunity\u2019 If these metrics rise and price breaks above the $15 price mark, momentum could build for a stronger upward trend. On the other hand, a decline in whale-driven withdrawals or an increase in exchange inflows could weaken accumulation, potentially pushing LINK back down toward the $10 level. Banker added: Until catalysts emerge, whales silently build positions, echoing Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 consolidation before its 2024 surge. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"
