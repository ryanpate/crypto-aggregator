      "summary": "As volatility engulfs the cryptocurrency market amid war tensions, on-chain data shows that the Bitcoin short-term holders are selling at a loss. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Just Made Large Exchange Inflows At A Loss In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about how the Bitcoin short-term holders have reacted to the price volatility that has come alongside rising tensions in the Middle East following US strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The other side of the network, the holders with a holding time greater than 155 days, are termed as the long-term holders (LTHs). The former group contains the new entrants and low conviction holders, who generally panic easily whenever some change occurs in the market. On the other hand, the latter cohort includes the veterans of the market, who tend to sit tight through crashes and rallies alike. As such, given the recent sharp price action that has occurred in the sector, the STHs are likely to have made some moves. And indeed, on-chain data would confirm so. The above chart, shared by the analyst, shows the data for the profit and loss exchange deposit transactions that the STHs as a whole are making. Investors usually transfer to these centralized platforms when they want to sell, so inflows going to them can provide hints about whether selling is elevated or not. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the loss transactions going to the exchanges from this cohort have amounted to 14,700 BTC, which, although lower than the two major capitulation events from the past couple of months, is significant. Thus, it would appear that some of the STHs have reacted to the news by exiting the market, even if it means taking a loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move\u2014Will It Be Up Or Down? It&#8217;s also apparent from the chart that the profitable transfers have remained relatively low at 3,100 BTC. This is likely down to the fact that the STHs are left with little profit following the price decline, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. In the chart, the trend of the STH Realized Price is displayed. This indicator keeps track of the Bitcoin cost basis or acquisition level of the average STH. During the crash, the price almost retested the line, and even after the rebound, it remains close to it, meaning the profit margin for the cohort is still tight. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $101,300, down over 5% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "The BNB Paradox: Bearish Breakdown Meets Bullish Flag, Which Will Prevail?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-bearish-breakdown/",
      "summary": "BNB finds itself at a pivotal crossroads where conflicting signals collide \u2014 a bearish breakdown challenging key support levels, yet a bullish flag pattern hints at a potential upward surge. This paradox leaves traders and investors weighing which force will ultimately dominate the market\u2019s next move. As pressure mounts from both sides, understanding the technical nuances behind this tug-of-war becomes crucial to anticipating BNB\u2019s trajectory in the near term. BNB Faces Pressure From Key Technical Levels Analyzing the BNBUSD setup on the M30 timeframe, Thomas Anderson in an X post highlighted that the price is currently testing the yellow support line at $626.95, following a decisive drop below the cyan price line at $633.99. This breakdown has shifted short-term sentiment, suggesting that sellers are beginning to exert stronger control over the price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Breakout Could Trigger ATH Rally Repeat \u2013 Is $730 The Next Stop? According to Anderson, the 200 MA (red line), positioned between $642 and $645, is now acting as a dynamic resistance zone overhead. With price trading below this moving average, any attempts at recovery may face immediate rejection. He also pointed out that the H1 chart confirms the ongoing bearish momentum, with the price continuing to trade below both the cyan level and the 200 MA. This alignment between the M30 and H1 timeframes strengthens the case for further downside movement, especially if the current support at $626.95 fails to hold. Until buyers manage to reclaim key resistance levels, the overall outlook remains weak, and traders should keep an eye on how the price behaves around the current support to gauge the next likely move. BNB\u2019s Price Outlook Strengthened By Bullish Continuation Signal Despite the bearish outlook presented by Thomas Anderson, eL Zippo expressed a more optimistic stance in his latest X tweet regarding BNB. He believes that BNB still has the potential to rise in value, challenging the prevailing negative sentiment around its recent price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Eyes Comeback: Can It Regain Momentum and Rally Higher? EL Zippo\u2019s view is supported by the formation of a bullish flag pattern on the chart. This pattern is widely recognized as a continuation signal, indicating that the asset may resume its prior upward trend after a period of consolidation. For eL Zippo, the presence of this structure suggests that BNB could be setting up for another leg higher if market conditions align. At the time of writing, BNB was trading around the $623 mark, reflecting steady price action. The asset\u2019s market capitalization stood at approximately $87.7 billion, signaling strong investor interest. Additionally, BNB recorded a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $1.8 billion, with price and volume showing percentage gains of 2.11% and 13.22%, respectively\u2014an indication of renewed activity and positive sentiment in the market.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-risk-20-crash-to-1-55/",
      "summary": "XRP has once again landed at an important support level that places it in view of a rebound upwards or at risk of a further 20% crash. According to technical analyst CasiTrades, the recent drop was anticipated for weeks, and the precision with which XRP touched the $2.01 zone has added weight to its importance. The analyst noted that the drop out of the symmetrical triangle consolidation was clean and technically sound, and the $2.01 level has so far acted as the level for an upward bounce. Technical Setup Says Danger Zone Below $2.00 Still Active XRP price action in the past few days has been marked by a downtrend. XRP lost the $2.13 price level over the weekend before eventually cascading to a crash below $2 in the past 24 hours. Particularly, XRP crashed to bottom out at $1.92 before staging a rebound back above $2, at least at the time of writing. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move Coming? As it stands, XRP is now back to trading at $2.01, a price level that holds utmost importance for its price action in the coming days. According to a technical analysis posted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst CasiTrades, $2.01 is important for XRP, as it coincides with a major 0.618 Fib support level. Supporting this view is a visible bullish divergence forming on both the 15-minute and 1-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI), as depicted on the price chart below. However, the analyst was quick to warn that confirmation is still lacking on the higher 4-hour and daily timeframes. Without these confirmations, the bounce could still be nonexistent, and XRP could crash strongly below $2. XRP is currently at risk unless buyers manage to push its price into higher confirmation zones, specifically into the $3.00 range. According to CasiTrades, if any bounce at $2.01 fails to carry through, XRP could be headed for its next supports at $1.90 and then $1.55. The latter represents a rough 23% drop from current levels, a scenario that would invalidate the bullish RSI divergence on the smaller timeframes. Geopolitical Tensions Causing XRP Price Volatility The timing of XRP\u2019s sharp drop over the weekend coincided with reports of geopolitical unrest, particularly the reported bombing of Iran by the US. This event caused widespread volatility in the crypto market, which was opened over the weekend. Related Reading: Why The XRP Price Risks A Crash To $0.9 As Bearish Pressures Mount Although the decline seems to be pausing in recent trading hours, it does not yet qualify as a bounce. XRP price is currently fragile, and without a reaction from buyers or confirmation across higher timeframes, the structure is bearish. Selling pressure from new geopolitical tensions or algorithmic moves could potentially lead to deeper declines during the new week, especially if $2.00 fails to hold. In that case, XRP could be on track to retest the $1.90 support and even collapse toward the $1.55 before the end of the week. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.01, down by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "title": "Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-crash-far-from-over-analyst/",
      "summary": "The price of Dogecoin continues to bleed, and crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) warns that the worst may still lie ahead. Citing an earlier bearish pattern, Kevin emphasized over the weekend that Dogecoin\u2019s Head and Shoulders formation\u2014identified nearly two weeks ago\u2014is rapidly approaching its technical \u201cmeasured move\u201d target. But he also made it clear that the full downside potential has not yet played out. Dogecoin Collapse Far From Over? \u201cI didn\u2019t say we are there now,\u201d Kevin clarified in a follow-up post, \u201cthe orange circle represents a zone of where the measured move could go, with a precise measured move target of the .786 fib at .119.\u201d This $0.119 level aligns with a broader confluence of technical supports that are quickly becoming critical for DOGE\u2019s structure. \u201cThe Head n Shoulders I pointed out on Dogecoin almost a couple of weeks ago is almost at its measured move target range. Certain daily indicators are also starting to enter inciting levels. Watching closely along with BTC and USDT Dominance for further confirmations,\u201d he wrote. Kevin also highlighted the importance of the weekly 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), along with the macro .382 Fibonacci retracement and a long-term descending trendline. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $4 Dogecoin After Exhausted Selling Phase Together, these levels form what he described as the \u201cmust-hold\u201d zone, specifically between $0.1434 and $0.1265. A sustained breakdown below that region would likely confirm a macro bearish shift for the meme asset. What To Monitor Now Zooming out, Kevin sees Dogecoin\u2019s fate as inseparably tied to Bitcoin and the wider altcoin market, which he describes as being in its weakest state in years. \u201cSo far 2025 has been more bearish for altcoins than 2024 and 2023,\u201d he noted. \u201cWorst year for Alts since the bear market in 2022.\u201d The overwhelming strength of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been a key factor in that trend. That dominance, Kevin argues, is not a temporary spike. \u201cFresh highs for BTC Dominance on the back of restrictive monetary policy and an uncertain geopolitical environment,\u201d he wrote, referring to global macro conditions including persistent quantitative tightening (QT). He has long warned that without a pivot in central bank policy, any talk of a true \u201caltseason\u201d is premature. Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like \u2018It Wants To Play Dead\u2019\u2014Again \u201cBeen saying since late 2023, early 2024\u2014when AI coins were running crazy and people were saying it was #Altseason\u2014that until QT ends and the terminal rate comes down, you will not see real sustainable altcoin outperformance. That continues to hold true.\u201d His caution extends well beyond Dogecoin. In previous posts, Kevin identified key danger zones for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which he argues must be reclaimed to prevent broader market deterioration. \u201cAs long as BTC cannot break the $106.8K level and show real follow-through on 3D-1W time frames, then the market is in real danger,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSame for ETH not being able to break the $2700-2800 level.\u201d For Dogecoin traders, the message is clear. The meme coin\u2019s fate rests not just on its own technical health, but on a wider macro and intermarket structure that remains fragile. As long as Bitcoin struggles to hold above key breakout levels and US monetary conditions remain tight, the probability of a deeper Dogecoin correction remains high. Whether DOGE can stabilize above the $0.1265 level will be closely watched by traders in the days and weeks ahead. A loss of that zone, especially in conjunction with renewed Bitcoin weakness, could mark the beginning of a deeper and more painful phase for the once-beloved meme coin. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.152. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-battles-key-support-daily-ema-100-must-hold-to-prevent-deep-correction/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin briefly fell below the critical $100,000 level over the weekend, reaching a low of approximately $98,200 and triggering a wave of panic selling across crypto markets. The sharp drop came after news broke of US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move that significantly escalated the already volatile conflict between Israel and Iran. The geopolitical shock sent global markets into risk-off mode, with Bitcoin reacting quickly to the growing uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure \u2013 Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 Despite the weekend dip, BTC has since reclaimed the $100K mark, but sentiment remains fragile. Investors are now watching key technical levels closely to determine the next move. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Bitcoin must hold the daily EMA-100 to avoid further downside pressure. A decisive close below this level could open the door for a deeper correction, especially if macroeconomic and geopolitical risks persist. As volatility spikes and fear grows, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to maintain support at these levels may define whether the bull cycle continues or enters a prolonged consolidation phase. All eyes are now on the $100K zone, which has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears in a market driven by both technicals and global tension. Bulls Defend $100K As Dominance Rises and Market Faces Crucial Test Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal moment. After dipping below the psychological $100,000 level over the weekend amid growing geopolitical tensions, BTC quickly reclaimed this critical threshold, offering a glimmer of hope to market participants. Although bulls managed to push the price back up, the overall structure remains fragile, and technical indicators now carry more weight than ever. Ted Pillows noted in a recent update that Bitcoin must hold its daily EMA-100 to preserve bullish momentum. A daily close below $99,000 would confirm a break below this key support zone, likely triggering a retest of the $92,000\u2013$94,000 region. Such a move could create significant downside pressure, particularly on altcoins, which are already lagging behind in performance. In Pillows&#8217; words, \u201cIf Bitcoin loses this level, alts will be annihilated.\u201d Despite the looming risks, fundamentals remain solid. Bitcoin dominance continues to hover near its highest levels of the year, reflecting growing investor preference for BTC over high-beta assets during uncertain times. On-chain metrics still indicate strong holder conviction, and macro narratives continue to favor Bitcoin as a hedge amid fiat instability and rising geopolitical uncertainty. If Bitcoin can hold the $100K level and reclaim momentum, it could lead to renewed strength and eventually a push toward the $109K resistance zone. For now, however, bulls are on the defensive. Price action over the next few days will likely define the trajectory for the remainder of Q3, with a close watch on EMA support, macro headlines, and risk sentiment across global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Chart Nears Tower Top Formation As US Launches Attack On Iran \u2013 Details Bitcoin Struggles Below Resistance Amid Bearish Price Structure The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin reveals a bearish structure following the breakdown below the $103,600 support zone. After forming a symmetrical triangle throughout mid-June, BTC failed to break upward and instead reversed direction, confirming a downward breakout. This move triggered a sharp decline to $98,200 over the weekend, followed by a modest recovery to the current $101,250 level. The price is now trading below both the 50 and 100-period simple moving averages, which are beginning to curl downward, signaling a shift in momentum away from bulls. The 200-period SMA, currently near $95,600, stands as the next major support if downside pressure continues. Volume has picked up notably on the red candles, adding weight to the bearish case and confirming active selling during the recent drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move Bitcoin must reclaim the $103,600 zone and hold above it to invalidate the bearish pattern and regain control. Failure to do so could result in further downside toward $95,000 and possibly even $92,000. As long as BTC remains below the broken triangle support and the $103K resistance, the path of least resistance remains downward. Bulls face an uphill battle, and confidence may erode quickly if the $100K psychological level is breached again. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
