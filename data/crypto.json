      "summary": "According to a recent analytics, stablecoins handled 35 trillion in on-chain transaction volume over the past year, with their average supply hovering around 195 billion. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears Those numbers show how much these tokens fuel trades, loans and cross-border transfers. Yet questions about whether they really count as \u201cmoney\u201d are now front and center. Stablecoin On-Chain Traffic Based on reports, stablecoins have become the workhorses of crypto trading. Volume hit 35 trillion in the last 12 months. At the same time, their circulating supply stayed at 194.6 billion. That steady supply suggests tokens like USDC and USDT are parked, ready for the next move. Traders shift them in and out of Bitcoin and altcoins. Payment platforms weave them into digital rails. The scale is hard to ignore. IMF Deputy MD Raises Money Question According to IMF Deputy Managing Director Bo Li, the big challenge is classification. Are stablecoins part of M0, M1 or a new category altogether? He posed those questions at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos. Getting that wrong could reshape how banks set reserves and how regulators cut red tape. Li also pointed out that policy experiments are popping up all over. Some of them may not survive a real stress test. Key Takeaways: IMF\u2019s Bo Li said regulatory uncertainty around stablecoins persists, especially regarding classification and enforcement.

Europe has drafted its own rulebook. Over in Asia, Hong Kong plans to roll out its Stablecoin Ordinance in August 2025. Those efforts show a strong push to make rules more clear. But they also underscore a lack of global unity. Businesses could face one set of rules in New York, another in Brussels and a third in Hong Kong. That patchwork approach risks adding costs for firms and confusion for users. Global Bodies Seek Cooperation According to Bo Li\u2019s remarks, fragmented rules carry real risks. He warned that gaps in enforcement might let bad actors slip through. To avoid that, the IMF is teaming up with the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee. Their goal is to craft more consistent guidance. If they pull it off, regulators in different countries might follow a shared playbook rather than compete by cutting corners.

      "title": "Ethereum Daily Transactions Just Hit Its Highest Level Since January 2024, Will Price Follow?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-daily-transactions/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has seen a notable spike in its daily transactions after a week filled with uncertain market movement. While the rise in the daily transactions has caught attention, what is really essential to point out is that it has been a long time since the daily transactions have been this high. In fact, the spike has led to the highest level that Ethereum&#8217;s daily transactions have been in over 16 months, showing a return to the blockchain that seemed previously abandoned. Ethereum Daily Transactions Cross 1.7 Million According to data from the on-chain data aggregation website, Nansen, the Ethereum daily transaction count has spiked by almost 50% over the last few days. The week had begun with the daily transaction count sitting at 1.2 million on Monday. However, by Wednesday, this figure was already changing rapidly to reach new yearly peaks. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place As the Ethereum price rose above $2,400, so did participation on the blockchain, leading daily transactions to rise to 1.729 million. This sharp spike has led to the highest level so far in 2025, and is the first time since January 2024 that the daily transactions has crossed the 1.7 million mark. At the same time, there was also an unusual spike in the daily active addresses, which rose by almost 50% as well in the same time period. The daily active addresses rose from 345,406 addresses to 593,637 addresses in the space of four days. All of these have happened as the Ethereum price has recovered, suggesting that the spike in on-chain participation is actually more from investors buying than selling. If this trend continues, then it could send the Ethereum price soaring higher from here. Sell Volume Begins Dominating ETH Price In contrast to the rise in Ethereum on-chain participation, there has also been an increase in the on-chain sell volume compared to the buy volume. Nansen data points out that in the $168.37 million on-chain buy volume recorded in a 24-hour period, approximately $78.15 million was going toward buys, while a little over $90 million was from sellers. Related Reading: Ethereum Not Out Of The Woods Yet: Why Another 30% Crash To $1,800 Is Coming Furthermore, when it comes to individual transactions involved in buying and selling Ethereum, the sellers remain in the lead. There were more than 52,000 buy transactions recorded during this period, with around 24,300 buyers. While the sell transactions ran up towards 74,000, with sellers at more than 32,000. This shows a higher percentage of sellers compared to buyers, which would explain why the price has been unable to reach other support levels. This rise in the selling volume suggests that the buys are not enough to absorb the selling volume. This could fight off any buying momentum that could lead to a price recovery and keep the Ethereum price down while the crypto market struggles to find its footing.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-network-is-heating-up-while-price-stalls-is-a-breakout-coming/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is currently trading in a period of subdued price movement, reflecting broader consolidation across the crypto asset market. At the time of writing, ETH is trading around $2,423, marking a slight 0.9% daily decrease and standing more than 50% below its all-time high of $4,878. This stagnation has coincided with a broader lack of catalysts to drive a sustained rally, leaving traders cautious about Ethereum&#8217;s near-term trajectory. Despite this lack of price momentum, network activity on Ethereum tells a different story. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level \u2013 Bullish Continuation In Focus Ethereum On-Chain Metrics Point to Increased Network Engagement According to CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alem\u00e1n, the number of confirmed transactions on the Ethereum network recently spiked to 1,750,940, making it the third-highest daily transaction count in its history. Alem\u00e1n notes this trend may signal underlying usage strength, even as market participants wait for a more significant price response. Alem\u00e1n\u2019s analysis focuses on Ethereum\u2019s \u201cTransaction Count (Total)\u201d metric, which captures all forms of activity, including ETH transfers, smart contract executions, and interactions with decentralized applications and DeFi protocols. The recent surge reverses a months-long downtrend and represents the highest transaction count since January 14, when Ethereum recorded 1.96 million transactions. According to Alem\u00e1n, this spike may be driven by increased arbitrage, trading activity, and interactions with Layer 2 networks, which continue to absorb substantial transaction volume. Platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism remain key contributors to Ethereum\u2019s broader usage. He further points out that, despite ETH price volatility within the $2,100\u2013$2,880 range in recent weeks, the uptick in network traffic may hint at early-stage accumulation or renewed DeFi interest. This dynamic, while not immediately reflected in the asset\u2019s valuation, suggests that Ethereum\u2019s core infrastructure continues to see meaningful use. Speculative Behavior and Exchange Flows Raise Short-Term Concerns Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst, Amr Taha, has examined Ethereum\u2019s recent technical setup from a derivatives market perspective. Taha highlights that ETH funding rates on Binance have shifted from negative to positive territory, a sign that leveraged long positions are building, which may reflect expectations of continued price upside. However, this shift also raises the potential for overextension, particularly if longs begin to dominate positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears \u2013 Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout Taha also references a recent retest of a key short-squeeze zone, during which market participants who had shorted ETH were forced to close positions, triggering rapid buy orders. Such moves can generate short-term surges, but they\u2019re often followed by correction phases once speculative energy fades. Meanwhile, exchange data showed more than 177,000 ETH deposited on Binance over three days, indicating potential sell pressure or repositioning by large holders.

      "summary": "Bitcoin is treading cautiously below the $110,000 level, signaling a pause in momentum after recent highs. At the time of writing, the asset is priced at $106,841, marking a mild 0.4% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite brushing a daily high of $107,884, BTC appears to be consolidating in a narrow range, with market participants watching for the next significant move. Amid this relatively flat price action, on-chain trends suggest that not all is quiet under the surface. A new analysis by CryptoQuant contributor \u201coinonen\u201d sheds light on wallet activity within Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction Bitcoin Mid-Tier Investors Take Center Stage on Binance Oinonen&#8217;s findings point to a sharp increase in whale-level participation, as well as a notable contribution from mid-tier investors, which could have implications for broader market behavior. Citing CryptoQuant\u2019s on-chain metrics, the analyst revealed that Binance\u2019s inflow data shows that wallets depositing between 10 and 100 BTC now account for 40% of all Bitcoin inflows. These wallet sizes typically belong to high-net-worth individuals, trading firms, or mid-sized institutions\u2014those who sit between retail traders and deep-pocketed whales. In contrast, whale-level inflows (100\u20131,000 BTC) currently represent 20% of the total, highlighting that mid-tier players may be driving more exchange activity than larger whales at this time. Interestingly, whale activity still made a major appearance recently. On June 16, inflows of 10,000 BTC surged and made up 83% of total exchange inflows on Binance that day, reinforcing earlier observations from Oinonen about increased whale presence over the past year. According to CryptoQuant\u2019s whale ratio metric, that presence has reportedly jumped by as much as 400% since mid-2023. Binance Deposit Data Points to Rising Institutional Interest Beyond just inflow ratios, Binance\u2019s overall deposit metrics suggest a growing trend of larger average deposits. The average Bitcoin deposit rose from 0.36 BTC in 2023 to 1.65 BTC in 2024. The exchange processed $21.6 billion in user fund deposits in 2024, roughly 40% more than the combined totals of the next ten crypto exchanges. Despite the growing institutional footprint, the significant portion of deposits in the 10\u2013100 BTC range shows that mid-level market participants remain active contributors to the trading ecosystem. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer This data may reflect a broader shift in how BTC is being accumulated and moved, where influence is shared between whales and mid-sized investors. While whale flows often generate headlines, the consistent presence of mid-tier wallets can signal healthier market participation and a more distributed form of liquidity provision across the board. With Bitcoin still consolidating near key price levels, these on-chain trends could help shape its next breakout, whenever it comes. Featured image created with DALL-E. Chart from TradingView"
