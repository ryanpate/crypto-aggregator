      "summary": "Crypto analyst XForce has again alluded to the 5-Wave count to show when the XRP Price is likely to hit a new all-time high (ATH) above $5. As part of his analysis, the analyst also declared that there is no reason to be bearish on the altcoin at the moment. XRP To Rally Above $5 Based On 5-Wave Count In an X post, XForce shared an accompanying chart that showed that XRP could rally above $5 on the Wave 3 impulsive move to the upside. The altcoin could even rally to double digits and touch $13 on this move. The chart also showed that XRP will reach this target by year-end or early next year. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move Coming? Based on the 5-Wave count, XRP will then witness a price correction to around $5 on Wave 4 before it then rallies to around $25 on Wave 5, an impulsive move to the upside. XForce is confident that the current price action is going according to plan. He noted that the macro direction was met with very little margin of error. Furthermore, the crypto analyst remarked that everything from the Wave 4 triangle breakout to the anticipated 1 to 2 pullback following the 5-wave impulse followed the blueprint. In line with this, he declared that there is no valid reason to adopt a bearish stance unless the market invalidates the bullish case for XRP. XForce also affirmed that XRP is within the bounds of the same two scenarios but that the ultra-bullish scenario of a rally to double digits is gaining more credibility by the day. The more conservative scenario for the altcoin is a rally to $4, which could still mark a new all-time high for XRP. The analyst earlier declared that all scenarios on the medium timeframe still show the altcoin reaching a new ATH in this market cycle. XRP Consolidation Has Reached Its Peak In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and that something big is coming next. She remarked that the altcoin could either record an explosive breakout or see one final sharp drop to support that ignites a breakout. Either way, XRP looks likely to rally to the upside soon. Related Reading: XRP Price At $27: Guardian Arch Formation Predictions 1,000% Move CasiTrades stated that the XRP price continues to struggle with the $2.25 level. As long as this level remains resistance, she claimed that it increases the likelihood of the altcoin dropping to support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and even $1.55. However, the analyst declared that these aren\u2019t bearish targets but momentum zones, where the market grabs the liquidity it needs to build momentum for Wave 3. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-purest-ai-trade-wall-street-veteran/",
      "summary": "Macro investor Jordi Visser has published a Substack essay arguing that Bitcoin is \u201cthe purest AI trade,\u201d a claim he says has followed him \u201cin nearly every one of my videos, Substack posts, and conversations with Anthony Pompliano.\u201d The piece, released yesterday under the title You Don\u2019t Find Bitcoin, Bitcoin Finds You: Why It\u2019s the Purest AI Trade, sets out a personal and macro-economic narrative that Visser believes binds artificial-intelligence disruption to the rise of the world\u2019s first decentralised digital asset. Visser, who now heads AI Macro Nexus Research at 22V Research after three decades trading derivatives at Morgan Stanley, running a global-macro hedge fund, and ultimately serving as president and CIO of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, frames the essay as a pre-emptive answer to critics who \u201cdon\u2019t see it or understand it.\u201d \u201cThis statement wasn\u2019t born from a single insight but rather a journey that unfolded across three distinct steps and four accelerating forces that helped me connect the dots between monetary policy, exponential innovation, and a world shifting faster than our corporate, financial, and government systems can handle,\u201d he writes. The three steps, he explains, were \u201cpersonal awakening, macro-economic context, and the recognition of Bitcoin as foundational infrastructure for the digital economy.\u201d Why Bitcoin Is The Ultimate AI Trade The four forces Visser identifies as central to his thesis span the domains of monetary policy, technology, and sovereignty. The first, he writes, is \u201cunprecedented fiscal and monetary intervention which I believe marked the final climax of the global government debt super-cycle and ultimately the dollar as the global reserve currency.\u201d In his view, the pandemic-era explosion in government spending exposed the limits of fiat systems propped up by central bank liquidity. Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin Now? Not Yet\u2014Analyst Says Time Holds The Key The second force centers on structural deflation: \u201cdeflationary pressure from exponential technologies.\u201d Visser sees AI and automation as not just economic disruptors but forces that drive prices downward across the board\u2014pressuring legacy systems built on perpetual inflation and debt. The third pillar of his argument is institutional erosion. \u201cAccelerating institutional obsolescence through AI,\u201d he warns, will hollow out bureaucracies and corporate incumbents that are too slow to adapt to exponential change. Finally, Visser cites \u201cBitcoin\u2019s emergence as a sovereign digital asset\u2014independent, decentralised, and not defined by any nation-state.\u201d In contrast to fiat currencies reliant on state power and monetary intervention, Bitcoin exists as an autonomous, verifiable infrastructure layer for the digital economy. Visser dates his \u201cpersonal awakening\u201d to early 2021, when the pandemic-era money print collided with a household epiphany: \u201cAsset prices jumped and crypto prices were rising daily, and I was struck by the fact that my 13-year-old son \u2026 could explain the space in a way that I could not understand.\u201d That curiosity pushed him toward Michael Saylor\u2019s corporate-treasury bet on Bitcoin and Paul Tudor Jones\u2019s description of the asset as \u201cthe fastest horse in the race,\u201d convincing him that \u201cBitcoin [was] a rational response to an irrational system looking for a new one.\u201d The second intellectual milestone came through Jeff Booth\u2019s book The Price of Tomorrow, from which Visser lifts the line: \u201cInnovation is always deflationary for the economy so the baseline for inflation is always negative.\u201d Booth\u2019s argument, he says, revealed \u201can Economic Trilemma\u201d in which a debt-laden industrial economy can only survive by tapping government balance-sheets, even as a capital-light digital economy accelerates away. The result, he warns, is a fragile fiat system propped up by \u201cartificially low rates, quantitative easing, and fiscal stimulus\u201d that cannot be maintained indefinitely. Visser\u2019s third pivot came with Marc Andreessen\u2019s 2014 essay Why Bitcoin Matters. Andreessen\u2019s framing of the Bitcoin white paper as a monetary protocol\u2014\u201con par with the creation of the internet itself\u201d\u2014convinced Visser to stop viewing Bitcoin as a challenger to sovereign currency and start seeing it as \u201cthe base-layer for a new, decentralised economic system.\u201d Stablecoins, he concedes, may bridge fiat and crypto, but they remain \u201ctethered to the very institutions they\u2019re trying to outrun.\u201d Related Reading: $150,000 Bitcoin Is In Play\u2014Unless This One Macro Metric Snaps The final, self-described \u201cforce\u201d is AI itself: \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve said software is eating the world. But now, AI is eating software and soon it will eat everything in its path.\u201d He argues that intelligent agents will erode the scarcity premia that support most legacy assets, leaving Bitcoin\u2014algorithmically finite and independent of any issuer\u2014as \u201csovereignty at digital scale.\u201d In one of the essay\u2019s bleakest forecasts he writes, \u201cAI will destroy everything eventually\u2014not maliciously, but systematically. And the economic system we\u2019ve built on top of scarcity, debt, and centralisation is not equipped to survive it.\u201d Visser closes by channelling Saylor\u2019s mantra\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t find Bitcoin, Bitcoin finds you\u201d\u2014to explain why adoption is emerging first in the periphery: retail investors in emerging markets, smaller firms outcompeted by big-tech AI monopolies, and early-mover states such as El Salvador. \u201cThis bottom-up foundation is setting the stage for a future top-down capital rotation as FOMO and greed eventually force more and more of the doubters in,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThat\u2019s why Bitcoin is, in many ways, the purest AI trade\u2014an opt-out of a system being reshaped by intelligence no one fully controls.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent climb to $105,000 has done little to shake off the worries piling up around its momentum. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency eked out a 0.03% gain in the last 24 hours but still sits 3.5% lower than it did a week ago. According to analyst Captain Faibik, this mix of flat gains and fading strength could mean traders are buying Bitcoin at the top. Related Reading: Iran\u2019s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links\u2014Details Bearish RSI Divergence Signals Weakness Based on data, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has drifted downward after peaking near 80, even as Bitcoin\u2019s price pushed to fresh highs. The RSI now sits at 61.88, a clear sign that buyers are losing steam. Traders often watch for this kind of mismatch\u2014when price goes up but RSI goes down\u2014because it can spell a coming pullback. History shows it doesn\u2019t always lead to a crash, but it does make a correction more likely. After carving out fresh highs, it feels like Bitcoin has hit its ceiling, according to Fabik, and a pullback into the $92,000\u2013$94,000 zone could be on the cards. This setup usually sparks a quick correction, so many traders will be watching closely and tightening up their strategies as the market could shift in a hurry. $BTC is showing a massive RSI Bearish divergence on the weekly chart..!! It looks like Bitcoin has topped out and is now Ready for a major correction toward the 92\u201394k Range..\ud83d\udcc9 Just like it bottomed out at 16k in November 2022, We bought the dip and now we\u2019re selling the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/W25HCAxkIa \u2014 Captain Faibik \ud83d\udc3a (@CryptoFaibik) June 18, 2025 Resistance Levels Keep Price In Check Bitcoin has bumped into stiff barriers around $108,000 and $109,000, both set on May 19. An ascending trendline from December 2024 has also been capping gains for weeks. These levels are proving tough to clear. If Bitcoin can\u2019t break through soon, sellers may step in. Faibik points out that hitting these walls and seeing RSI divergence at the same time often marks the high point before a drop. This Activity Points To Caution The derivatives market adds another layer to the story. Trading volume in Bitcoin futures and options rose by 1.60%, taking total activity to around $100 billion. Open interest, meanwhile, slid down 1.30% to nearly $70 billion. This suggests some players are closing their bets rather than piling on new ones. In the past 24 hours, liquidations have wiped out $71 million in long positions. That kind of pain can trigger more sell\u2011offs if people rush to protect their profits. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Past Patterns Offer Mixed Lessons Looking back, Bitcoin\u2019s rebound in 2022 followed a different playbook. Back then, price hit a low near $16,000 and built strength even as RSI climbed from oversold levels. That setup led to a strong rally. Today, though, the RSI is nowhere near oversold territory. It\u2019s more of a warning flag than a green light. Captain Faibik reminds traders that past wins don\u2019t guarantee future results. Conditions now include higher interest rates and deeper institutional interest, which can change how Bitcoin reacts to the same signals. Featured image from Trade Brains, chart from TradingView"

Why XRP &#8216;Is Out Of Time&#8217; \u201cAfter months of tightening, the XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are only two paths from here: either the explosive breakout we\u2019ve been waiting for begins now, or we see one final sharp drop to support that ignites the breakout we\u2019ve all been preparing for.\u201d CasiTrades\u2019 roadmap turns on a single price: $2.25. XRP has probed that level repeatedly since the first week of June but has yet to close above it. \u201cPrice continues to struggle with the $2.25 level, a level I\u2019ve talked about continuously,\u201d she noted, arguing that every failed attempt increases the probability of a stop-hunt toward $2.01, $1.90, even $1.55. Those levels, she stressed, are \u201cmomentum zones\u2026 areas where the market grabs the liquidity it needs to build momentum for wave 3.\u201d Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move On his daily chart the Relative-Strength Index has been tracing a shallow upward channel while price has moved sideways, a structure the analyst calls a \u201cguide for the end of this squeeze.\u201d The confluence\u2014a volatility funnel on price and a steady grind higher on momentum\u2014mirrors the pattern that preceded XRP\u2019s October 2023 breakout. Beyond geometry, timing is central to CasiTrades\u2019 argument. \u201cIt\u2019s mid-week, Wednesday\u2014this is when sentiment tends to flip,\u201d she wrote, invoking a playbook familiar to short-term traders: a fake-out in the back half of the week that reverses by Friday\u2019s close, leaving late-entrants stranded. The setup, she said, is no longer purely technical. \u201cThis is not just technicals lining up, it\u2019s the whole picture aligning.

Whether the catalyst comes from a decisive hourly close above $2.25 or from a liquidity sweep into the $1.90s, the analyst\u2019s central claim is unchanged: the consolidation\u2019s lifespan has effectively expired. As she signed off, CasiTrades offered a final exhortation\u2014short, sharp, and consistent with the urgency of his chart: \u201cDo not miss what\u2019s next.\u201d Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
