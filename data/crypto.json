      "summary": "Ethereum finally pushed above the long-watched $2,800 mark, signaling renewed strength and triggering a wave of optimism across the market. However, the breakout was met with heavy volatility, as the price quickly pulled back into the previous resistance zone. Despite the rejection, ETH continues to trade near the top of its range, and analysts remain bullish on the broader altcoin outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance \u2013 Breakout Or Breakdown? With Bitcoin stabilizing near all-time highs and ETH attempting to reclaim momentum, many are calling for the start of a new altseason. Ethereum\u2019s performance is viewed as a critical signal for the broader altcoin market \u2014 and for now, the structure remains intact. Bulls are watching closely to see if ETH can bounce and retest the breakout zone with strength. Top analyst M-log1 shared a technical update, noting that ETH is currently sitting at key support levels. He emphasized the importance of a clean bounce and a breakout from the current ascending channel. While M-log1 isn\u2019t calling for a breakdown yet, he highlighted the need for caution and patience as price action unfolds. For now, Ethereum holds support, but the next move will be crucial. Ethereum Leads With Strength But Volatility Keeps Market On Edge Ethereum is currently leading the crypto market, showing relative strength as it holds above key price levels despite a backdrop of volatility and global uncertainty. Trading above $2,750, ETH has become a focal point for investors who see it as the leading indicator for a potential altcoin rally. However, recent price swings have introduced a wave of caution, as traders weigh the risk of a pullback against the promise of a breakout. Macroeconomic headwinds remain a critical factor. Global tensions, rising US Treasury yields, and uncertain trade negotiations between the US and major economies continue to drive investor sentiment. These external pressures have kept volatility high and market conviction relatively fragile, even as Ethereum maintains its structure above support. M-log1 shared a technical breakdown, noting that ETH is now sitting at a key support zone near $2,750. According to him, Ethereum \u201cneeds to bounce and break out of the current ascending channel\u201d to reignite upside momentum. If that fails, the structure may tilt bearish, with a potential revisit of the lower end of the channel. He added that while he remains optimistic, probabilities shift quickly in this environment, and the next few sessions will be critical. Still, Ethereum\u2019s relative strength amid macro noise suggests underlying confidence. If ETH can reclaim the $2,800\u2013$2,830 region and flip it into support, it could pave the way for a run toward $3,000 and set the tone for altseason. Until then, price action remains compressed, and the market watches closely as Ethereum teeters at a technical and psychological pivot point. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Ethereum Holds Key Levels As Price Tests Critical Moving Averages Ethereum is trading at $2,753 on the 3-day chart, showing strength after pushing above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,768.62. While ETH briefly reached a high of $2,785, the candle currently reflects a slight pullback from that level. This rejection is not yet a bearish signal, but it does mark the $2,770\u2013$2,785 range as a short-term resistance zone. ETH remains well-positioned technically, holding above the 50-day ($2,325), 100-day ($2,647), and 200-day ($2,768) SMAs \u2014 all critical levels that have historically guided mid- to long-term price direction. The strong rally from April lows around $1,500 to current levels has reset the trend in Ethereum\u2019s favor, but now a clean breakout above $2,800 is needed to confirm continuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level \u2013 Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Volume remains steady, with no major signs of distribution. A strong close above the 200 SMA on this 3-day candle could act as a bullish confirmation and set the stage for a push toward the $3,000 mark. On the downside, if ETH fails to hold $2,700, a retest of the $2,600\u2013$2,650 support zone is likely. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-sentiment-explodes-while-bitcoin-hyper-soars-best-presale-in-2025/",
      "summary": "There\u2019s much ado about Bitcoin these days. After notching a new all-time of $111.9K on May 22, 2025, $BTC has been trading back and forth below that mark, never falling below $100K. But usually holding sideways between $105K-$110K. But Bitcoin sentiment is beginning to build again. Will it lead to a new push for the market? If so, then the aptly-named Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale could gain the most as Bitcoin&#8217;s first Layer-2 implementing the Solana Virtual Machine. Long-Time HODLers Selling at $100K One reason for the recent selling pressure might be long-term Bitcoin hodlers finally choosing to sell. Early investors who bought Bitcoin when the price was a few thousand (Bitcoin was below $10K only a few years ago, on July 1, 2020) might be finally ready to cash out now that $BTC has gone 10x or more from their original investment. Is that a bad sign for Bitcoin investors? Not necessarily. A potential tightening of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply will likely offset the increased selling pressure. On-chain data supports that conclusion, as the amount of exchange-held Bitcoins has steadily fallen, even as Bitcoin\u2019s price rises. In fact, only weakening demand may have kept $BTC\u2019s price down so far. And that\u2019s not likely to continue forever. Bitwise CEO: \u2018No One Is Going To Sell\u2019 Once Bitcoin Breaks Through Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley thinks that tightening supply will only worsen once Bitcoin breaks through $130K-$150K. At that point, the HODLers will return, diamond hands and everything. If he\u2019s correct, then the issue of tightening supply will kick in harder than ever. And the first and perhaps only immutable law of economics \u2013 supply and demand \u2013 could supercharge Bitcoin\u2019s price. Institutional investors being more bullish than ever also helps the narrative, even as retail investors go back-and-forth with Bitcoin. Take GameStop, which recently purchased 4.7K Bitcoin and plans to offer $1.75B of convertible notes to potentially fund more purchases. A recent Santiment report shows that Bitcoin positivity is returning in the community, with positive comments outweighing the negative by more than 2-1. Growing Bitcoin hype means at least one thing: $BTC-centric presales like Bitcoin Hyper could grow big \u2013 fast. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Unlock Fast, Cheap Bitcoin Transactions with First Bitcoin Layer 2 More than a store of value; with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Bitcoin can finally be everything it was meant to be \u2013 the home of crypto payments, meme coins, dApps, and smart contracts. The technical framework for Bitcoin Hyper is straightforward; with the Bitcoin Relay Program, any $BTC deposited to a specific Bitcoin address can be minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2. That Layer 2 leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for better throughput and increased scalability, and sets $HYPER up to be one of the strongest crypto presales so far in 2025. The end result is a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) equipped Layer 2, trustless but fully synced to the Bitcoin Layer 1 blockchain. $HYPER, the native token for the Bitcoin Layer 2, provides a number of benefits for $HYPER chain users. Those benefits include: Low gas fees, paid in $HYPER Staking rewards, currently 647% APY Participation incentives Developer bounties Bitcoin Hyper\u2019s presale rocketed out of the gate, passing $1M raised in a matter of days. Token currently cost $0.01185, with $1.13M raised so far. That price could reach $0.02595 by the end of 2025 (for a 118% increase), according to our price prediction. Buy into the $HYPER, and join a community of visionaries who want to transform Bitcoin&#8217;s position in the dApp industry. Bullish Outlook Means Growing Demand for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper As $BTC supply tightens, demand will only increase. That should fuel a further increase for both $BTC and related projects, like a groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer 2. And if you consider $HYPER&#8217;s utility is all about making Bitcoin more prepared for the adoption ahead, the project&#8217;s potential in the market becomes beyond clear. Remember, always do your own research; this isn\u2019t financial advice. &#160;"

Source: BTCUSDT on Tradingview Top Bitcoin Pundit: Watch Out For This Level According to Daan Crypto, a senior crypto analyst, the Bitcoin price has weakened due to changes in the macroeconomic arena. In that sense, the analyst believes bull must hold the levels above $99,000 or they risk a bigger decline into the monthly lows sitting at around $90,000, as seen in the chart below. Some of the elements affecting the Bitcoin price on the macro side include a good Consumer Price Index (CPI) print from the US, and a \u2018good deal\u2019 between this country and Chinese representatives. These news indicate decline in inflation and potentially an end to trade war between the two giants, respectively. However, the analysis noted: At this point I&#8217;m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, that it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possible beyond). Eyes on those levels. Still quite a volatile and headline driven market currently(\u2026). So markets down on good news is always something to note. Just one day for now but good to be aware of.

      "summary": "XRP has slipped above the descending trendline that had repelled every rally since February, yet derivatives positioning suggests the apparent breakout may still end with a shake-out, according to independent market technician CasiTrades. The four-hour Binance chart shows the token gravitating around $2.32, fractionally north of the wedge\u2019s upper boundary, but only a heartbeat away from surrendering that gain if leverage forces unwind. XRP Crash Imminent? Casi frames the set-up in Elliott-wave terms, maintaining that the January\u2013June advance completed a wave (1) at roughly $2.70 and then corrected to $2.02 at the 1.236 Fibonacci extension, thereby sketching wave (2) against the wedge\u2019s base. The technician argues that the new thrust above resistance could mark the birth of wave (3), although funding dynamics cloud that bullish reading. \u201cWe\u2019re just days away from the apex of XRP\u2019s macro consolidation and price is hovering above support, while funding quietly climbs,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous combo.\u201d Eight-hour funding rates have already reached 0.01 percent. Casi insists that if they expand to 0.02 percent without a decisive price march, algorithms will hunt the liquidity pooling beneath 2.25 dollars. \u201cAs of this morning, funding rates are ticking up to 0.01 %/8h without any meaningful breakout attempt,\u201d she explained. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target \u201cIf we start to reach 0.02 % or higher with no move, it signals a high probability of a liquidity sweep to the downside.\u201d The technician warns that such a flush would drag XRP through the reclaimed breakout level and expose $2.01, $1.90 dollars and potentially $1.55. \u201cThat puts 2.01, 1.90 and even 1.55 in play if 2.25 fails,\u201d she cautioned, adding that the capitulation itself \u201cwould likely generate the exact momentum needed for a powerful wave 3 breakout.\u201d The momentum backdrop remains ambivalent. The fourteen-period RSI on the same chart hovers near 62.5 yet registers lower peaks while price edges upward, hinting at a bearish divergence that often accompanies volatility spikes. Still, the break above the black trendline cannot be ignored: if sellers fail to reclaim that line swiftly, Casi\u2019s projection of wave (3) targets $3.77 via the classic 1.618 external Fibonacci extension, with a still larger-degree objective above $4.40 dollars later this summer. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $2.50 Decision Zone As Macro Wave Structure Takes Shape Casi summarises the juncture bluntly: \u201cVolatility is nearly inevitable. Whether it&#8217;s one last dip or a significant breakout, the next move is likely to define the rest of the summer.\u201d Traders therefore face a binary path. Either rising funding catalyses a liquidity sweep toward $1.55 dollars before catapulting XRP higher, or the token consolidates above $2.25 and turns the nascent breakout into a springboard toward $2.69 dollars, the barrier near $3.04 and, eventually, the 3.77-dollar wave (3) objective. At press time, XRP traded at $2.25. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin has faced a lot of resistance above $110,000, suggesting the bears are trying to keep the digital asset from reclaiming its all-time high levels. This has been obvious with multiple rejections above $110,000 over the last few days, while the bulls have held support above $108,000. This trend plays into an analysis published by crypto analyst TehThomas, who had forecasted the rejection from $110,000. But what\u2019s more interesting is where Thomas sees the price going from here. Bitcoin Could Drop For Shallow Pullback In the analysis, Thomas explained what is happening with the Bitcoin price and why the pullback could happen. This begins with the breakout after falling toward $100,000 and then bouncing back again. The digital asset was able to quickly clear multiple fair value gaps on the 4-hour timeframes to claim its spot above $110,000. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises The crypto analyst explains that this move has triggered a shift in the sentiment toward the positive, and this has been followed by rising volumes, as well as impulsive candles. In all, this is quite bullish for the cryptocurrency. However, there is still a risk of a price decline from here. After filling multiple fair value gaps with strength, the crypto analyst believes this has set a precedent for the Bitcoin price. He expects the same pattern to play out for the cryptocurrency, which includes a rapid rise before a shallow pullback, and then a continuation from there. BTC Pullback Into $104,000 Territory The Bitcoin price recovery above $110,000 seems to have created a fair value gap below $107,000, which the crypto analyst believes will need to be filled. If this is the case, then it is possible that the price rally will not continue until this condition is fulfilled. Nevertheless, a pullback to the level would not be bearish, but rather provide a bounce-off point for the price recovery. Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash \u2013 Here Are The Targets Thomas referred to this trend as \u201ca classic breakout-fill-continue sequence\u201d, and the next thing in line is to fill the fair value gap. According to the shared chart, the crypto analyst sees the pullback taking the price back down below $105,000 and into the $104,000 territory before its next bounce. This would mean a 5% pullback, and going by the trends from this year so far, something that would be bad for altcoins. However, the conclusion remains that Bitcoin is still bullish from here. Once the fair value gap is filled, a strong push upward is expected, possibly toward new all-time highs. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a controlled retracement to fill the new 4H imbalance, after which price could continue pushing toward the major resistance area,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThe momentum is clean and structured\u2014until that changes, continuation remains the more likely path.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"
