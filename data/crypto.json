      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent pullback has sparked fresh debate over whether the rally has run its course. According to market watcher Titan of Crypto, the story isn\u2019t over yet. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Bitcoin slipped just 6% from its all\u2011time high of $112,000, but some analysts pointed to a cooling relative strength index (RSI) and warned of a top. Titan\u2019s take flips that view on its head, arguing that we\u2019re still deep in the meat of the bull cycle. Fractal Cycles Keep Running Titan pointed to a clear pattern in Bitcoin\u2019s last two cycles. Each cycle began with roughly 13 monthly bars\u2014about 396 days\u2014of steep decline. In 2014\u201315, Bitcoin fell from $1,240 to $161 over that span. Prices then rallied for 35 bars (1,065 days) to hit $19,800 in December 2017. The same 13\u2011bar slide followed by 35 bars of gains played out again after 2018, ending at $69,000 in 2021. #Bitcoin Bull Market Entering Final Phase \ud83c\udfc1 As in previous cycles: ~1 year of bear market, followed by ~3 years of expansion.$BTC looks to be in the final leg but not done yet. pic.twitter.com/MGre5ahz3P \u2014 Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) June 18, 2025 Momentum And RSI In Focus Some analysts flagged a weakening RSI as a sign that Bitcoin has peaked. That metric can\u2019t be ignored\u2014when momentum wanes, price often takes a breather. Titan\u2019s chart lays down the time\u2011based pattern, but RSI, trading volume, and on\u2011chain data give a live read on demand. Bull Run Still Has Room Based on reports, the current cycle\u2019s bullish phase kicked off in January 2023 and sits in the 29th bar this month. Bitcoin has climbed 530% since the start of that run. If history holds, we\u2019ve got at least five more monthly bars of uptrend before the rally tops out around November. Earlier studies even point to a wedge breakout that could send price to about $137,000 before any serious pullback. Big Names See Higher Peaks Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, foresees Bitcoin tearing past the $1 million mark in a fierce upswing, powered by government rollouts, sovereign bond issuances, and an urgent surge in &#8216;hyperbitcoinization&#8217; before seeing any real correction. Raoul Pal (Real Vision), the former Goldman Sachs executive, shares a familiar bullish view. He has laid out scenarios where Bitcoin hits $1 million by 2030, based on monetary stimulus and limited supply. Related Reading: Iran\u2019s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links\u2014Details Strategy&#8217;s Michael Saylor has also said Bitcoin could skyrocket to between $500,000 and $1 million before seeing any real correction. These big names in the crypto industry highlight growing institutional inflows and a looming supply squeeze after the next halving as fuel for an even higher peak. This rally isn\u2019t just a rerun of what we saw in 2017 or 2021. Bitcoin today moves with ETFs, big\u2011ticket corporate buys, and more traders watching on\u2011chain signals than ever before. Meanwhile, the latest outlook by CoinCodex sees Bitcoin climbing 5.73% to hit roughly $110,732 by July 19, 2025. Right now, technical signals point to a Neutral mood, while the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 57\u2014squarely in Greed territory. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "SUI\u2019s price chart, marked by expanding cloud zones, reflects shifting sentiment and market structure. These zones have tracked major moves from fear-based accumulation to key resistance points. With new formations developing, a potentially parabolic move could be on the horizon. Perfect Setups For SUI That Paid Off Big Cheek Analytics, in a recent X post, identified $1.57 as SUI&#8217;s fundamental price and an ideal buy zone, especially during periods of fear. Historical data show that entering at this level on August 3, 2024, could have yielded up to a 957% gain, while a similar setup on April 7, 2025, has already returned up to a 134% gain at its peak. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View Cheek Analytics also pointed to the Purple Cloud around $4 as the first significant resistance SUI needs to clear. This zone has been tested several times, with one brief breakthrough, only for the price to fall back and validate it as resistance. Cheek views this level as a key barrier: breaking above it would shift the momentum decisively and set the stage for further gains. Looking further ahead, Cheek Analytics highlighted the Orange Cloud at $9 as SUI\u2019s major resistance zone. Historically, once the purple zone is broken, price often accelerates toward this level. However, during a past attempt, growing cloud zones stalled the move, and sentiment shifted to extreme greed, triggering profit-taking. SUI later retraced by -52% and still trades -28% below its peak. To round out the roadmap, Cheek Analytics introduced the Red Cloud at $20 as the long-term target zone, a region that could come into play if the orange cloud flips to support. However, Cheek notes that on larger altcoins like SUI, the red cloud is rarely touched. This is because all cloud zones expand or contract with market movement. Higher Highs Needed: The Path To Breaking Resistance Cheek Analytics concluded that SUI shows strong long-term potential, as seen in its expanding cloud zones. However, for further upside, the price must form higher lows and higher highs; otherwise, a breakout above the purple cloud may fail and attract renewed selling pressure. Related Reading: Here\u2019s Why SUI At $3.61 Could Be the Calm Before A Parabolic Surge If the bullish structure fails to materialize, the analyst warns of a likely retracement back toward the fundamental green line at $1.57, a level described as an ideal accumulation point for long-term believers, or as they put it, \u201cbuttlievers.\u201d Currently, the sentiment indicator is already showing fear, marked by a light blue background. Should price revisit the green line, Cheek Analytics expects sentiment to shift into extreme fear, setting the stage for optimal dollar-cost averaging (DCA) conditions for committed holders aiming to ride the next major wave.

Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price\u2019s Stuck, But Not for Long? Analyst Daan Crypto shared insights regarding the current Bitcoin price action. The analyst believes that BTC has been compressing over the past weeks. In that sense, a lot of traders are expecting a spike in volatility. As seen on the image below, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a tight range form by its monthly high sitting at $110,600 and a monthly low at around $100,000. Within this range, there are two key levels to watch: the area between $109,000 and $103,000. A breakout or breakdown from this range might signal the return of volatility to the Bitcoin price action. Thus, the cryptocurrency might reclaim or return to either or the previously mentioned levels on higher timeframes. The analyst stated the following: BTC Still hanging around the $105K area which is the middle of the monthly range and right at the monthly open. Price has been compressing and it&#8217;s clear that the market is waiting for a big move to occur. The statistics still heavily favor a further displacement this week and especially this month. So keep an eye on these levels and play accordingly. Bitcoin price trading within a tight range on the 4 hour chart.

      "title": "Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bullish-wave-to-ath/",
      "summary": "Recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen Ethereum clawing back above $2,500 after a pullback that saw its price fall to a low of $2,440. This is a notable correction from Ethereum&#8217;s foray to $2,770 in the past seven-day timeframe, but according to crypto analyst KledjdiCuni, it aligns with one of the anticipated price scenarios. Now, the analyst&#8217;s outlook is of a reversal into a bullish wave. In his latest update, KlejdiCuni laid out several upside targets that traders may want to keep in focus if Ethereum confirms a breakout. Accumulation And Bullish Setup Toward $2,800 Breakout Crypto analyst KlejdiCuni, posting on the TradingView platform, believes Ethereum may now be on the verge of initiating a much larger bullish trend. According to his analysis, the $2,440 region held up as expected, confirming it as a strong accumulation zone. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Is Ready To Surge With Higher Lows Against Bitcoin, But There\u2019s A Caveat In the daily candlestick price chart he shared, KlejdiCuni illustrated what he identifies as a bullish pattern. This pattern is a formation of higher lows and relatively stable resistance near the upper boundary. This setup resembles an ascending channel structure, which suggests that buyers are gradually taking control of Ethereum&#8217;s price action. Ethereum&#8217;s rebound to $2,660 has formed a structure that could break above the current pattern, likely in the direction of $2,800. This aligns with the upper resistance boundary of the bullish pattern, and as such, it is the first immediate target to look towards for a breakout to higher price levels. Price Targets For Ethereum If Ethereum successfully breaks above the $2,800 resistance level, the bullish momentum could signal the start of the expected bullish trend, according to the analyst. In this case, the first major target in this sequence is $3,300. Ethereum&#8217;s reaction here would be one to watch, as it coincides with a resistance level in late January 2025 that eventually broke to the downside in early February 2025. If Ethereum manages to clear this zone, it would confirm a sustained buying interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke Should Ethereum maintain its upward pressure beyond $3,300, the next target is at $3,800. This level carries particular technical significance, as it coincides with an order block in early January that caused the initial rejection as it tried to push toward the $4,000 price level again. Breaking through $3,800 to the upside would be an indication that bullish sentiment has taken firm hold across higher timeframes again. Finally, if the bullish wave extends uninterrupted, the analyst projects a longer-term target of $4,500. This level is only a short distance from Ethereum\u2019s all-time high of around $4,878, and reaching it would represent a near-complete recovery from the prolonged bear market. Hitting $4,500 would also place Ethereum at new price highs for this cycle. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,521, having retraced by 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Based on reports, this move offers both retail and institutional clients a hands\u2011off way to own XRP without worrying about private wallets or unregulated platforms.

The fund plans to buy XRP from regulated sources like over\u2011the\u2011counter desks. That setup mirrors what other digital\u2011asset funds do for Bitcoin and Ether. We are excited to announce the launch of the 3iQ XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U) \u2014 one of the first ETFs in North America to provide exposure to #XRP.

The company didn\u2019t share how much it invested, but its support sends a strong message. It shows Ripple believes in XRPQ\u2019s structure and security, even after years of uncertainty about XRP in the US courts. Growth Of XRP Over A Decade Data from 2015 to now shows that XRP\u2019s price jumped to around 10,700%, climbing from $0.02 back then to $2.16 today. That surge underscores why 3iQ\u2019s CEO and President, Pascal St\u2011Jean, called this ETF \u201can easy way for Canadians and qualified investors overseas to tap into XRP\u2019s growth.\u201d He rang the TSX\u2019s closing bell to mark the launch. Purpose Joins The Fray Reports also disclose that Purpose Investments launched its own XRP ETF, XRPP, on the same day. That makes two spot XRP ETFs now available on the same exchange. Both products aim to give investors a regulated path to XRP, but only time will tell which approach wins more fans.

With XRPQ\u2019s debut, 3iQ highlights its mission of opening up digital assets in a regulated way. It\u2019s a clear sign that more traditional markets are warming up to crypto. And with Ripple\u2019s backing and a zero\u2011fee for half a year, this new ETF could draw attention from anyone who wants XRP exposure without the usual hurdles.
