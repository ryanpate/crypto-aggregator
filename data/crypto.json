      "summary": "On-chain data shows the exchanges recently received a large amount of Bitcoin inflows, but so far, the asset&#8217;s price has only been going up. Bitcoin Has Seen A Spike In Exchange Inflows Recently In a new post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Netflow for Bitcoin. The Exchange Netflow is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of the asset that&#8217;s moving into or out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchange inflows outweigh the exchange outflows. As one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the asset&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Diverge\u2014ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the holders are taking out a net number of tokens from exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow since the start of the month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has recently mostly been contained in the negative territory, but the latest value (yesterday&#8217;s) has been positive. In total, the investors have deposited a net $262.75 million of the asset to the exchange-connected wallets with this inflow spike. According to the analytics firm, this marks the first day of significant deposits since May 27th. As mentioned before, exchange inflows are something that can turn out to be bearish for the coin&#8217;s value. So far, however, the opposite has happened for Bitcoin, as its price has soared instead. This could indicate that even if there are some large holders looking to sell with these deposits, enough demand has surfaced at the same time that BTC has not only been able to ride out this wave of potential selling pressure, but actually add to its recovery. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin According to the analytics firm Glassnode, short liquidations have registered a notable uptick alongside this surge in the cryptocurrency. &#8220;Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA),&#8221; notes Glassnode. Generally, large liquidations end up providing fuel to the price move that caused them, so in this case, it&#8217;s possible the short squeeze may have provided support to the Bitcoin rally.

      "summary": "Ethereum has shown signs of regaining momentum after a recent period of decline. The asset is currently trading at approximately $2,540, reflecting a modest 1% daily increase. This upward move follows a notable dip to the $2,400 range last week, marking what appears to be a short-term rebound from recent bearish pressure. While price fluctuations continue, on-chain analysts closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s market structure through various metrics that provide historical context and potential forecasting value. Recent insights from a CryptoQuant analyst have focused on how ETH\u2019s long-term behavior aligns with certain key indicators, which may help define price floors and signal overheated market conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages \u2013 Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Assessing Ethereum Price Floors Using On-Chain Data One of CryptoQuant\u2019s analysts, writing under the name CryptoOnchain, shared a breakdown of Ethereum\u2019s potential \u201cprice floors\u201d using a composite of on-chain and market metrics. These floors represent statistical thresholds that have historically acted as support zones during market corrections. Among them is the realized price, which measures the average value at which all circulating ETH last moved on-chain. This metric is often used as a sentiment gauge to track when market participants are in profit or loss. Another benchmark, the mean_price_classic, reflects the average daily closing price of ETH since inception and serves as a cumulative market average. It is used in conjunction with the delta_price_classic, a figure derived from the difference between Ethereum\u2019s realized capitalization and its historical average cap, adjusted for supply. According to the analyst, this delta price is frequently cited in Bitcoin analytics to highlight undervalued zones, and its adaptation for Ethereum provides a comparable lens for identifying periods when the market may be at or near a floor. Tracking Market Tops and Potential Resistance Zones In a separate analysis report, CryptoOnchain highlighted tools for identifying potential market tops. The indicators outlined include the realized_price_x2 and realized_price_x3, which are calculated by multiplying Ethereum\u2019s realized price by two and three, respectively. Historically, these levels have coincided with overheated phases of the market, where prices reached temporary peaks before correcting. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 \u2013 Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Another tool, the price_top_stddev, incorporates volatility into the analysis by adding two times the historical standard deviation of ETH\u2019s closing price to the realized price. This combination serves as a marker of statistically elevated prices, often aligning with periods of heightened euphoria and speculative activity. CryptoOnchain suggests that monitoring these zones can assist traders in managing risk during extended rallies, as these resistance levels have previously preceded major cycle reversals.

      "summary": "As Bitcoin (BTC) came close to slumping below the psychologically important $100,000 mark last week, the short-term holders (STH) cohort started to show signs of weakening conviction in the leading cryptocurrency, raising fears of a deeper price correction. Bitcoin STH Fear Resurfaces According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin STH\u2019s net position has turned sharply negative over the past month. This has happened despite BTC holding above the $100,000 level. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin STH are investors who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. They are generally more reactive to price volatility and market sentiment, often selling during corrections or uncertainty. Specifically, a cumulative net position change of -833,000 BTC has been recorded among short-term holders during the ongoing pullback. By comparison, the April crash saw a net position change of around -977,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Strength As Long-Term Holder Realized Cap Surges Past $20 Billion \u2013 Details Darkfost noted that current STH behavior closely resembles the activity observed during BTC\u2019s brief drop below $80,000 in April 2025, when the digital asset bottomed out at $74,508. The analyst wrote: Since then, STH appear to have become much more sensitive to market movements, and the recent dip around the $100,000 mark was enough to trigger renewed fear among this group of investors. BTC Showing Signs of Reversal Although BTC lost momentum after reaching its latest all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, the leading cryptocurrency regained strength over the weekend &#8211; indicating a possible reversal may be underway. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift For example, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that BTC has broken through the key resistance level at $106,600. In a recent X post, Martinez predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $108,300 or even $110,000 if current momentum continues. In a separate X post, fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital shared the following Bitcoin daily chart, noting that the cryptocurrency not only broke out of its two-week downtrend &#8211; highlighted in light blue &#8211; but may now be turning that former resistance into a new support level. Meanwhile, several technical indicators also point to continued bullish momentum. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Ribbons have recently flashed a prime buying signal. Additionally, on-chain data suggests that BTC could experience a sharp upward move in the short term, potentially driven by a negative funding rate on Binance. A prolonged period of negative funding rates often sets the stage for a short squeeze. Despite the bullish outlook, some red flags remain. Recent data shows that long-term holders are gradually exiting the market, while an influx of retail investors could add volatility to the current rally. At press time, BTC trades at $107,627, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant, X, and TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/on-chain-data-flashes-bullish-is-bitcoin-ready-for-a-110k-comeback/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has resumed its upward trajectory, registering a modest 1.6% gain over the last 24 hours to trade at $107,428. The recovery comes after last week\u2019s dip toward $100,000 levels, which had been triggered by market-wide volatility and profit-taking. While BTC remains approximately 4.2% below its all-time high of $111,000 reached last month, the weekly trend still reflects a 3.3% increase, suggesting buyers are gradually regaining confidence. This market behavior is mirrored in a set of on-chain indicators recently analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages \u2013 Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Reflect Accumulation Behavior In Taha&#8217;s analysis titled \u201cOn-Chain Data Hints at Bitcoin\u2019s Next Leg Higher,\u201d Taha examined several metrics that point to a potential continuation of the rally. These include the Binance Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, UTXO age bands, and the Long-Term Holder (LTH) realized cap. All three suggest that market participants are actively accumulating and that underlying sentiment is shifting toward renewed bullishness. One of the primary indicators Taha focused on is Binance\u2019s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which has recently climbed to 1.1. This metric evaluates the volume of aggressive market buys versus market sells on the Binance exchange. A ratio above 1 typically implies that more participants are willing to pay the market price to buy than to sell, indicating stronger buyer conviction. According to Taha, such shifts historically precede continued price increases when supported by volume. Another key metric showing strength is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta over the last 90 days. This indicator tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure and is now halfway to its historical peak at 0.02. Taha explains that this suggests a market not yet overheated, with room for further accumulation. Combined with recent breakout behavior above the 1D\u20131W UTXO band, representing recently transacted coins, this hints that many new holders are currently in profit and choosing to hold rather than sell. LTH Conviction and Stablecoin Inflows Reinforce Bullish Case Taha also noted the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Cap has now surpassed $56 billion, reflecting strong hands holding a larger share of Bitcoin supply. These coins have not moved in over 155 days and are considered to represent investors with higher conviction. The increase in this metric implies that fewer coins are being sold into the market, a signal that many investors are expecting higher valuations in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leveraged Traders Are Back Betting On A Price Decline \u2014 What This Means In addition, more than $550 million in stablecoins have reportedly flowed into Binance in recent hours. Historically, such inflows to spot exchanges, as opposed to derivatives platforms, often suggest readiness to deploy capital for direct asset purchases. Notably, all of these indicators can be seen as a leading signal of potential volatility or buying pressure. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin\u2019s short-term price activity may benefit from continued accumulation and institutional positioning. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.25 zone. The price is now consolidating and might aim for an upward move above the $2.320 resistance. XRP price started a decent upward move above the $2.220 zone. The price is now trading above $2.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.320 resistance zone. XRP Price Aims Fresh Increase XRP price formed a base and started a fresh increase from the $2.050 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $2.120 and $2.20 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $2.25 level. Finally, the price tested the $2.320 resistance. A high was formed at $2.3294 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high. The price is now trading above $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.320 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.350 level. The next resistance is $2.40. A clear move above the $2.40 resistance might send the price toward the $2.420 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.480 resistance or even $2.50 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.550. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $2.320 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.2750 level. The next major support is near the $2.250 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.220 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels \u2013 $2.2750 and $2.250. Major Resistance Levels \u2013 $2.320 and $2.350."
