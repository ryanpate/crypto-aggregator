      "summary": "A fund based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced a significant investment of $100 million in the Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial, and its native token WLFI. The investment was confirmed in a joint statement by Aqua 1 and World Liberty Financial, highlighting the collaboration as a step towards developing a blockchain financial ecosystem and integrating stablecoins. World Liberty Financial Partners With Aqua 1 Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, &#8220;We\u2019re excited to work hand-in-hand with the team at Aqua 1.\u201d This investment positions Aqua 1 among the largest stakeholders in the Trump family&#8217;s cryptocurrency project. It is further strengthened by the backing of crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is the top investor in the company with a substantial $75 million stake. Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move \u2014 Chart Signals Are Clear This marks the second investment from a UAE-based firm in World Liberty Financial within a short span; earlier this year, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s MGX used World Liberty Financial&#8217;s USD1 stablecoin to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance. David Lee, a founding partner at Aqua 1, stated that Aqua 1 and the decentralized platform will collaborate to \u201cidentify and nurture promising blockchain projects.\u201d World Liberty Financial also plans to support the Aqua Fund, an investment vehicle focused on enhancing the digital economy in the Middle East. In addition, Aqua 1 will aid World Liberty Financial in expanding its reach into South America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. Both companies are also set to develop &#8220;BlockRock,&#8221; a platform aimed at tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) to bridge traditional investments like real estate with the Web3 ecosystem. New App Launch Planned In tandem with these initiatives, World Liberty Financial is preparing to release an audit report of its stablecoin, USD1, within days. Folkman, speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, New York, also mentioned that the platform&#8217;s WLFI token may soon become tradable. Launched two months prior to the US presidential election, WLFI has already generated substantial revenue for Trump\u2019s family business through the sale of governance tokens. These tokens grant holders the ability to vote on project changes and influence its strategic direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In?

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-binance-open-interest-warning-btc/",
      "summary": "Data shows the Bitcoin Open Interest on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance has recently shot up. What could this mean for the asset&#8217;s price? Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Has Seen A Sharp Increase As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Open Interest on Binance has spiked. The &#8220;Open Interest&#8221; refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC positions that are currently open on a given derivatives platform. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. As the total amount of leverage present in the sector rises when new positions appear, this kind of trend can lead to the asset&#8217;s price becoming more volatile. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Since leverage goes down with such a trend, the cryptocurrency can become more stable following it. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-hour percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest for the Binance exchange over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the 24-hour change in the Binance Bitcoin Open Interest recently shot up to a notably positive value, implying the number of positions on the platform saw a significant jump. At the peak of this spike, the indicator hit a value of more than 6%. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that there have been a couple of other occasions that the metric has breached this mark during the past month. Interestingly, each of these spikes coincided with points that preceded a period of consolidation/decline for Bitcoin. As the quant notes, This recurring pattern suggests that large inflows into leveraged positions often precede periods where short-term gains are realized, leading to potential price pullbacks or sideways movement as market participants de-risk. The analyst has also shared another chart, this one tracking the 7-day change in the Realized Cap of the short-term holders and long-term holders. The &#8220;Realized Cap&#8221; refers to an indicator that keeps track of the capital that the holders have invested into Bitcoin. Below is a chart that shows the change in this metric for two investor cohorts, short-term holders (holding time of 155 days or lesser) and long-term holders (holding time greater than 155 days). As is apparent from the graph, the 7-day change in the Realized Cap has recently been positive for long-term holders, which suggests capital has been maturing from the short-term holders into this cohort. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals \u2018Opportunity\u2019 That said, earlier in the month, the indicator hit a peak of $57 billion, but today it has come down to just $3.5 billion. So, while capital is still aging into long-term holders, it&#8217;s now happening at a much slower rate. BTC Price Bitcoin has been attempting to break past the $108,000 mark, but so far, it hasn&#8217;t found success as its price is still trading around $107,200.

ADA price started a fresh decline below $0.580 and $0.5750. The price is trading below $0.570 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.570 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it dips below the $0.550 support zone. Cardano Price Dips Again In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline below the $0.580, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA even declined below the $0.5750 level to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5102 swing low to the $0.5938 high. The price even spiked below the $0.5520 support. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.570 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading below $0.570 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.570 zone. The first resistance is near $0.5850. The next key resistance might be $0.5920. If there is a close above the $0.5920 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.620 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.6350 in the near term. Another Drop In ADA? If Cardano\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.5850 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.5520 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5102 swing low to the $0.5938 high. The next major support is near the $0.530 level. A downside break below the $0.530 level could open the doors for a test of $0.5120. The next major support is near the $0.50 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels \u2013 $0.5520 and $0.5300. Major Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.5850 and $0.6000."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-net-taker-volume-spikes-as-billions-exit-derivatives/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has regained some upward momentum, with its market price currently hovering around $107,155 at the time of writing. This marks a 0.4% decrease in the past 24 hours, and a 4.3% drop below its all-time high of $111,000, set in May. Despite the rebound, analysts are closely watching for potential shifts in momentum as a number of market indicators and macroeconomic signals suggest a more cautious short-term outlook. Among the recent developments drawing attention is a sharp rise in Net Taker Volume on Binance, along with significant stablecoin outflows from derivative platforms. CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha noted in a recent market commentary that these changes could indicate increased speculative activity. While some traders interpret such surges as bullish signals, they often occur due to short liquidations or sudden retail buying rather than consistent organic demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment Derivatives Activity and Fed Commentary Fuel Market Caution On June 24, Binance\u2019s Net Taker Volume crossed $100 million for the first time since early June. This level of activity, according to Taha, can sometimes signal buying momentum but may also point to forced closures of short positions, especially in high-leverage environments. Taha emphasized that without strong capital inflows to back the movement, these bursts tend to be short-lived. Simultaneously, more than $1.25 billion in stablecoin liquidity has exited derivative exchanges, marking the largest capital outflow from these platforms since May. These outflows reduce the base for opening new leveraged positions, potentially dampening future market momentum. Taha also pointed to external economic cues, particularly a recent statement by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. During his testimony before Congress, Powell signaled that rate cuts may be on the table depending on upcoming economic conditions. While looser monetary policy is often viewed as favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin, the shift also reflects underlying uncertainty. The analyst also mentioned that the Swiss Franc, traditionally seen as a safe-haven currency, has also surged against the US dollar, suggesting that some investors are leaning risk-off amid broader macroeconomic developments. Market Structure Remains Firm, But Momentum Is Slowing Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Dan offered a different perspective using a bubble chart model that visualizes trading volume trends across exchanges. According to Dan, Bitcoin is currently experiencing a \u201ccooling\u201d phase. This implies reduced trading activity without dramatic spikes in volume, often seen as a sign that the market is consolidating rather than overheating.
