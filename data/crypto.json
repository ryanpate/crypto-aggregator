      "summary": "Bitcoin remains within a relatively tight range, struggling to gain sufficient momentum to break the $110,000 mark. At the time of writing, the leading crypto by market cap trades at $106,437, down 1.1% over the past 24 hours and nearly 4.8% below its May all-time high. The current consolidation range between $105,000 and $107,000 has prompted close monitoring of market behavior, especially from whales and long-term holders (LTHs), as the market attempts to find its next direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near Bitcoin Whales Lead Market Activity as Profit Realization Surges Recent data from CryptoQuant suggests that a significant shift in realized profits on Binance may be influencing short-term price trends. CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk highlighted a major event on June 16, when over $2.6 billion in profits were realized on Binance alone, the second-largest spike of its kind on the platform. This activity was followed by immediate selling pressure and market reaction, suggesting that profit-taking from large investors remains a core factor in the current price movement. According to Crazzyblockk, the June 16 event saw a total of $4.5 billion in realized profits across centralized exchanges, with Binance accounting for nearly 58% of that volume. \u201cThis milestone is more than just a data point \u2014 it\u2019s a reminder of Binance&#8217;s unmatched influence on global crypto markets,\u201d the analyst wrote. He emphasized Binance\u2019s role in price discovery and how whale behavior on the platform often serves as a proxy for broader market sentiment. As institutional participants and high-net-worth investors execute large moves on Binance, their actions can foreshadow phases of trend reversals or sustained accumulation. The data also shows the importance of tracking realized profit and loss (PnL) metrics, especially on high-volume exchanges. The event reflects what Crazzyblockk described as \u201cstrategic profit-taking by sophisticated participants,\u201d many of whom rely on Binance&#8217;s infrastructure for executing high-liquidity trades. Long-Term Holder Selling Seen as Constructive Rotation In a separate QuickTake post, CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei Dent offered a different perspective by analyzing long-term holder activity. Dent observed that although Bitcoin has been trading sideways between $100,000 and $110,000 since May, on-chain indicators such as Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) and Binary CDD show persistent selling from long-term holders. These are entities that have held their coins for more than six months, indicating a redistribution of supply. However, Dent argues that this selling may not imply weakness. \u201cDespite this steady LTH selling, the price hasn&#8217;t broken down. This means the market is absorbing the sell pressure\u2014implying new demand is coming in,\u201d he explained. According to Dent, this dynamic, a rotation from older holders to new buyers, is common during mid-to-late stages of a bull market. Related Reading: Warning Signs? Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Take Profits as Leverage Spikes He also noted increased activity from coins held for one to three years, possibly reflecting profit-taking from previous cycle participants. Ultimately, Dent suggested the market may be undergoing a quiet redistribution, a phase that could lay the groundwork for future upside if buy-side demand remains strong.

      "title": "XRP Roadmap To $8.5: Why The Next Impulse Could Start Soon",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-roadmap-to-8-5/",
      "summary": "XRP is starting to draw attention again as signs of a potential breakout begin to take shape. With market sentiment gradually shifting and XRP holding key support levels, analysts suggest that the stage may be set for the next impulse wave. If momentum continues to build and critical resistances are cleared, XRP could be on the verge of an explosive price rally to $8.5. Elliott Wave Points To Major XRP Price Breakout Paul Webborn, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has released a new XRP forecast update, reinforcing his bullish stance on the third-largest cryptocurrency. In his analysis, the market expert reveals that XRP may be entering a powerful impulse phase, with projected targets potentially reaching or even surpassing $8 in the current cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Is Moving According To Plan, Here\u2019s Why $1.90 Is Important Webborn\u2019s analysis applies Elliott Wave Theory to track XRP\u2019s price movements from its June 2022 low, identifying that point as the start of a new bullish cycle. The chart provides a visual roadmap of XRP\u2019s next moves based on the impulse wave structure. The cryptocurrency is expected to experience a short-term rise to initial targets below $8, followed by a brief pullback before a final rally that could push XRP to new all-time highs. Notably, the chart shows that primary Waves A and B have already played out, and XRP is now progressing through Wave C, which is unfolding in five intermediate waves. Intermediate waves 1 through 4 appear complete, with Wave 5 still forming. Webborn notes that this final fifth wave is expected to break down into five smaller minor waves. Minor wave 3 is projected to push XRP toward the $5 and $6 range, while the full extension of Wave C could carry it to between $8 and $10. The analyst has set an invalidation level at $1.90, meaning any move below that would break the current bullish structure and possibly lead to further downward pressure on the XRP price. Webborn predicts that if the $1.90 level is broken, XRP could potentially experience a crash toward new lows around $0.287, marking more than an 87% decline from its present market price. However, the chart suggests that this low has already been reached, further reinforcing the bullish narrative that the altcoin may be on the verge of a major upward breakout. While Webborn has provided no specific timeline for his optimistic forecast, the analyst believes that the coming few months could be explosive as the market enters the next phase of the impulse. Update On Price Action Lately, the XRP price has maintained strong support above $2, showing strength despite an extended consolidation period. CoinMarketCap data shows that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $2.22, reflecting a modest 1.35% rise over the past day.

As the network continues to mature, the rise in small holders also signals expanding grassroots adoption\u2014an encouraging sign during a period of market uncertainty. While short-term price action may still be driven by broader macro trends, sentiment around Solana is clearly improving. If ETF approval becomes a reality, the combination of increased accessibility and rising on-chain adoption could significantly boost Solana\u2019s market position in the coming months. Solana Growing On-Chain Adoption Solana is currently trading below the $150 mark after experiencing a sharp retracement from its May high. The asset has lost more than 20% in value since peaking earlier this cycle, driven largely by broader market consolidation and declining risk appetite across altcoins. Despite the recent pullback, SOL continues to hold a strong support zone near the $135\u2013$140 range, which has proven resilient during previous sell-offs. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, noting that a sustained push above key supply zones\u2014particularly the $155\u2013$165 range\u2014could reignite bullish momentum. However, the market remains in a phase of indecision. Price action across major assets, including Solana, reflects uncertainty as traders wait for a clear breakout or breakdown to confirm the next move. Without a strong catalyst, SOL may continue to consolidate alongside the broader altcoin market. Amid the sideways price action, one encouraging signal is the growing on-chain adoption. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Glassnode showing that the number of wallets holding over 0.1 SOL has reached a new all-time high, now exceeding 11.44 million. This steady rise in non-zero wallets points to expanding retail participation and long-term holder confidence, even as short-term volatility persists. The divergence between price action and user adoption suggests that Solana\u2019s fundamental growth remains intact. If momentum returns and macro conditions improve, Solana may be well-positioned for a breakout, especially with ETF rumors fueling speculative interest. For now, the $150 level remains a psychological pivot as the market watches for signs of direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near SOL Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $149.30, just below the key resistance confluence of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all clustered between $150 and $151. This area has acted as a strong technical barrier, and SOL&#8217;s repeated failure to reclaim it reflects the market&#8217;s hesitancy amid broader uncertainty. After rallying to $159.99 earlier in the session, bears stepped in and pushed the price back down, closing the candle with a bearish wick, signaling ongoing selling pressure. The chart reveals a prolonged consolidation pattern that has developed since the mid-May rejection near $180. Despite several bounce attempts, SOL has not been able to regain bullish momentum. The volume profile also suggests fading interest during upswings, a common trait during accumulation or exhaustion phases. Notably, price remains above the March low, preserving a key higher low structure, which is crucial for the broader bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles Below ATH After Weeks Of Failed Attempts \u2013 $109K Level In Focus If SOL breaks above the $151\u2013$155 range with sustained volume, it could trigger a move toward $180. However, failure to clear this resistance might lead to another test of support around $135. Traders should watch for a decisive close above the moving average cluster to confirm trend continuation, especially with ETF speculation fueling long-term optimism.
