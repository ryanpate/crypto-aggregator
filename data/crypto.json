      "summary": "With the Bitcoin price rising to new all-time highs every other day, more crypto analysts have come forth with their predictions for where the pioneer cryptocurrency could be headed next. One analyst in particular points out an incredibly bullish development on the Bitcoin price chart that suggests that the rally is far from over. As the trend continues to play out, it is possible that the rise above $118,000 is only the start of the uptrend. Bitcoin Enters Full Price Discovery After clearing the resistance at $117,000, the Bitcoin price has now entered what crypto analysts are referring to as price discovery. This term refers to buyers and sellers determining the price of Bitcoin, and there seems to be a consensus that the digital asset is worth more, and this could trigger the next uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Break Above $118,000 Just The Start, Analyst Unveils \u2018Golden Number\u2019 An analysis from crypto analyst AltcoinGordon focuses on a particular resistance line that has persisted for the Bitcoin price for the last eight years. This resistance line went through the highs from both March and November 2021, and was not broken. Then again, through the nights in May 2025, and remained unbroken. However, the resistance line has finally succumbed to pressure from the bulls and has been broken through after Bitcoin made it through $117,000. This simply means that there is nothing now holding back the digital asset, allowing it to climb freely from here. Due to this, the analyst believes that this breakout is no ordinary breakout, but rather one that triggers the start of parabolas. In this case, a parabolic rally would lead the Bitcoin price above the $130,000 level if the momentum is maintained. BTC Price Discovery Is Good For Altcoins Altcoin Gordon points out that the Bitcoin price discovery is particularly good for altcoins, as they will rally harder. \u201cPrice discovery is in full effect now.

      "summary": "Stellar (XLM) has seen a sudden burst of activity this week. According to recent data, XLM jumped 12% in the last 24 hours to trade around $0.48. Its seven\u2011day return is even more eye\u2011catching, with a gain of 92%. Trading volume on spot markets climbed to $14 billion, a 17% rise, showing that investors are piling in. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Awaits The Next Bitcoin Sale: \u2018My Fellow Pigs And I Are Feasting\u2019 Support Turns Into Base Based on reports, the old resistance zone at $0.31 up to $0.37 has flipped into a solid support area. That shift gives buyers a clear line in the sand. Wave 3 in the Elliott count seems to be stretching higher, suggesting there\u2019s room for more upside if momentum holds. Derivatives Activity Paints A Mixed Picture Spot volume is surging. But derivatives tell a slightly different story. CoinGlass figures show that derivatives trading volume slipped 2.25% to $3.80 billion even as Open Interest jumped 29% to $496 million. The rise in Open Interest means more new positions are on the table. Yet funding rates indicate traders aren\u2019t over\u2011leveraging just to chase quick gains. Source: Coinglass The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting near 89, well above the usual overbought threshold of 70. That level often triggers short\u2011term pullbacks. Still, in a strong uptrend, RSI can hug lofty readings for longer than many expect. The MACD line at 0.02 lies comfortably above its signal line at 0.01, and the growing histogram bars hint that bullish momentum is not fading anytime soon. Nine-Year Trend Shows Strength Analysts point out that Stellar has logged nine straight years of higher lows. That pattern has held through bear markets and bull runs alike. If that trend stays intact, it could pave the way for a fifth wave\u2014or a Wave C\u2014move similar to past rallies in major altcoins. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Market Activity Signals Caution Traders are keeping a close eye on volume and on\u2011chain signals. Sharp inflections in RSI or a sudden shift in funding rates could spark profit\u2011taking. A pullback toward the $0.35\u2013$0.38 zone would still leave XLM in a bullish setup, and it might give fresh buyers a better entry point. Based on the mix of strong on\u2011chain support, robust momentum indicators, and a long\u2011term uptrend, Stellar looks set for more gains. But with 92% surge in a week, a pause or small correction wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Traders and investors will be watching closely as sessions unfold to see if XLM can push past $0.50 or if it takes that breather first. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-liquidity-supercycle-just-begun-hedge-fund-ceo/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin punched through a fresh record above $122,000 on the morning of 14 July, extending its month-long rally to more than 16 percent. Against that backdrop, Charles Edwards\u2014the founder and chief executive of digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments\u2014argues that the market is only \u201cin the early stages\u201d of a much broader liquidity-driven boom that could dominate the rest of 2025 and beyond. The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle In the latest Capriole newsletter, Edwards contends that \u201cmoney and liquidity provided the backdrop for capital flows, and Bitcoin Treasury Companies are the funnel.\u201d He dismisses the idea that the past fortnight\u2019s $20,000 advance was a technical accident, pointing instead to deep macro currents that have been building for months. \u201cThe biggest Bitcoin rallies occur when the market is net short the USD,\u201d he writes, pointing to Capriole\u2019s proprietary \u201cUSD Positioning\u201d gauge, which aggregates futures data across major currencies. The metric has been \u201cdeeply negative\u201d since early summer, signalling that global investors are decisively betting against the dollar and in favour of hard assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Soar To $146K In The Next Leg Up \u2014 Analyst Explains How Another pillar is credit. BBB-rated corporate-bond spreads have been grinding tighter since the spring, a classic risk-on signal in traditional markets that, since 2020, has mapped almost tick-for-tick onto major Bitcoin up-moves. \u201cMore evidence,\u201d Edwards notes, \u201cthat Bitcoin is a tradfi asset.\u201d Perhaps the strongest tail-wind, however, is raw money growth. Global M3 has been expanding at an annualised nine percent clip\u2014an historically extreme rate that Capriole says last coincided with average 12-month Bitcoin returns of roughly 460 percent. Edwards cautions that, as a multi-trillion-dollar asset today, Bitcoin is unlikely to repeat that magnitude, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see something very substantial from here.\u201d Capriole\u2019s framework also draws on an historical lead-lag relationship between gold and Bitcoin. When bullion enters a meaningful breakout, Bitcoin has tended to follow three to four months later. Gold\u2019s early-2025 surge\u2014and its outperformance versus global equities\u2014therefore offered \u201cstrong support for the current market\u2019s diminishing demand for fiat money and favour of hard money,\u201d Edwards argues. Since Capriole flagged gold\u2019s move in April, Bitcoin has risen 28 percent. Equities, too, are offering green lights. The New York Stock Exchange advance\u2013decline line broke to new highs last week, while Capriole\u2019s \u201cEquity Premium\u201d indicator reset to zero in late May\u2014both historically consistent with multi-month stretches of expanding risk appetite. All of those data points feed into the firm\u2019s flagship Bitcoin Macro Index, a composite of dozens of public and proprietary variables that Capriole uses to shape trading exposures in its fund. The index \u201cis still in strong positive growth territory,\u201d Edwards reports, even after the coin\u2019s latest vertical move. That suggests the underlying drivers\u2014liquidity, risk sentiment and on-chain activity\u2014\u201cremain intact.\u201d The Bitcoin Treasury-Company Flywheel Yet perhaps the most striking piece of the puzzle lies outside pure macro. Edwards highlights the emergence of Bitcoin Treasury Companies (TCs)\u2014corporate vehicles that raise fiat capital in equity or debt markets and then deploy it into spot BTC\u2014as the new \u201cprimary bubble dynamic of this cycle.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800\u2014Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? Quarterly inflows into TCs reached $15 billion in Q2, and Capriole counts at least 145 such firms now pursuing the strategy. With their market capitalisations inflated by paper gains on balance-sheet coins, they can tap ever-larger funding rounds\u2014a reflexive loop that Edwards believes \u201cwill likely help add over $1 trillion to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap over the next year.\u201d He rejects the notion that this amounts to unhealthy centralisation: \u201cIf Bitcoin is to one day become base money, it needs to scale to tens of trillions to flatten volatility. The only way that happens is mass acquisition like we are seeing today.\u201d Edwards stresses that his analysis sits on a months-long horizon. \u201cWhen Bitcoin sees huge rallies there are always strong pullbacks and local overheating,\u201d he concedes, adding that the newsletter deliberately sidelines short-term on-chain froth to focus on the \u201cbigger picture and driving factors for the next six months.\u201d Still, with central-bank liquidity abundant, the dollar crowded short, credit stress muted and a structurally new pool of corporate buyers stepping in, Capriole\u2019s conclusion is unambiguous: the liquidity tap is wide open, and the Bitcoin supercycle it feeds has only just begun. \u201cWhile today\u2019s early adopters may be seen as speculators, it will be very obvious in hindsight. After the Treasury company wave is the Government treasury wave (next cycle). We are simply riding the adoption curve which requires trillions of dollars to flow in to Bitcoin from the entities that have it in order to achieve scale,\u201d Edwards concludes.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-possible/",
      "summary": "After hitting a new all-time high of $121,400, the Bitcoin price has started consolidating once again, although the support continues to hold. This is not out of the ordinary, as pullbacks after a major rally are quite common and could be the cool-off needed the uptrend to continue. However, while the $117,000 support has held nicely, it is possible that a deeper correction could be in the cards for the cryptocurrency before the price takes off again. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Could Begin With the hit to new all-time highs, the weekend brought a slowdown, and this could drive the next wave of correction. Crypto analyst TehThomas explains this in a TradingView post that suggests that there is still the possibility of a short-term correction for the Bitcoin price. However, it could go deeper than expected as the price moves to retest newly formed support at $109,000 and $110,000. Related Reading: Ripple\u2019s $21 Trillion Dream: What Capturing 20% Of SWIFT Volume Means For XRP According to the analyst, the new peaks have plunged the Bitcoin price into uncharted territory, and there would be a new wave of sells from here. Given this, the analyst advices caution as investors engage with the market and the possibility of a deeper correction arises. Furthermore, there is the formation of an ascending trendline that formed with the horizontal support. Since the trendline moves through the $111,000-$113,000 area, it suggests that the price could fall back downward to retest this level. In the case of a deeper correction, then the analyst sees a price sweep into the $110,000 levels to take out liquidity. However, this sweep would be inherently bullish since the retest would provide a bounce-off point that could lead to a \u201cmore sustainable\u201d breakout toward all-time highs. Bullish Prospects Still At Large For BTC While the possibility of a sweep down to former peak levels remains high, it is also possible that the price does not break down and instead continues its upward trajectory. Looking back at the ascending trendline, the analyst points out that it is possible that the price does hold the trendline, reducing the impact of the correction. Such a shallow correction would indicate a continuation without a deeper correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stalls After Rally: Will It Blast Through $125,000 Or Slip Back To $110K? In this case, the Bitcoin price could resume the uptrend with the $120,000-$125,000 targets in mind. Thus, any deep correction would be expected to begin at much higher price levels. &#8220;Bitcoin is currently in price discovery, which means the structure must guide our expectations. A retest of either the trendline or former resistance could provide the next best entry,\u201d TehThomas explained. Regardless of what the case may be, the analyst believes that as long as the price remains above the $110,000 support, then it is inherently bullish.
