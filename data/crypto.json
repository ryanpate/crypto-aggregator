      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/itcoin-breakdown-if-this-continues-it-snaps/",
      "summary": "Bearish sentiment on X continues to grow, fueling a rising number of crash forecasts. Among them is Dom (@traderview2), a widely followed crypto market analyst, who issued a stark warning on Wednesday: Bitcoin is approaching a structural tipping point that could trigger a severe breakdown if bulls fail to act swiftly. \u201cIf this continues, it snaps,\u201d Dom cautioned, referring to a wave of relentless selling pressure and thinning liquidity across major exchanges. Time Is Ticking For Bitcoin In a detailed post, Dom described current market conditions as \u201cvital,\u201d noting that Bitcoin and the broader crypto space are at a moment where \u201cit needs to save itself or we&#8217;re going south.\u201d The recent weekly chart, he said, reflects a bearish \u201cliquidity grab\u201d\u2014a move where BTC pushed above the previous weekly high only to sharply reverse, a pattern often marking local tops. That reversal has been accompanied by a three-touch declining strength formation, signaling fading bullish momentum. \u201cI think time is ticking for bulls to save this chart, as it needs to happen soon IMO,\u201d Dom added, underscoring the urgency of a bullish reclaim to invalidate the setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is The Purest AI Trade, Says Wall Street Veteran Beneath price action, the structural foundation appears increasingly fragile. Dom pointed to alarmingly thin order books across key spot markets\u2014Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken. Over the past three weeks, roughly 38,000 BTC has been sold into the market, absorbed by passive bids. While buyers have held so far, the analyst warned that visible liquidity beneath current price levels is virtually nonexistent. \u201cThere is virtually no support down to 80ks (at least as of now), not even advertisement of support,\u201d he said. The same bearish pattern is playing out in perpetual futures markets. Platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Hyperliquid have seen consistent taker-side selling, forming what Dom described as a \u201crelentless downtrend of market selling.\u201d With perp books also thin, the pressure may be unsustainable unless conditions change quickly. Drawing a parallel to Bitcoin\u2019s February breakdown from the 90k level, Dom noted, \u201cWe saw the same dynamic pre-90k breakdown.\u201d The implication is clear: without a shift in market behavior, BTC may be headed toward a similar fate. Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin Now? Not Yet\u2014Analyst Says Time Holds The Key Seasonal trends are adding weight to the bearish outlook. Dom highlighted that summer months historically bring weaker market participation and lower liquidity\u2014an environment that exacerbates downside moves and limits the impact of bullish efforts to regain control. Despite the grim analysis, Dom remains clear on what would invalidate his bearish stance: a recovery of the 108.5k level. \u201cIf that level regains, great. I think we can void these signals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for now, bearish outlook for me is the better R/R on a risk-first basis.\u201d In a separate reply, Dom acknowledged that a dip to the $96,000\u2013$98,000 region, even with a wick into the $80,000\u2019s, would not necessarily break structure. \u201cIt surely would not be abnormal and I think structure would still be ok,\u201d he wrote, adding that he would reassess the setup if such a move occurs. With order books thinning, taker flow intensifying, and no solid support beneath, Dom\u2019s message is blunt: time is running out. At press time, BTC traded at $104,694.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-crash-2000/",
      "summary": "While the Bitcoin price stays close to its all-time highs, the Ethereum price has done pretty much the opposite. This failure to perform has put intense bearish pressure on the altcoin market as a whole, and the resulting price action has triggered what is seemingly a bear market for altcoins. Even now, the Ethereum price has not shown any signs of a bullish recovery, with expectations remaining bleak at this level, and analysts predicting further crashes. Why The Ethereum Price Is Headed Below $2,000 Crypto analyst Maddox Metrics has given the short and long-term outlook for the Ethereum price, and it seems the current market decline is nowhere near its end. In the short term, Maddox expects the Ethereum price to continue to decline and, in fact, fall below some major support levels. Related Reading: XRP Addresses Holding 1M Coins Reach 12-Year High As Experts Predict Move Above $4 As the crypto analyst explains, investors are already expecting the ETH price to actually fall lower toward the $1,900 target. And as shown in the analyst\u2019s chart, this would actually be the second wave of the 5-wave count as Ethereum moves into its long-term potential. While there has been a lot of buying, especially among institutional investors and ETF issuers, the Ethereum price continues to trend low. The analyst attributes this to the rising war tensions in the Middle East, as fears of World War 3 grow more intense. At this level, the analyst cautions investors to look toward a more patient strategy, saying that \u201cMoney is made in the sitting, weathering volatility, not flipping in and out of trades on every bit of news and price movement.\u201d Thus, it is better to hold positions until the market finds its stable point. ETH Still Bullish In The Long-Term Despite the wave pattern pointing to a crash below $2,000 in the short term, the analyst says the long-term outlook for the Ethereum price remains bullish. The current decline, which is a Wave 2 retracement, the analyst explains, marked the end of a motif wave at the $2,700 resistance. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Price Set To Repeat History As 2017 Playbook Returns? Why This Time Could Be Bigger This suggests that once the current wave ends, there is the next wave, which is the bullish Wave 3. Once this is underway, the analyst\u2019s chart shows a possibility of this wave carrying through to a new all-time high just under $5,000. The 4th wave is naturally bearish and will trigger a crash, while the 5th and final wave will send the Ethereum price to $7,000. The timeline for this to happen, as shown in the chart, will be through the year 2025 and into the early months of 2026. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Amid the geopolitical turmoil, Solana (SOL) has retraced 10% in the past week. Some analysts believe that the altcoin\u2019s correction is about to end, but warned that a dip below a key support level might come first. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For New Highs As Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $5 Solana Eyes Key Retest Before Breakout After retesting the $168 resistance last Wednesday, Solana has fallen back to a key level fueled by the recent market pullback. The cryptocurrency has seen a 15% retracement from its monthly highs, trading around the $140 zone for the past three days. SOL has been hovering between the $145-$180 price range since its May breakout, falling to the range lows during the June market shakeouts. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to reclaim the $160-$170 mid-zone. Nonetheless, market watcher Lluciano considers that Solana \u201cmay dip a bit more, but the ultimate target is seriously huge.\u201d The analyst highlighted SOL\u2019s performance since April, noting that it ended its multi-month downtrend after breaking above its descending resistance at the end of March. After this price action, SOL retested the $100-$120 demand zone before breaking out to its current range in the following weeks. Now, the altcoin\u2019s chart displays a one-month falling wedge pattern, with the upper boundary sitting around the $155-$160 area. To the analyst, a breakout from this pattern could send the cryptocurrency toward May\u2019s $187 high resistance before propelling the price to retest the $240 mark. Similarly, trader Rose noted that SOL has been consolidating above the key $145 resistance and 50-day Moving Average (MA), signaling a potential breakout. \u201cIf confirmed, the price could rise toward targets at $165, $183, and $220,\u201d they suggested. SOL To Underperform In Coming Months? Market watcher Crypto Bullet suggested that Solana\u2019s correction is coming to an end. The analyst forecasted that SOL could soon lose its current range and retest the April consolidation range, around the $125-$135 area, to complete the correction. This would be followed by a bounce back into the current range before surging past the $200 barrier toward the $220-$250 targets, for \u201cone more wave up\u201d this cycle. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa affirmed Solana won\u2019t outperform like it did during the first half of the cycle. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency won\u2019t outperform Bitcoin (BTC) on any long-term timeframe \u201cother than a few blips here and there.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Setting Up For \u2018Large Move\u2019 Amid $103,000 Retest \u2013 Key Levels To Watch He explained that the cycle\u2019s leading altcoin isn\u2019t \u201cdead,\u201d but that he doesn\u2019t \u201csee it having a run like it did in 2021/2024.\u201d Notably, SOL is currently retesting its late November 2023 support levels against BTC, which previously sent it to yearly lows after failing to hold them. Altcoin Sherpa concluded that Solana will likely continue to climb against its USDT pair but continue to bleed in its SOL/BTC chart. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $145, a 12.1% decline in the monthly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

Bitcoin cash price started a fresh increase above the $480 level. The price is trading above $480 and the 100-hour simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $472 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Cash Price Starts Fresh Surge After forming a base above the $440 level, Bitcoin Cash price started a fresh increase. BCH outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum to gain over 8%. There was a clear move above the $470 resistance zone. The price even surpassed $480 and tested the $495 resistance zone. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $472 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. A high was formed near $505 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $455 swing low to the $502 high. Bitcoin cash price is now trading above $485 and the 100-hour simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside sits near the $500 level. A clear move above the $500 resistance might start a decent increase. The next major resistance is $505, above which the price might accelerate higher toward the $520 level. Any further gains could lead the price toward the $535 resistance zone. Are Dips Supported In BCH? If Bitcoin Cash price fails to clear the $500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $490 level. The next major support is near the $480 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $455 swing low to the $502 high.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-forming-inverse-head-and-shoulders-pattern-is-150000-the-next-target/",
      "summary": "Although Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) momentum has stalled over the past week due to escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the flagship cryptocurrency appears to be forming a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern on the three-day chart &#8211; significantly increasing the likelihood of a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Bitcoin Eyeing New ATH Soon? In an X post published today, crypto analyst Mister Crypto highlighted that BTC is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the three-day chart. The analyst shared the following chart, noting that a successful breakout could propel Bitcoin\u2019s price as high as $150,000. For the uninitiated, the inverse head &#38; shoulders is a bullish chart pattern that signals a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It consists of three troughs, a lower low &#8211; called the &#8220;head&#8221; &#8211; between two higher lows &#8211; called the &#8220;shoulders.&#8221; This is followed by a breakout above the &#8220;neckline&#8221; resistance, indicating rising buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Despite ongoing uncertainty in the market, analysts remain largely optimistic. For example, noted analyst Jelle pointed out that BTC has formed a major bullish pennant above previous highs &#8211; another positive technical signal. BTC is also poised to benefit from shrinking supply on trading platforms. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto commentator Master of Crypto noted that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are about to fall below two million &#8211; the lowest level since 2017. Depleting BTC balances on exchanges suggest that investors are moving their Bitcoin to long-term storage, reducing the amount available for immediate sale. This supply constraint can create upward pressure on price, especially if demand continues to rise. Meanwhile, another Bitcoin analyst, apsk32, highlighted BTC\u2019s ongoing alignment with the power curve cycle. Remarkably, Bitcoin has followed this cycle consistently for 15 years, and if the trend holds, the next cycle top could occur in November or December 2025. BTC Quantity More Important Than Price In a separate X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki emphasized that the number of BTC one holds is more important than its current price. In a detailed thread, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 million by 2030. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Warning: Short-Term Holder Selling Accelerates Amid Price Correction While a $1 million price target may seem ambitious, other analysts also forecast new highs in the near term. For example, CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Aleman recently projected that BTC could top out at $205,000 by the end of 2025. In addition, exchange data suggests an impending supply crunch, as whales continue withdrawing large amounts of BTC while exchange inflows remain subdued.
