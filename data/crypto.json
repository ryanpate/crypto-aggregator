      "summary": "XRP&#8217;s market dominance may be on the verge of a historic breakout, with analyst Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) suggesting the token could command as much as 30% of the entire crypto market cap in this cycle\u2014representing a fivefold surge from current levels. 30% XRP Dominance? The bold projection stems from an emerging bullish structure on the XRP dominance chart, reinforced by a key technical signal: the three-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has broken its multi-year downtrend for the first time since XRP&#8217;s last local highs. This shift, visible on the attached chart, signals a significant change in market dynamics, potentially marking the beginning of a new accumulation-driven expansion. The analyst argues that XRP dominance has completed a textbook Wyckoff accumulation pattern. \u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much completed a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, and I would argue we\u2019re nearing the end of Phase D and about to enter Phase E,\u201d they noted. According to the Wyckoff method, Phase E represents the breakout phase, where assets typically enter strong markup periods after prolonged accumulation. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen This interpretation is supported by a side-by-side comparison of the theoretical Wyckoff schematic overlaid directly on XRP dominance price action. The analyst specifically points to the recent &#8220;Last Point of Support&#8221; (LPS) as confirmation that XRP is transitioning toward breakout territory, having already completed the \u201cSpring\u201d phase\u2014a final shakeout that traps late sellers before a sustained rally. &#8220;If that\u2019s correct, we should see significant upside in XRP dominance,\u201d the analyst continued, adding that the signal is particularly meaningful when viewed on the three-day timeframe, which filters out short-term noise and emphasizes broader cyclical trends. In terms of concrete targets, the analyst acknowledges that consensus among market participants remains modest, with many expecting a peak in XRP dominance around 14%. However, CryptoInsightUK argues this is a gross underestimation of potential upside in the event that XRP reclaims narrative leadership in the crypto space. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $9 In Euphoric Fifth Wave, Elliott Wave Analyst Predicts \u201cI believe we could push as high as 20%. There\u2019s even a possibility we reach broader capital inflows accompanying a Bitcoin breakout to new all-time highs. Many are calling for a top around 14% dominance, but I believe we could push as high as 20%,\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s even a possibility we reach 30%, though I\u2019m personally targeting the 20% zone, which would represent a 5x increase in dominance from current levels.\u201d XRP\u2019s current market dominance sits below 6%, making the analyst\u2019s 20\u201330% target not just ambitious but transformative. It would mark the first time since the early XRP rally days in 2017 that XRP commanded such a share of the crypto market. The broader context driving this thesis is the possibility of a liquidity-driven crypto cycle, catalyzed by Bitcoin achieving new highs and investor capital rotating into alternative assets. \u201cIf this coincides with Bitcoin breaking out to new all-time highs and broader capital flowing into the market, I believe we could witness a major price expansion for XRP\u2014one that few are currently expecting,\u201d the analyst added. At press time, XRP traded at $2.28. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-risks-downside-if-resistance-holds-2700-level-is-critical/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading above the $2,500 level, showing notable strength despite recent volatility across the broader crypto market. Since early May, ETH has been trapped in a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, struggling to establish a clear trend as both bulls and bears wait for confirmation. However, recent price action suggests growing momentum, with bulls maintaining control above key support zones. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low \u2013 Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis pointing to a decisive moment ahead for Ethereum. According to Runefelt, a breakout above the $2,700 resistance level is essential to ignite an impulsive move toward higher levels. Without that breakout, ETH risks remaining range-bound or revisiting lower demand zones. The current market structure, combined with positive sentiment surrounding altcoins and growing institutional interest in Ethereum, contributes to the optimism. Still, the coming days will be critical. A sustained move above $2,700 could open the door for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, while failure to break out may delay Ethereum\u2019s next major leg up. As Bitcoin trades just below its all-time highs, Ethereum\u2019s next move could also determine the short-term trajectory for the altcoin market at large. Ethereum Leads Altcoin Recovery Altcoins have been stuck in a prolonged bear market since 2022, with many tokens still trading well below their all-time highs. Amid this challenging backdrop, Ethereum has emerged as the leader of a potential recovery. Since its April lows, ETH has more than doubled in price, surging over 100% and reclaiming key support levels above $2,500. This sharp rebound suggests that a new bullish phase for Ethereum\u2014and potentially the broader altcoin market\u2014could be in the early stages. However, the optimism is tempered by growing macroeconomic risks. Recent U.S. data has raised concerns about systemic fragility, with rising Treasury yields and persistent inflation fueling uncertainty across risk assets. Investors remain cautious as higher yields could limit liquidity flows into crypto, particularly into speculative altcoins. According to Carl Runefelt, Ethereum\u2019s price structure is approaching a critical point. He highlights that ETH is currently trading within a rising wedge pattern\u2014a bearish formation that often precedes a sharp pullback. Runefelt warns that if Ethereum fails to break decisively above the $2,700 resistance level soon, the price may reject and fall toward lower support, potentially leading to a drastic correction. For now, Ethereum remains range-bound between $2,400 and $2,700. A confirmed breakout above the upper boundary could fuel continued bullish momentum and trigger a broader altcoin rally. But failure to hold current levels, especially with bearish macro pressure building, could signal that the recent gains were a temporary relief rally. Ethereum\u2019s next move will likely define the near-term direction for the entire altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Wyckoff Accumulation Hints At Explosive Q3 \u2013 $4K Level In Sight ETH Faces Key Resistance Amid Rising Momentum Ethereum is showing strength as it trades at $2,574.70, gaining over 2.2% in the last session. As shown in the 3-day chart, ETH has remained range-bound since early May, fluctuating between the $2,400 support and the $2,700 resistance. The latest move above the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), currently at $2,226 and $2,644, respectively, signals growing bullish momentum. However, Ethereum still faces a significant challenge near the 200-day SMA, currently sitting at $2,791, right below the critical $2,800 liquidity level. The price has tested this resistance zone multiple times without success, suggesting that a strong breakout above $2,700\u2013$2,800 is needed to initiate an impulsive move higher. Volume remains stable, and ETH\u2019s ability to hold recent gains hints at continued accumulation, but a lack of decisive follow-through could signal buyer exhaustion. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook If bulls manage to reclaim $2,800, it would open the door toward $3,000 and confirm a breakout from the multi-month range. On the downside, a failure to hold $2,500 could trigger a drop back toward $2,400 or even $2,200 if broader market conditions deteriorate. For now, ETH remains in a pivotal zone, and its next major move will likely determine broader altcoin momentum. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/chartist-slams-misleading-dogecoin-analysis/",
      "summary": "Technical analyst Kevin, better known on X as @Kev_Capital_TA, rekindled debate over Dogecoin\u2019s market structure on Sunday when he urged traders to ignore the \u201cnon-stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes\u201d and to concentrate on the two signals that have guided the meme-coin\u2019s price for more than two years. \u201cNot much has changed for Dogecoin here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t let the other analysts on this platform flood you with non stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes. We know what to watch for here.\u201d Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Kevin\u2019s view hinges on the weekly chart he posted on 26 June. At that time, Dogecoin (DOGE) was hovering near $0.166\u2014and, according to his chart, sitting directly on an ascending support cluster that has defined every major move since the 2022 bear-market washout. \u201cLooking at Dogecoin on the weekly time frame,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can see that ever since the bear market breakout on the weekly RSI back in 2022, any time DOGE has hit that level again\u2014which has happened five times now\u2014Doge has gone on to see major bounces. A failure of this weekly RSI level along with a failure of the $0.143-$0.127 level would be the line in the sand between longer term bearish price action or continued bull.\u201d Related Reading: The $1 Dogecoin Dream Is Alive: Chartist Lays Out Parabolic Scenario The chart shows Dogecoin sitting just millimetres above a confluence of the green 0.382 Fibonacci retracement ($0.13778), the upper boundary of a falling trend line that has been in force since May 2021 and the weekly 200 SMA and EMA. Previously, Kevin stated via X: \u201cWeekly 200 SMA and EMA are must holds for Dogecoin along with the macro .382 and down trending support.\u201d Beneath lies the horizontal \u201cline in the sand\u201d at $0.143-$0.127\u2014a zone Kevin has ring-fenced with bold yellow trend lines. Below the price pane, the weekly Relative Strength Index tells an equally focused story. Kevin has drawn a white band just above the 40-line; the yellow RSI profile has now tapped that band five times. Each tag coincided with a price trough circled in orange on the main chart. The oscillator\u2019s simple moving average (plotted in magenta) has curled below 50 but remains above the 40-support, keeping the pattern intact. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst\u2014Here\u2019s The Target Overhead, Kevin\u2019s chart maps a hierarchy of Fibonacci checkpoints: the 0.5 retracement at $0.18988 (red), the tightly stacked 0.618 ($0.26169) and 0.65 ($0.28548) (yellow), and the 0.786 ($0.41317) (blue). Two large violet supply boxes\u2014one between $1.00 and $1.30 and another around $2.20 and $2.70\u2014represent possible bull run targets. Kevin refrains from forecasting how quickly those zones might come into play, emphasising instead that holding the current support cluster is the single prerequisite for any higher-time-frame bullish thesis. The analyst also zoomed out to the broader digital-asset landscape in a Sunday follow-up. \u201cThe biggest moves for #Altcoins have yet to occur,\u201d he argued, tying potential break-outs to macro-economic easing. \u201cIf the macro leads us to further easing and the market sniffs that out \u2026 then the ingredients will be in place for a massive move higher on Alts. Altcoins have always required the proper ingredients to make a sustained out-performance over #BTC for months. We\u2019re closer than many understand; we just need a few more things to fall into place.\u201d For now, Kevin\u2019s message is stripped to its essentials: watch the weekly RSI band and the $0.143-$0.127 price shelf. As long as both survive, the chartist sees no reason to overhaul his structural bias\u2014no matter how crowded the Dogecoin commentary stream becomes. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.172.

      "title": "XRP Price Risks Breakdown To Next Support Level, Why $2.28 Is Important",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-risks-breakdown/",
      "summary": "The XRP price has been holding on pretty tightly to its support level above $2.2 and continues to be a major level of pushback for the bears. This has shown that buyers are beginning to make a comeback at this level amid predictions that it will be the bounce point for the next rally. Regardless of this, a crypto analyst still believes that this support remains at risk as bears continue to push down on the price, and the result could be a major price crash from here. XRP Price Could Stage A Classic Bear Trap While there has been some recovery in the crypto market and, by extension, the XRP price, there has not been enough momentum to show that this is a sustained increase. This is something that crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise alludes to in their latest analysis, warning that it is possible that the digital asset might end up seeing a classic bear trap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The reason behind this is the fact that there have been a number of bearish developments on the XRP price chart that suggest that the price is likely to go down. For one, a Change of Character toward the more bearish side puts sellers in the lead, and this usually signals the start of a bearish downturn. Another development that has rocked the altcoin is an inverse Cup and Handle pattern that is still in the process of playing out. The crypto analyst also explained that these developments, in addition to the break below the key support trendline, suggest that a crash is coming for the XRP price. From here, bears are already applying pressure that could result in a 10% crash. This would push the cryptocurrency back toward the previous support, and according to the analyst\u2019s chart, this lies just above the $2 level. What this means is that a crash from here also puts the altcoin at risk of falling below $2, something that would be incredibly bearish and could lead to freefall. Wait For Confirmation Before Moving MyCryptoParadise outlined that the best way to play this analysis is to wait for confirmation. With the bearish thesis, they explain that it is best to wait for the XRP price to see a \u201cproper pullback\u201d before they enter the market. This would increase the risk-to-reward ratio after the trend direction has been confirmed. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen However, there is also the possibility that the XRP price does not crash from here and that lies at the $2.28 level. The analyst explained that if the price is able to cleanly break above this level and make a successful close above $2.28, then it would invalidate the bearish thesis and mark a continuation of the uptrend. \u201cIn such a case, it&#8217;s better to stay patient and wait for clearer price action before making any decisions,\u201d the analyst said.

ADA price started a fresh increase from the $0.5650 support zone. The price is trading above $0.5750 and the 100-hourly simple moving average.

The pair could start a fresh increase it clears the $0.600 zone. Cardano Price Eyes Upside Break In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a decent upward move from the $0.5650 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA was able to recover above the $0.5750 and $0.580 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6107 swing high to the $0.5630 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5760 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading above $0.5750 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5925 zone. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6107 swing high to the $0.5630 low. The first resistance is near $0.60. The next key resistance might be $0.620. If there is a close above the $0.620 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.650 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.6650 in the near term. Another Decline In ADA? If Cardano\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.5920 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.5850 level and the 100 hourly SMA. The next major support is near the $0.5650 level. A downside break below the $0.5650 level could open the doors for a test of $0.5450. The next major support is near the $0.5320 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.
