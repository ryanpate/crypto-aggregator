      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-bullish-wave-builds/",
      "summary": "In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Grayhoood observed that Solana (SOL) is currently showing signs of a bullish trend. Over the past 24 hours, the price has climbed by 2.8%, with candlestick charts revealing a noticeable upward trajectory. Solana Stochastics And CCI Signal Short-Term Strength Earlier in the day, SOL briefly dipped to around $151 but managed to recover steadily, reaching a current price of $155.35. Grayhoood pointed out that this short-term strength is consistent with Solana\u2019s 7-day performance, which shows a modest 1.4% increase. However, the longer-term outlook remains volatile, with SOL still down by 3.9% over the past year. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs Grayhoood revealed that technical indicators are suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook for SOL. As price action continues to show signs of recovery, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is likely positioned in a neutral zone, indicating the recent uptick. This positioning allows space for further gains, but also signals a potential shift into overbought territory if SOL\u2019s price surges too rapidly. The Stochastic Oscillator and Commodity Channel Index (CCI) also point to short-term bullish momentum, especially with SOL breaking through the $154 resistance level. These indicators suggest that buyers are regaining control. However, Grayhoood cautioned that while momentum appears to be building, the recent price dip observed earlier in the day reveals that sellers are not entirely out of the picture. Recovery Gains Traction, But Yearly Losses Still Weigh In To further reinforce his claim, the analyst pointed to Solana\u2019s moving averages, which currently present a mixed but insightful technical outlook. In the short term, the 7-day and 14-day moving averages hint at a hold or mild buying pressure. This aligns with SOL\u2019s recent bounce from $151 to $155.35, signaling that momentum may be shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Solana\u2019s Old Hands Are Moving\u2014Is Trouble Brewing? However, when viewed from a broader lens, long-term averages continue to reflect lingering weakness. The 30-day and yearly trends, which show declines of 9.3% and 3.9% respectively, suggest that the larger market remains cautious. These figures reveal that while the recent gains are encouraging, they have not fully reversed the bearish structure seen over the past months. Overall, the analyst believes that despite the volatility seen over the past few weeks, market sentiment is beginning to lean bullish in the short term. Solana\u2019s recent performance, supported by its ability to reclaim key levels and maintain upward momentum, offers a more favorable outlook heading into the near future. If current trends persist and key resistances are successfully challenged, the path may open for a broader shift in sentiment. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-biblical-move-before-crash/",
      "summary": "XRP might be gearing up for a bullish run of epic proportions, accompanied by a similar crash of epic proportions. Particularly, a new technical analysis suggests that the XRP price may be preparing for one of its most explosive moves yet, followed by what the analyst calls a historic crash. This analysis comes amidst a backdrop of XRP reclaiming $2.2 in the past 24 hours, with the next outlook on reclaiming $2.3. Echoes of 2017: Hidden Bullish Divergence Reappears In a detailed breakdown shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst JD (@jaydee_757) drew parallels between the current setup of XRP&#8217;s price action and its 2017\u20132018 market cycle. Back then, XRP printed a hidden bullish divergence (HBD) on the Stochastic RSI indicator, which acted as a powerful signal for an eventual 20x surge. According to the analyst, XRP appears to be repeating the same structural formation, with a new hidden bullish divergence now confirmed once again on the two-week timeframe. Related Reading: Analysts Are Predicting XRP Price To Climb Above $20 In Unexpected Rally As shown in the two-week candlestick timeframe chart below, XRP has already broken out from a multi-year symmetrical triangle dating back to its peak in 2018. This breakout, paired with the hidden bullish divergence, sets the stage for a biblical price move. JD projects an immediate upside continuation once the current smaller triangle consolidation pattern resolves to the upside. This parabolic upside continuation is likely to push XRP toward levels last seen during its all-time high. In this case, the analyst projected a price move above the double-digit threshold, with a target around $17. Post-Rally Warning: 90% Crash Projection Follows However, JD&#8217;s analysis is not without caution. Just as the 2017 rally ended in a dramatic 94% crash from $3.4 to the $0.2 range, the analyst warned that the anticipated surge could lead to a similar fate. This trajectory is illustrated clearly in the chart above. Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Crash Below $2 As Correction Takes Hold, Here\u2019s Why After the anticipated euphoric move upward is complete, JD projects a sharp reversal toward a designated pink box area on the chart. This region, although not labeled with a specific price, lies well below current levels and may cause XRP to crash from double digits to below $1. Unfortunately, the majority of traders and investors could get rekt if they chase XRP near the peak. This follows similar behavior in 2018, where the parabolic rally was followed by an equally violent sell-off that trapped many traders at the top. As of now, XRP continues to coil within its consolidation triangle, and the breakout direction will likely determine the short-term fate of the cryptocurrency. XRP is currently trading at $2.28, up by 2.4% in the past 24 hours. A convincing break above the $3 mark would be necessary to invalidate the resistance of the current smaller triangle consolidation pattern and confirm the start of a parabolic move. Until then, there&#8217;s still a possibility that XRP will be rejected again at the triangle&#8217;s upper trendline. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Chainlink is set to play a major role as Hong Kong\u2019s central bank takes a big step in its digital currency tests. Phase two of the e-HKD pilot will try moving tokenized Hong Kong dollars across borders. The plan is to swap e-HKD for A$DC, an Australian dollar stablecoin. This could cut settlement times from days to seconds. It may also show how central banks can work together with blockchain technology. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Hong Kong And Australia Test Digital Cash According to reports, the project will use Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, or CCIP, to handle transfers. The goal is simple. Move money in real time and make sure both sides get what they expect. Phase two kicks off with Hong Kong authorities and their counterparts in Australia. They will swap e-HKD for A$DC and aim for instant settlement. Based on reports, this setup could serve as a model for other central banks. We\u2019re excited to share that Chainlink is facilitating the secure exchange of a Hong Kong CBDC and an Australian dollar stablecoin as part of an ongoing use case in Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program. Congratulations to participants @Visa, ANZ, China AMC, and Fidelity\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ts2C6Vt4Ul \u2014 Chainlink (@chainlink) June 9, 2025 Chainlink Tools In Use Chainlink is not just a name in the mix. It brings two big pieces of tech to the table. CCIP handles the cross-chain messages, acting like a bridge between different blockchains. The Digital Transfer Agent, or DTA, deals with compliance. It keeps track of who owns what token and makes sure rules in different countries are met. In May, World Liberty Financial tapped Chainlink for cross-chain stablecoin transfers covering USD1. That earlier deal hinted at what\u2019s possible this time around. Big Names Join The Pilot Visa and ANZ are helping with payment processing for e-HKD and A$DC. Asset managers Fidelity International and ChinaAMC will also take part. Their job is to manage the tokenized funds on both sides. This mix of banks, asset managers and tech firms shows the project is more than a small test. It has real money and real risks involved. Reports disclosed that those risks are managed by a Payment-versus-Payment model. This means funds are only released when both sides confirm they have received the other asset. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Market Moves And Reactions LINK, the token for Chainlink, jumped by 6% after news of the pilot broke. It now trades at $14.70. That rise follows a wider market rally driven by hopes that Bitcoin may hit $110,000 before the week\u2019s end. According to market data, crypto traders often chase big targets. Short-term gains can be tempting. But they can also lead to quick sell-offs if the main story fades. Despite the rally, Bitcoin still tracks the equity swings rather closely. There is a mix of bulls and bears in futures data that suggests some people are not yet convinced this run will last. High volatility can shake out weaker hands at the first sign of trouble. A sudden change in risk sentiment or a fresh macro shock can quickly reverse gains.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-liftoff-break-this-barrier-key-price-targets/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin skidded to a low near $0.168 last week before snapping higher to trade around $0.19 on Tuesday morning, up roughly six percent over 24 hours. The rebound unfolded in lock-step with bitcoin\u2019s own recovery from the technically charged $106,800 level to just above $109,000, re-invigorating short-term dip-buyers across the memecoin complex. Dogecoin Needs To Conquer This Price Level Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) argues that the Fib defence has restored bullish structure\u2014but only up to a point. \u201cAfter coming down to the .382 Fib Dogecoin finally found the support it needed along with BTC finding support at 100K,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs it goes for the immediate future of **DOGE it has a lot of work to do. Big resistance at .19-.21 cent range will need to be broken in order to head back up to that .26-.28 level. Indicators on the daily time frame look bullish.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s behaviour therefore remains pivotal. Spot BTC is hovering near $109,000 this morning and has so far defended the $106,800 pivot flagged by several high-profile analysts, including Michael van de Poppe, as the \u201clinchpin for a potential rally\u201d. Should Bitcoin extend toward the $120,000-$130,000 band, Kevin argues that Dogecoin will decouple from its dependence on the benchmark \u201cwhen dominance tops and the market sniffs out easing monetary policy.\u201d Crypto pundit Chandler (\u201c@ChandlerCharts\u201d) is less sanguine. Overlaying DOGE\u2019s four-day price against DOGE/BTC, market cap and a relative-strength oscillator, his graphic highlights three prior compression phases\u2014shaded grey\u2014where the memecoin failed to sustain outperformance against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive \u201cEven if DOGE breaks above its November highs, it won\u2019t feel great if DOGE/BTC ends up way lower than it was at the November highs,\u201d he cautioned. Chandler calculates that with BTC at $107,600, Dogecoin would have to print roughly $0.52 simply to reach a higher high against Bitcoin. \u201cIf BTC runs to $120-130k, DOGE needs to be around $0.60+ for holding DOGE to make sense over BTC.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The \u2018Next Impulse\u2019, Analyst Predicts That threshold underscores the importance of the $0.19-$0.21 supply zone visible on both analysts\u2019 charts. On Kevin\u2019s canvas it coincides with the 0.618-0.703 Fib cluster; on Chandler\u2019s, it overlaps the upper edge of an eighteen-month value area that has repeatedly rejected upside probes. A decisive close above $0.211 would place the May 11 summit at $0.2597 back in play and, more importantly for bulls. For now, traders are watching two numbers: $106,800 on Bitcoin and $0.21 on Dogecoin. A clean break of the latter would validate Kevin\u2019s bullish roadmap toward $0.26-$0.28 and, by extension, keep alive the possibility of Chandler\u2019s higher-high scenario on the DOGE/BTC cross. Until then, the memecoin\u2019s fate indeed \u201cremains in the hands of BTC\u2019s capability in heading higher.\u201d At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet has raised the possibility of the Ethereum price surging by 38% soon. He alluded to the 50EMA as the only thing holding ETH from witnessing this price surge, but suggested that it could change soon with a breakout on the horizon. Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that the Ethereum price could record a 38% surge to $3,500. This came following as he highlighted the ongoing battle between ETH and the 50EMA, noting that this indicator was the only thing holding the altcoin back from a parabolic surge. The analyst added that on average, a breakout results in a 38% pump, which puts Ethereum exactly at $3,500. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric As reported, Crypto Bullet also recently predicted that the Ethereum price could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern formed. Back then, he noted that ETH was facing tough resistance at $2,500 but affirmed that the resistance would be broken in due time. He indicated that a breakout from that resistance will usher in the rally to $3,300. The Ethereum price has now broken above the $2,500 resistance, which provides a bullish outlook for the largest altcoin by market cap. Based on Crypto Bullet\u2019s prediction, a rally to $3,300 may already be underway, which could then lead ETH to the $3,500 target. In a more recent X post, the crypto analyst commented on the recent break above $2,500. He stated that the Ethereum price is now trying to break the 200-day MA, which is between $3,000 and $3,300, for the fifth time. He indicated that a breakout above the range is likely to happen on this fifth attempt. His accompanying showed that ETH could rally to the $4,000 level if a successful breakout occurs. ETH About To Begin A New Bull Run Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted that another bull run is about to start for the Ethereum price. He noted that ETH\u2019s daily candle closed above the resistance level at $2,650 yesterday and also opened above this resistance level today. The analyst added that ETH is now moving above it, which signals the start of a new bull run. Related Reading: FTX Repayments About To Dump $5B On The Market, How Will Bitcoin And Ethereum React?
