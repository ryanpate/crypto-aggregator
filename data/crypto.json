      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/the-100k-mirage-bitcoins-rally-not-backed-by-on-chain-strength/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin briefly climbed back above $100,000 this month, pushing close to the $108,000 level before a new pullback. The move looks strong on the surface. But based on reports from Glassnode, much of that surge came from traders using borrowed funds, not fresh buyers piling in. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role Speculative Bets Fuel Recent Rally According to on-chain data, late-June\u2019s volume on Bitcoin futures stayed high as prices marched upward. Traders betting on short-term gains drove the market, even as the excitement behind the rally faded. Funding rates and the three-month futures basis both moved lower, signaling less bullish conviction. In other words, fewer people were making big, long bets on Bitcoin these days. Spot Market Remains Quiet Spot trading did not follow the futures boom. At its $111,910 peak in May, daily spot volume hovered around $7.65 billion. That\u2019s well below the previous cycle highs, which topped $20 billion on some days. Based on reports, new cash from retail or long-term holders stayed on the sidelines instead of flooding in. Institutional Buyers Still Adding Big firms did keep buying. This week saw Michael Saylor&#8217;s Strategy, Metaplanet and ProCap BTC together pick up about $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. At the same time, US-listed Bitcoin ETFs bought over $1.5 billion in fresh supply. Those steady purchases hint at genuine interest from institutions, even if short-term traders set the pace recently. Supply Tightness Could Drive Prices Glassnode now shows just 7 million BTC left freely available on exchanges. Roughly 14 million BTC are held by people who haven\u2019t moved their coins in ages. That supply squeeze could support prices if demand holds up. But it also means any sudden sell-off might hit hard when exchange wallets run low. What Comes Next For Bitcoin All in all, the recent jump above $100,000 feels more like a sprint by margin players than a marathon fueled by new believers. Corrections often follow rallies driven by heavy margin activity. Yet, the ongoing buying by big companies and ETFs offers a buffer. If they keep at it, Bitcoin may need a breather now but could rally again later. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble?

      "summary": "Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength, trading 75% above its April lows as bulls attempt to reclaim lost ground. Despite this impressive recovery, ETH still sits roughly 98% below its all-time highs, leaving significant room for growth if bullish momentum accelerates. Market sentiment is shifting, with many analysts and investors eyeing Ethereum as the leading candidate to spark the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms 4-Year Inverse H&#38;S Pattern \u2013 Neckline Break Could Send It Parabolic Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared a technical view suggesting that Ethereum has once again retested its lower channel \u2014 a pattern that has historically preceded explosive rallies in previous market cycles. In both 2017 and 2021, this same setup led to massive gains, and some believe this cycle could be no different. With macro conditions still uncertain but risk appetite growing across crypto markets, Ethereum\u2019s price action is being closely watched. If the pattern holds, ETH could be on the verge of a powerful breakout that pulls the broader altcoin market along with it. Whether this becomes a historic launchpad or another consolidation phase remains to be seen, but for now, Ethereum is clearly at the center of attention. Ethereum Holds Key Support As Historic Pattern Signals Bullish Potential Ethereum is trading at a crucial technical level after reclaiming the $2,400 mark, where bulls and bears are locked in a tug-of-war. Buyers have managed to defend the key support zone, but upward momentum remains muted as broader market sentiment remains cautious. Geopolitical tensions and tightening macroeconomic conditions continue to shape risk appetite, making many investors hesitant to fully commit to high-beta assets like Ethereum. Still, the long-term setup is attracting attention from seasoned analysts. Pillows points to a recurring historical pattern that could define Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the coming months. According to his analysis, ETH has retested its lower trend channel once in each major market cycle, and each retest has preceded extraordinary rallies. In 2017, Ethereum surged 300x from this setup. In 2021, it delivered a 50x return. If history even partially repeats itself, a conservative 6x move would send ETH above the $10,000 mark. The setup is technically sound and aligns with the broader sentiment that Ethereum could lead the next altcoin rally, especially if Bitcoin breaks into price discovery. While uncertainty remains, ETH\u2019s current position is a pivotal zone. If bulls manage to maintain structure and push toward range highs, the conditions for a breakout may soon align. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record High: 29.02% Of Supply Locked Signals Long-Term Conviction ETH Holds $2,400 Level But Faces Resistance Ethereum is consolidating around $2,422 after reclaiming the $2,400 support zone, but the chart shows that bulls face significant resistance just above current levels. On the 12-hour timeframe, ETH has struggled to break above the 50- and 100-period simple moving averages, currently sitting at $2,518 and $2,536, respectively. This cluster of resistance has capped every recent attempt to move higher, reinforcing it as a short-term barrier that bulls must overcome to regain momentum. ETH&#8217;s failed breakdown below $2,200 earlier this week now looks like a bear trap, as buyers stepped in aggressively to reclaim lost ground. Still, without a decisive break above $2,530, Ethereum remains vulnerable to another retest of the $2,300\u2013$2,200 support zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears \u2013 Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout The 200-period SMA near $2,160 remains a key downside level to watch \u2014 if price fails to hold above it on future dips, bears could regain control. For now, Ethereum appears to be range-bound, caught between macro uncertainty and bullish hopes for an altseason. A breakout above $2,550 would confirm renewed strength and open the door for a push toward $2,800. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

His name is Charles Shrem, the guy behind the Blockchain Backer channel on YouTube. He\u2019s been bullish on XRP for years. Now he\u2019s saying outright that the altcoin is a threat to Bitcoin. That claim comes at a time when the altcoin is still trailing behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears XRP\u2019s Rise And Fall Against Bitcoin According to charts, XRP jumped over 200% against Bitcoin from November 2024 to January 2025. That was an eye-popping move. Then things went south. Since February 2025, XRP lost about 30% against Bitcoin. Bitcoin, on the other hand, set new all-time highs after February. The crypto mostly hovered around $2. That big swing shows how fast fortunes can change in crypto markets. If it isn&#8217;t clear yet, XRP actually is a threat to Bitcoin. \u2014 Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) June 26, 2025 Analyst Calls XRP A Serious Challenger Based on reports, Shrem has hinted at this view in the past. But he never put it so bluntly until now. He says Bitcoin fans feel threatened by XRP\u2019s potential. He even pointed to online fights where Bitcoin maximalists blasted XRP and its backers. Shrem argues that those attacks prove it has real muscle behind it, at least in the minds of some big players. Trump\u2019s Digital Asset Stockpile Debate In January 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order asking a team to study a \u201cdigital asset stockpile.\u201d It didn\u2019t name Bitcoin or XRP. But the move sent shockwaves through crypto circles. The funny thing is\u2026 XRP was never mentioned in the executive order. But, the Bitcoiners have always known it\u2019s the threat for the crown. That\u2019s why the attack is on. They know. \u2014 Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) January 24, 2025 Some Bitcoin supporters blamed XRP and Ripple\u2019s boss, Brad Garlinghouse, for pushing to include the altcoin. That blew up into a heated online conflict. Shrem sees that clash as more proof of XRP\u2019s rising profile. Bitcoiners are openly advertising that XRP may be a threat to overthrow Bitcoin. \u2014 Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) January 24, 2025 Market Cap Gap Remains Wide XRP still has a long way to go. It trades at about $2.19 and boasts a market cap of $129.4 billion. Ethereum sits second with $295 billion. The crypto would need a 135% rise to hit $5. To match Bitcoin\u2019s $2.125 trillion, the altcoin&#8217;s price must surge about $1,620% to $36. Back in October, analyst Dark Defender said XRP could reach $36. That call sounds bold today. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role Overcoming A Big Lead In Adoption XRP\u2019s fast moves get people talking.

For now, Shrem\u2019s claim makes good headlines. Whether XRP can turn that talk into market gains is another question. For crypto fans, it\u2019s one of the storylines to watch in the months ahead.

      "summary": "According to a recent analytics, stablecoins handled 35 trillion in on-chain transaction volume over the past year, with their average supply hovering around 195 billion. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears Those numbers show how much these tokens fuel trades, loans and cross-border transfers. Yet questions about whether they really count as \u201cmoney\u201d are now front and center. Stablecoin On-Chain Traffic Based on reports, stablecoins have become the workhorses of crypto trading. Volume hit 35 trillion in the last 12 months. At the same time, their circulating supply stayed at 194.6 billion. That steady supply suggests tokens like USDC and USDT are parked, ready for the next move. Traders shift them in and out of Bitcoin and altcoins. Payment platforms weave them into digital rails. The scale is hard to ignore. IMF Deputy MD Raises Money Question According to IMF Deputy Managing Director Bo Li, the big challenge is classification. Are stablecoins part of M0, M1 or a new category altogether? He posed those questions at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos. Getting that wrong could reshape how banks set reserves and how regulators cut red tape. Li also pointed out that policy experiments are popping up all over. Some of them may not survive a real stress test. Key Takeaways: IMF\u2019s Bo Li said regulatory uncertainty around stablecoins persists, especially regarding classification and enforcement.

Europe has drafted its own rulebook. Over in Asia, Hong Kong plans to roll out its Stablecoin Ordinance in August 2025. Those efforts show a strong push to make rules more clear. But they also underscore a lack of global unity. Businesses could face one set of rules in New York, another in Brussels and a third in Hong Kong. That patchwork approach risks adding costs for firms and confusion for users. Global Bodies Seek Cooperation According to Bo Li\u2019s remarks, fragmented rules carry real risks. He warned that gaps in enforcement might let bad actors slip through. To avoid that, the IMF is teaming up with the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee. Their goal is to craft more consistent guidance. If they pull it off, regulators in different countries might follow a shared playbook rather than compete by cutting corners.

      "title": "Ethereum Daily Transactions Just Hit Its Highest Level Since January 2024, Will Price Follow?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-daily-transactions/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has seen a notable spike in its daily transactions after a week filled with uncertain market movement. While the rise in the daily transactions has caught attention, what is really essential to point out is that it has been a long time since the daily transactions have been this high. In fact, the spike has led to the highest level that Ethereum&#8217;s daily transactions have been in over 16 months, showing a return to the blockchain that seemed previously abandoned. Ethereum Daily Transactions Cross 1.7 Million According to data from the on-chain data aggregation website, Nansen, the Ethereum daily transaction count has spiked by almost 50% over the last few days. The week had begun with the daily transaction count sitting at 1.2 million on Monday. However, by Wednesday, this figure was already changing rapidly to reach new yearly peaks. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place As the Ethereum price rose above $2,400, so did participation on the blockchain, leading daily transactions to rise to 1.729 million. This sharp spike has led to the highest level so far in 2025, and is the first time since January 2024 that the daily transactions has crossed the 1.7 million mark. At the same time, there was also an unusual spike in the daily active addresses, which rose by almost 50% as well in the same time period. The daily active addresses rose from 345,406 addresses to 593,637 addresses in the space of four days. All of these have happened as the Ethereum price has recovered, suggesting that the spike in on-chain participation is actually more from investors buying than selling. If this trend continues, then it could send the Ethereum price soaring higher from here. Sell Volume Begins Dominating ETH Price In contrast to the rise in Ethereum on-chain participation, there has also been an increase in the on-chain sell volume compared to the buy volume. Nansen data points out that in the $168.37 million on-chain buy volume recorded in a 24-hour period, approximately $78.15 million was going toward buys, while a little over $90 million was from sellers. Related Reading: Ethereum Not Out Of The Woods Yet: Why Another 30% Crash To $1,800 Is Coming Furthermore, when it comes to individual transactions involved in buying and selling Ethereum, the sellers remain in the lead. There were more than 52,000 buy transactions recorded during this period, with around 24,300 buyers. While the sell transactions ran up towards 74,000, with sellers at more than 32,000. This shows a higher percentage of sellers compared to buyers, which would explain why the price has been unable to reach other support levels. This rise in the selling volume suggests that the buys are not enough to absorb the selling volume. This could fight off any buying momentum that could lead to a price recovery and keep the Ethereum price down while the crypto market struggles to find its footing.
