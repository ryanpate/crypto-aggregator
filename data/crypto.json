      "summary": "Crypto analyst Colin has highlighted the Bitcoin price\u2019s deviation from the Global M2 money supply, raising concerns that the bull run may be over. The analyst quickly addressed concerns, noting how such deviations usually happen at some point but don\u2019t invalidate the macro trend. Analyst Highlights Bitcoin Price\u2019s Deviation From Global M2 Money Supply In an X post, Colin revealed that the Bitcoin price has deviated from the global M2 money supply. He noted that this deviation was short-term in an otherwise broad correlation. The analyst added that this current deviation is similar to the position that BTC was in February 2025. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What\u2019s Next Colin remarked that this development doesn\u2019t mean the M2 is broken, just as it wasn\u2019t broken back in February. Instead, he claimed that it just means that market participants haven\u2019t zoomed out enough and are allowing for the non-correlated periods. The analyst added that non-correlation between the Bitcoin price and global M2 money supply happens 20% of the time. He then alluded to the regular chart, which shows the strong correlation between the Bitcoin price and the global M2 money supply. Colin explained that the M2 is \u201cdirectionally predictive\u201d for BTC and that it is not 1:1 price-related. The analyst further remarked that the M2 does not predict a specific BTC price. Instead, the global M2 money supply only predicts the market direction, with about 80% accuracy. Colin added that the Bitcoin price has its y-axis while the M2 is on a different y-axis. He also opined that the M2 may decouple from BTC near the cycle top. Although the analyst didn\u2019t provide a timeline for when the cycle top will be, his analysis indicates that the cycle top is not yet in and the bull run isn\u2019t over. Money Supply Shows No Need To Worry About BTC Price In an X post, market expert Raoul Pal suggested that the Bitcoin price\u2019s correlation with the money supply shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. He remarked that if 89% of BTC\u2019s price action is explained by global liquidity, then by definition, almost all \u201cnews\u201d and \u201cnarrative\u201d is noise. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 This suggests that the current geopolitical risks, heightened by the Israel-Iran conflict, are unlikely to impact the Bitcoin price as much as expected. Trading firm QCP Capital recently noted that the flagship crypto has yet to show full-blown panic, which shows how much the asset has matured. The firm remarked that BTC\u2019s resilient price action appears underpinned by continued institutional accumulation, with companies like Strategy and Metaplanet buying the dip. The Bitcoin ETFs also continue to record positive flows. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $104,700, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/ton-eye-fresh-momentum/",
      "summary": "Toncoin (TON) has been quietly building strength, defending the $2.80\u2013$2.95 support zone with remarkable consistency. After weeks of consolidation, the recent break above a falling trendline has caught traders&#8217; attention, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. As TON coils just above this key structure, the stage may be set for a breakout \u2014 one that could ignite fresh upside if bullish pressure continues to build. Buyers Defend Key Levels On The Chart In a recent post on X, Alts King pointed out that TON is showing notable strength as it continues to hold above the $2.80\u2013$2.95 support zone. This range has acted as a reliable floor for several weeks, with buyers consistently stepping in to defend it. Related Reading: TON Bullish Pattern Signals Breakout Ahead \u2014 40% Rally Loading? Furthermore, Alts King further observed that a falling trendline, which has long constrained TON\u2019s price action, has now been broken. This technical breakout could mark the early stages of a trend reversal, opening the door for a more sustained bullish move. Looking forward, Alts King believes that if the support zone continues to hold firm, TON may be setting up for a potential rally toward the $6.87 level. To validate this bullish thesis, Alts King recommends watching for the formation of higher highs and higher lows on shorter timeframes. These structural patterns are key indicators of healthy upward movement and would confirm growing confidence among market participants as TON tries to shift out of its consolidation phase. Resistance Zones That May Test TON Momentum To $6.87 As TON begins to show signs of renewed strength, its path toward the $6.87 target isn\u2019t without resistance. One of the first major hurdles lies around $3.04, a support level turned into resistance during the last sell-off. Price action near this range has already shown hesitation in the past, making it a critical level for bulls to reclaim convincingly. Related Reading: Toncoin Open Interest Spikes 33%\u2014Will History Repeat With A Pullback? Above that, the $4.54 level could serve as the next challenge. This zone aligns with prior swing highs and consolidations seen on the daily chart, where TON was previously rejected before resuming downward movement. Breaking through this level would require strong volume and confirmation, especially as traders may look to take profits from lower entries near the $2.80 support base. Finally, before TON can reach the anticipated $6.87 resistance, it must clear the psychological barrier around $6.00, which also coincides with a rounded top structure observed during a prior rally. This level may attract selling pressure from short-term traders aiming to lock in gains. However, only with sustained bullish momentum and the formation of higher highs can TON overcome these layers of resistance and build a real case for a breakout beyond $6.87.

      "summary": "Ethereum is approaching a critical test as price action tightens, setting the stage for a decisive move above key demand. After weeks of volatile yet controlled trading, bulls are attempting to reclaim higher ground, but momentum remains limited. At the same time, bears have repeatedly failed to drive ETH below the $2,400 level, reinforcing it as a strong support zone for now. With global markets under pressure from geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, Ethereum\u2019s next move could define the direction of the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close \u2013 Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent Top analyst M-log1 believes the ETH/BTC pair is the most important chart to monitor in the coming days. According to his view, a breakout\u2014either to the upside or downside\u2014will determine the fate of altcoins across the board. The setup has reached an inflection point after multiple tests of the lower support band, with bulls continuing to defend it against breakdown attempts. This consolidation phase, combined with suppressed volatility and rising macro tension, makes Ethereum\u2019s current structure one of the most significant technical formations in crypto right now. All eyes are now on ETH/BTC as traders prepare for what could be a defining moment in the altcoin cycle. Ethereum Builds Pressure As Breakout Nears Ethereum continues to trade within a narrow range that began in early May, hovering between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels. This prolonged consolidation comes at a time of growing geopolitical instability, as the conflict in the Middle East escalates and macroeconomic uncertainty grips global markets. While many investors had anticipated an altseason by now, that rotation of capital into altcoins has yet to materialize. All eyes remain on Ethereum to serve as the catalyst for that next leg higher. M-log1 believes the ETH/BTC pair holds the most important signal in the coming days. \u201cThis is probably the most important chart you want to keep an eye on,\u201d he stated, highlighting that whichever direction ETH/BTC breaks could determine the fate of the altcoin market. The chart has repeatedly tested the lower support range, with bulls successfully defending that level on at least eight occasions. According to M-log1, this persistent defense suggests that bears are losing momentum, and a breakout to the upside is more likely. \u201cI am 80/20 in favor of the upside,\u201d he said, citing the market\u2019s inability to break lower as a sign of underlying strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern \u2013 $4,000 Is The Trigger Point ETH Tests Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,550, maintaining its position above all major weekly moving averages\u201450, 100, and 200. This level marks a key technical pivot as price consolidates between $2,450 and $2,680 after a strong recovery from its April low near $1,500. Despite multiple attempts to break higher, ETH continues to face resistance just below the $2,700 mark, showing that sellers remain active near historical supply zones. Importantly, the recent weekly candles have held the 100-week and 200-week simple moving averages as support. This indicates structural strength, especially considering the broader macro uncertainty driven by Middle East tensions and tighter U.S. monetary policy. Volume remains steady, with no signs of panic selling, further supporting the idea that ETH is stabilizing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low \u2013 No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet The current compression in price around key moving averages typically precedes a larger directional move. A confirmed weekly close above $2,700 could open the door to a rapid push toward the psychological $3,000 level. Conversely, losing the $2,400 support would likely trigger a short-term correction back toward the 50-week SMA near $2,289. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-2026-pattern-with-2017/",
      "summary": "The XRP price is currently trading well below $3; however, a crypto expert believes that in less than two years, this popular altcoin could enter the double-digit territory, marking a historic moment in crypto. The analyst has forecasted a potential surge to $27, pointing to a re-emerging pattern from 2017. With over six months left before 2026 begins, the expert has outlined a clear roadmap of how XRP could reach this bullish target if it completely mirrors the historic fractal. XRP Price Prediction For 2026 A new technical analysis by X (formerly Twitter) market expert Egrag Crypto suggests that XRP has yet to see its biggest breakout. The trajectory of the analyst\u2019s chart mirrors the same technical path that XRP followed before hitting its 2018 peak and current all-time high of $3.84. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move Coming? Egrag Crypto highlights that XRP is on the verge of an explosive rally that may extend into 2026, with current market behavior echoing the conditions and buildup that preceded its 2017 breakout. Notably, the analyst\u2019s price chart shows that the XRP monthly candle structure went through six candles of consolidation before it launched into a parabolic rise in late 2017. Now, the cryptocurrency has consolidated for seven monthly candles, highlighted by the green triangle in the chart. If the eight completes, the analyst expects a dramatic \u201cKABOOM phase\u201d to follow\u2014one that could propel XRP to price levels not seen before. The bullish projections point to a possible blow-off top somewhere between $22 and $27, aligning with the highest blue arc on the chart. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.15, meaning a surge to $27 would represent a whopping 1,156% in less than two years. With July 2025 highlighted as the potential trigger month, Egrag Crypto believes that the breakout could extend its momentum toward the end of 2025 and peak in 2026. The formation, known as the RGB Arcs, presents a visual roadmap of this projected bullish path\u2014reinforcing the possibility that XRP is preparing to repeat history\u2014only bigger. XRP To Reach $4 Before $27 Target In his analysis, Egrag Crypto\u2019s chart spanned from 2013 through 2017, connecting XRP\u2019s peaks to a series of colored parabolic curves. The red arcs in the chart represented the macro support line, while the green arc marked historical resistance levels\u2014reached in 2018, and now projected for 2025-2026. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Perfect Setup After Buy Retest \u2013 Next Stop $3.7 Notably, the analyst predicts that XRP\u2019s first breakout zone lies between $4 and $5. Once this target is hit, the cryptocurrency is expected to move into the upper green and blue arcs, positioning it for a stronger surge toward the forecasted $27 peak. Egrag Crypto has described this initial target as a measured move, where the final outcome is solely based on historical price patterns rather than pure speculation. He urges the broader XRP community to remain strong and patient until the cryptocurrency progresses toward these levels. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/crypto-analyst-4-dogecoin-exhausted-selling-phase/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s six-month consolidation is a coil, not a coffin, according to the pseudonymous technician Cantonese Cat, whose 19 June video marshals multiple time-frame evidence to argue that the meme-coin\u2019s next directional break will be up\u2014potentially as far as $4.13 before the current cycle tops out. Dogecoin Breakout Is Only A Matter Of Time The analyst begins by addressing sentiment. Retail comment threads have turned caustic, he notes, because price has slipped from last autumn\u2019s spike and then \u201cdone nothing for months.\u201d Yet such fatigue is precisely what bull-market retracements are meant to produce: \u201cA lot of people are getting really bitter about Doge \u2026 that\u2019s exactly how higher highs and higher low type situations are supposed to get you all frustrated. This is still a bull trend until proven otherwise.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like \u2018It Wants To Play Dead\u2019\u2014Again At the highest zoom level, Dogecoin is tracing what he calls \u201cstill a cup and \u2026 still a handle until proven otherwise.\u201d The first thrust of that handle halted almost exactly at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement of the 2022\u201324 bear range\u2014\u201ca very important fib level here.\u201d Because initial attempts rarely pierce that resistance, he expected rejection. What matters is where the pullback found support: \u201cIn the case of Dogecoin, it decided to go all the way down to 0.382, which is nothing unusual \u2026 this is actually a pretty important zone of this nice Adam-and-Eve double bottom.\u201d The market is therefore testing, not violating, an historically powerful neckline. Zooming to the monthly chart, Dogecoin sits beneath what the analyst calls \u201ca pretty thick Ichimoku cloud.\u201d Two breakout attempts have failed, producing a pair of wicks that look ominous to casual chart watchers. Cantonese Cat disagrees: \u201cWe had a little bit of a false breakout here on the monthly \u2026 I think a third time is going to be the charm.\u201d Beneath the cloud, six consecutive monthly candles have nested entirely inside the tall green bar printed last November. He interprets the formation\u2014six inside bars\u2014as latency building for a violent move: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about consolidation with six inside candles forming a lot of energy here.\u201d That compression is mirrored on the weekly time frame: \u201cIf you also look at the weekly here, you can also see that you have six inside candles over here too \u2026 that tells me that there is not much bearish energy necessarily left anymore. I think we\u2019re closer to the bottom than the top.\u201d Key structural support is supplied by a rising 20-month simple moving average, now at $0.1737. Price currently ticks below it, but the slope is still positive. Historically, such combinations resolve in favour of the trend: \u201cIf you have a 20-month moving average that is up-sloping, most likely this is just going to be a wick.\u201d He cites an earlier cycle when Dogecoin wicked beneath the same metric before staging a dramatic reversal. Price action, he argues, is meaningless without context. \u201cIf I end up looking at Doge here on Coinbase and I pull up the volume here, you can also see that there is no selling volume here at all.\u201d Binance, the world\u2019s deepest Dogecoin market, shows identical inertia. \u201cThe selling volume is essentially non-existent,\u201d he says, concluding that supply overhang has vaporised and only demand is required to propel a reversal. Twice before\u2014in July 2023 and February 2024\u2014identical volume droughts preceded V-shaped rallies: \u201cLow selling volume over here, reversal once volume comes in \u2026 low selling volume over here, reversal once volume comes in.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Shows Signs Of Life With Bottoming Signal Daily-chart oscillators are beginning to corroborate the structural read. Dogecoin has just registered what Cantonese Cat labels a \u201ctreasure bottom\u201d\u2014his term for a localised capitulation whose candle body is far smaller than its wick. More formally, the relative-strength index has exhibited bullish divergence: price has etched lower lows while RSI turns higher. \u201cLast time when you have some bullish diversions was right here \u2026 that was the local bottom right there,\u201d he says, pointing to the October 2023 reversal. The pattern repeated in March 2024 and appears again today: \u201cI think that we might be experiencing a trend change here relatively soon.\u201d DOGE Price Targets Should volume arrive and price claw back through the 0.5 and 0.618 retracements, Cantonese Cat\u2019s Fibonacci ladders flag successive targets. From the Binance dataset, \u201c$1.60, $2.26 and $4.13, all of these are possibility for Dogecoin.\u201d A composite feed of multiple exchanges tweaks the numbers to $1.50, $2.27 and $3.94. What he does not foresee is a reprise of 2021\u2019s parabolic blow-off, when Dogecoin tagged the 2.272 extension and briefly suggested a trajectory towards $23. \u201cI think that $23 doge is insane \u2026 I don\u2019t think that doge is going to end up becoming, you know, like anything like $3 trillion market cap.\u201d A quarter- to half-trillion-dollar capitalisation, however\u2014roughly the price zone between three and four dollars\u2014remains \u201csomething to think about\u201d given current monetary expansion. Cantonese Cat interprets the community\u2019s malaise as a contrarian gift: \u201cThe market makers are giving us more time to buy while the sentiment is extremely, extremely poor.\u201d Inside-bar ranges serve as a simple trigger. A close above the six-month range high would, in his reading, unlock the primary up-trend\u2019s next leg. Conversely, a close below the 20-month average might delay\u2014but not necessarily invalidate\u2014the thesis, provided the moving average itself keeps rising. Across every lens\u2014the macro cup-and-handle, the Adam-and-Eve neckline test, Ichimoku resistance, 20-month moving average support, volume exhaustion, daily bullish divergence\u2014the weight of evidence converges on a bullish outcome. Timing, he concedes, is unknowable: \u201cWhen is that going to be? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Yet none of the data justify capitulation. He closes with the maxim he repeats three times in the broadcast: \u201cThe trend is your friend, and the trend is up.\u201d If that view holds, Dogecoin\u2019s dormant coil may eventually unwind toward the analyst\u2019s most ambitious extension at $4.13\u2014a level unthinkable to today\u2019s demoralised sellers, and precisely for that reason, he argues, still within reach. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.171. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
