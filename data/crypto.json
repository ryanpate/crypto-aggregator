      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-risk-20-crash-to-1-55/",
      "summary": "XRP has once again landed at an important support level that places it in view of a rebound upwards or at risk of a further 20% crash. According to technical analyst CasiTrades, the recent drop was anticipated for weeks, and the precision with which XRP touched the $2.01 zone has added weight to its importance. The analyst noted that the drop out of the symmetrical triangle consolidation was clean and technically sound, and the $2.01 level has so far acted as the level for an upward bounce. Technical Setup Says Danger Zone Below $2.00 Still Active XRP price action in the past few days has been marked by a downtrend. XRP lost the $2.13 price level over the weekend before eventually cascading to a crash below $2 in the past 24 hours. Particularly, XRP crashed to bottom out at $1.92 before staging a rebound back above $2, at least at the time of writing. Related Reading: XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge \u2013 Is A Major Move Coming? As it stands, XRP is now back to trading at $2.01, a price level that holds utmost importance for its price action in the coming days. According to a technical analysis posted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst CasiTrades, $2.01 is important for XRP, as it coincides with a major 0.618 Fib support level. Supporting this view is a visible bullish divergence forming on both the 15-minute and 1-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI), as depicted on the price chart below. However, the analyst was quick to warn that confirmation is still lacking on the higher 4-hour and daily timeframes. Without these confirmations, the bounce could still be nonexistent, and XRP could crash strongly below $2. XRP is currently at risk unless buyers manage to push its price into higher confirmation zones, specifically into the $3.00 range. According to CasiTrades, if any bounce at $2.01 fails to carry through, XRP could be headed for its next supports at $1.90 and then $1.55. The latter represents a rough 23% drop from current levels, a scenario that would invalidate the bullish RSI divergence on the smaller timeframes. Geopolitical Tensions Causing XRP Price Volatility The timing of XRP\u2019s sharp drop over the weekend coincided with reports of geopolitical unrest, particularly the reported bombing of Iran by the US. This event caused widespread volatility in the crypto market, which was opened over the weekend. Related Reading: Why The XRP Price Risks A Crash To $0.9 As Bearish Pressures Mount Although the decline seems to be pausing in recent trading hours, it does not yet qualify as a bounce. XRP price is currently fragile, and without a reaction from buyers or confirmation across higher timeframes, the structure is bearish. Selling pressure from new geopolitical tensions or algorithmic moves could potentially lead to deeper declines during the new week, especially if $2.00 fails to hold. In that case, XRP could be on track to retest the $1.90 support and even collapse toward the $1.55 before the end of the week. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.01, down by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "title": "Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-crash-far-from-over-analyst/",
      "summary": "The price of Dogecoin continues to bleed, and crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) warns that the worst may still lie ahead. Citing an earlier bearish pattern, Kevin emphasized over the weekend that Dogecoin\u2019s Head and Shoulders formation\u2014identified nearly two weeks ago\u2014is rapidly approaching its technical \u201cmeasured move\u201d target. But he also made it clear that the full downside potential has not yet played out. Dogecoin Collapse Far From Over? \u201cI didn\u2019t say we are there now,\u201d Kevin clarified in a follow-up post, \u201cthe orange circle represents a zone of where the measured move could go, with a precise measured move target of the .786 fib at .119.\u201d This $0.119 level aligns with a broader confluence of technical supports that are quickly becoming critical for DOGE\u2019s structure. \u201cThe Head n Shoulders I pointed out on Dogecoin almost a couple of weeks ago is almost at its measured move target range. Certain daily indicators are also starting to enter inciting levels. Watching closely along with BTC and USDT Dominance for further confirmations,\u201d he wrote. Kevin also highlighted the importance of the weekly 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), along with the macro .382 Fibonacci retracement and a long-term descending trendline. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $4 Dogecoin After Exhausted Selling Phase Together, these levels form what he described as the \u201cmust-hold\u201d zone, specifically between $0.1434 and $0.1265. A sustained breakdown below that region would likely confirm a macro bearish shift for the meme asset. What To Monitor Now Zooming out, Kevin sees Dogecoin\u2019s fate as inseparably tied to Bitcoin and the wider altcoin market, which he describes as being in its weakest state in years. \u201cSo far 2025 has been more bearish for altcoins than 2024 and 2023,\u201d he noted. \u201cWorst year for Alts since the bear market in 2022.\u201d The overwhelming strength of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been a key factor in that trend. That dominance, Kevin argues, is not a temporary spike. \u201cFresh highs for BTC Dominance on the back of restrictive monetary policy and an uncertain geopolitical environment,\u201d he wrote, referring to global macro conditions including persistent quantitative tightening (QT). He has long warned that without a pivot in central bank policy, any talk of a true \u201caltseason\u201d is premature. Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like \u2018It Wants To Play Dead\u2019\u2014Again \u201cBeen saying since late 2023, early 2024\u2014when AI coins were running crazy and people were saying it was #Altseason\u2014that until QT ends and the terminal rate comes down, you will not see real sustainable altcoin outperformance. That continues to hold true.\u201d His caution extends well beyond Dogecoin. In previous posts, Kevin identified key danger zones for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which he argues must be reclaimed to prevent broader market deterioration. \u201cAs long as BTC cannot break the $106.8K level and show real follow-through on 3D-1W time frames, then the market is in real danger,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSame for ETH not being able to break the $2700-2800 level.\u201d For Dogecoin traders, the message is clear. The meme coin\u2019s fate rests not just on its own technical health, but on a wider macro and intermarket structure that remains fragile. As long as Bitcoin struggles to hold above key breakout levels and US monetary conditions remain tight, the probability of a deeper Dogecoin correction remains high. Whether DOGE can stabilize above the $0.1265 level will be closely watched by traders in the days and weeks ahead. A loss of that zone, especially in conjunction with renewed Bitcoin weakness, could mark the beginning of a deeper and more painful phase for the once-beloved meme coin. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.152. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-battles-key-support-daily-ema-100-must-hold-to-prevent-deep-correction/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin briefly fell below the critical $100,000 level over the weekend, reaching a low of approximately $98,200 and triggering a wave of panic selling across crypto markets. The sharp drop came after news broke of US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move that significantly escalated the already volatile conflict between Israel and Iran. The geopolitical shock sent global markets into risk-off mode, with Bitcoin reacting quickly to the growing uncertainty. Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure \u2013 Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 Despite the weekend dip, BTC has since reclaimed the $100K mark, but sentiment remains fragile. Investors are now watching key technical levels closely to determine the next move. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Bitcoin must hold the daily EMA-100 to avoid further downside pressure. A decisive close below this level could open the door for a deeper correction, especially if macroeconomic and geopolitical risks persist. As volatility spikes and fear grows, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to maintain support at these levels may define whether the bull cycle continues or enters a prolonged consolidation phase. All eyes are now on the $100K zone, which has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears in a market driven by both technicals and global tension. Bulls Defend $100K As Dominance Rises and Market Faces Crucial Test Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal moment. After dipping below the psychological $100,000 level over the weekend amid growing geopolitical tensions, BTC quickly reclaimed this critical threshold, offering a glimmer of hope to market participants. Although bulls managed to push the price back up, the overall structure remains fragile, and technical indicators now carry more weight than ever. Ted Pillows noted in a recent update that Bitcoin must hold its daily EMA-100 to preserve bullish momentum. A daily close below $99,000 would confirm a break below this key support zone, likely triggering a retest of the $92,000\u2013$94,000 region. Such a move could create significant downside pressure, particularly on altcoins, which are already lagging behind in performance. In Pillows&#8217; words, \u201cIf Bitcoin loses this level, alts will be annihilated.\u201d Despite the looming risks, fundamentals remain solid. Bitcoin dominance continues to hover near its highest levels of the year, reflecting growing investor preference for BTC over high-beta assets during uncertain times. On-chain metrics still indicate strong holder conviction, and macro narratives continue to favor Bitcoin as a hedge amid fiat instability and rising geopolitical uncertainty. If Bitcoin can hold the $100K level and reclaim momentum, it could lead to renewed strength and eventually a push toward the $109K resistance zone. For now, however, bulls are on the defensive. Price action over the next few days will likely define the trajectory for the remainder of Q3, with a close watch on EMA support, macro headlines, and risk sentiment across global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Chart Nears Tower Top Formation As US Launches Attack On Iran \u2013 Details Bitcoin Struggles Below Resistance Amid Bearish Price Structure The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin reveals a bearish structure following the breakdown below the $103,600 support zone. After forming a symmetrical triangle throughout mid-June, BTC failed to break upward and instead reversed direction, confirming a downward breakout. This move triggered a sharp decline to $98,200 over the weekend, followed by a modest recovery to the current $101,250 level. The price is now trading below both the 50 and 100-period simple moving averages, which are beginning to curl downward, signaling a shift in momentum away from bulls. The 200-period SMA, currently near $95,600, stands as the next major support if downside pressure continues. Volume has picked up notably on the red candles, adding weight to the bearish case and confirming active selling during the recent drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move Bitcoin must reclaim the $103,600 zone and hold above it to invalidate the bearish pattern and regain control. Failure to do so could result in further downside toward $95,000 and possibly even $92,000. As long as BTC remains below the broken triangle support and the $103K resistance, the path of least resistance remains downward. Bulls face an uphill battle, and confidence may erode quickly if the $100K psychological level is breached again. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

Crypto analyst Finsends has commented on this development and how it could affect the altcoin season moving forward. What\u2019s Next As Bitcoin Dominance Hits New High? In an X post, Finsends stated that the Bitcoin dominance has made a new high and that it feels like it can never go down again. However, he opined that there should be a bigger correction starting somewhere around the current levels. The analyst added that the potential target area for a top in this scenario goes up to 68.56%. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here\u2019s Why His accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin dominance could hit this projected top of 68.56% in July, after which a decline would begin. Based on the chart, the BTC.D could drop to as low as 48% on this decline, paving the way for a potential altcoin season. If so, then altcoins could witness significant gains in the second half of the year and outperform BTC in the process. In an X post, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe also commented on the rising Bitcoin dominance and a potential altcoin season. He noted that the altcoin season indicator has hit its lowest number in two years. The analyst added that the lows of this indicator over the last six years were in June or July. Based on this, he remarked that there seems to be a pattern since the indicator has hit a low again this June. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe didn\u2019t predict when exactly altcoin season could begin or if the Bitcoin dominance would top anytime soon. However, before now, he had expressed confidence that the alt season would still happen. The analyst noted that the last cycle was also called a Bitcoin cycle until altcoins started to run and heavily outperformed. What Needs To Happen For Altcoins To Take Off In another X post, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stated that altcoins are in need of an upward push from Ethereum, and that this needs to happen through a push of Bitcoin. He further remarked that once the BTC price bottoms out, that is a very likely moment for Ethereum to continue outperforming the flagship crypto, with the Bitcoin dominance declining. Related Reading: Analyst Calls Start Of Altcoin Season Amid Deviation Of Cyclical Lows \u2013 Details The analyst believes that altcoins would start \u201cshining\u201d when the next leg upwards for Ethereum takes place, possibly ushering in altcoin season.

However, for now, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes investors need to have some more patience.

That metric tracks Bitcoin per fully diluted share, so it puts the firm\u2019s strategy under a clear spotlight. Based on reports, the company gained 4,367 BTC valued at $451 million in this period, using prices from Bitflyer. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,111 $BTC, Total Holdings Reach 11,111 BTC* pic.twitter.com/7ceEeSh1X4 \u2014 Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Balance Sheet Swells to 11,111 BTC With the new purchase, Metaplanet\u2019s total stash now stands at 11,111 BTC, worth just over $1.07 billion. Its cost basis for those coins sits at about $95,869 each. Metaplanet\u2019s shares dipped 3.5% on the day of the announcement, a sign that investors may be worried about how the firm is funding its buy-ups. Source: Metaplanet Funding Through Bonds And Shares Based on reports, the company has raised cash via zero-coupon bonds and equity rights since January. It issued over 210 million shares under a program it calls the \u201c210 Million Plan.\u201d Evo Fund has snapped up many of those bonds and rights. Between May and June 2025, Metaplanet pulled in over $300 million, earmarking every dollar for more Bitcoin. Ambitious Target Of 210,000 BTC Metaplanet has set a goal to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That is 10 times its current pile. To reach that number, it will need to keep tapping the capital markets\u2014and it plans to. The firm even created a dedicated Bitcoin Treasury Operations arm in December 2024, moving away from its hotel management roots. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Dilution And Risk For Shareholders Metaplanet\u2019s fully diluted share count rose to close to 760 million as of June 23. That puts its Bitcoin per 1,000 shares at 0.0146 BTC. More bonds and shares mean more dilution for existing investors. If Bitcoin\u2019s price slips, the cost of raising money could climb, eating into any gains from the crypto itself. Metaplanet\u2019s approach mirrors what some other big holders have done. It\u2019s a bold stance. If Bitcoin holds up or heads higher, the firm could see big returns. But it will need to balance fresh capital raises against the risk of pushing down its own stock. For now, Metaplanet shows no sign of slowing down its Bitcoin buying. The only real question is how far this strategy can run before the bills come due.
