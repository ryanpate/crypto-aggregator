      "summary": "Bitcoin continues to consolidate just below its all-time high of $112K, holding firmly above key support at $105K despite repeated bearish attempts to push the price lower. This tight trading range reflects market uncertainty, yet the structure favors bulls as long as support levels remain intact. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support \u2013 Momentum Builds For Range Breakout Meanwhile, macroeconomic conditions are evolving rapidly. The US Congress recently passed President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d economic package ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline, signaling a new phase of fiscal stimulus marked by tax cuts and aggressive spending. Combined with strong job reports, these factors suggest inflation may soon accelerate \u2014 a trend that historically supports Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat devaluation. On the market sentiment side, funding rates provide a crucial clue. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the 30-day average of Bitcoin perpetual funding rates is currently very low. This reflects a lack of excessive greed and typically marks a favorable setup for bullish continuation. Historically, periods of low funding rates have preceded major upward moves, especially when paired with strong macro tailwinds. With economic pressure building and Bitcoin still in a bullish structure, the coming days could define the next major move for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. Calm Before The Breakout: Bitcoin Gains Strength Above $107K Bitcoin is up more than 3% since the start of July, holding firmly above the $107,000 local low despite repeated resistance at the $110,000 level. This sustained strength signals underlying buyer support and growing momentum as BTC continues to consolidate just below all-time highs. The $110K resistance remains a critical ceiling \u2014 once breached, analysts expect a strong move into price discovery as bullish momentum builds. So far, the market has digested a wave of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Global trade dynamics \u2014 including rising tariffs, export restrictions, and deglobalization trends \u2014 continue to shape sentiment. Yet, compared to the sharp volatility seen earlier this year, both Bitcoin and US equities appear more resilient. This suggests that much of the uncertainty has already been priced in, reducing the downside risk for risk assets like BTC. A key technical factor reinforcing the bullish case is the low 30-day average of funding rates. This indicator reflects a neutral-to-cautiously optimistic market environment \u2014 a stark contrast to overheated bullish phases that often precede corrections. Calm periods like this often set the stage for explosive moves, particularly when supply squeezes and strong demand meet a macro environment ripe for risk-taking. With BTC coiling tightly and sentiment balanced, a breakout could be imminent. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise BTC Holds Steady as Bulls Eye $109,300 Breakout The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin (BTC) consolidating within a tight range, holding above the key support at $107,000 and testing resistance around $109,300. This price level has consistently acted as a local ceiling, with several failed breakout attempts in late June and early July. However, the bulls continue to defend higher lows, signaling strength and setting the stage for a potential breakout. The 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) are stacked close together and gradually trending upward, suggesting the consolidation phase could soon transition into a more directional move. Volume remains low, which often precedes a volatility spike, especially near key resistance levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical The $103,600 support remains the crucial line in the sand for bulls. A breakdown below that level would invalidate the short-term bullish structure and likely lead to a deeper retrace.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has been showing notable correlation to the stock equities recently, but data shows Ethereum is charting a more independent path. Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Showing Different Degrees Of Correlation To Other Assets In a post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) has talked about how the latest Correlation Matrix has looked between the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and traditional markets. The &#8220;Correlation Matrix&#8221; here refers to an indicator that tells us how closely tied together the prices of two given assets currently are. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the assets are reacting to moves in each other by moving in the same direction to some degree. The closer the metric is to 1, the stronger the relationship. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies there is a negative correlation between the two prices. That is, they are moving in opposite directions. For this side of the scale, the extreme point is -1. Naturally, the Correlation Matrix showing a value exactly equal to zero suggests there is no correlation whatsoever between the assets. In statistics, the two variables are said to be &#8216;independent&#8217; in this case. Now, here is the table shared by Sentora that shows how the Correlation Matrix of Bitcoin and Ethereum stands with respect to some traditional markets: As is visible above, the index that Bitcoin and Ethereum have the strongest positive correlation to is DAX. That said, the Correlation Matrix stands at 0.46 for ETH, meaning that while some correlation does exist, it&#8217;s not too intense. This isn&#8217;t the case for Bitcoin, which has the indicator sitting at 0.85, indicating its price is pretty in tandem with DAX. Likewise, BTC has a notable correlation to other stock market indices, with a metric value of 0.7, 0.68, and 0.69 for the Russel 2000, S&#38;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively. In contrast, Ethereum is almost fully independent from these indices, with the indicator standing quite close to zero for each of them. For US Dollar Index and VIX Index, the last two markets listed in the table, the Correlation Matrix is inside the negative zone for Bitcoin. This means that the digital asset has actively been moving against these indices.

Just like with the stocks, Ethereum is displaying little correlation to DXY and VIX, further reinforcing that the cryptocurrency has been following a trajectory of its own recently. BTC Price Bitcoin is mounting another bullish push as its price surges to $109,400, but it remains to be seen whether its fate will be any different from the weekend move.

      "summary": "On Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a remarkable all-time high (ATH) of $112,022, breaking free from its previous consolidation phase and lower resistance levels. Bitcoin Rally Faces Critical Test John Glover, the chief investment officer at crypto lending platform Ledn and a former managing director at Barclays Investment Bank, noted that the recent rally appears to be a retest of the previous all-time high set on May 22, which encountered selling pressure. As some investors opted to take profits, notable publicly traded companies, including Trump Media &#38; Technology Group and GameStop, have announced their intentions to purchase Bitcoin to bolster their treasuries. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% \u201cMoonshot\u201d For XRP Price If This Line Breaks Glover emphasized that the competition among these companies to accumulate Bitcoin could significantly impact market dynamics, given that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s popularity among publicly traded companies appears to be growing. However, the sustainability of Bitcoin&#8217;s rally largely hinges on macroeconomic conditions and developments in trade negotiations. Sid Powell, CEO of crypto asset-management firm Maple, highlighted that any setbacks in trade discussions before President Donald Trump\u2019s August 1 deadline could pose challenges for Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement. Conversely, if trade negotiations progress and inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve (Fed) might consider cutting interest rates, which could further support Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory. Scenarios For A Potential Breakout Toward $130,000 Market expert Doctor Profit recently took to social media, declaring that Bitcoin&#8217;s rally is just beginning. He confidently stated, &#8220;THE PARTY IS NOT OVER YET,&#8221; predicting a potential new all-time high soon. His analysis indicates a target range of $120,000 to $130,000 for this cycle. According to Doctor Profit, two potential scenarios could pave the way for this breakout. The first involves Bitcoin reaching the $113,000 to $114,000 range, followed by a correction to the $92,000 to $93,000 level, which aligns with a major liquidity pool and the CME gap. A rebound from this lower range could set the stage for a rapid ascent toward the $120,000 mark. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP\u2019s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated The second, more aggressive scenario suggests that Bitcoin could break through the $113,000 to $114,000 barrier and continue its upward momentum without revisiting lower liquidity levels. In either case, the $113,000 to $114,000 range is critical, as the market&#8217;s reaction to this level will significantly influence the speed and direction of Bitcoin&#8217;s next leg. When writing, BTC has retraced back toward $111,422, attempting to make this level its new support floor for further price appreciation. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"
