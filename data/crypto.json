      "summary": "Despite failing to break out of its downtrend, ONDO could be preparing for a surge above the $2 barrier. Some analysts suggest it could repeat its 2024 playbook if it continues to hold its current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim \u2013 \u2018Up Only\u2019 Ahead? ONDO Breakout Eyes $2 ONDO, the native token of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance, is attempting to reclaim a key area amid the market pullback. Notably, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold the $1 mark since losing the area as support over three months ago. In December, the RWA token hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.14 after US President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), purchased 134,216 ONDO tokens for 250,000 USDC. This propelled ONDO\u2019s price above the $2 barrier for the first time, but the late 2024 and Q1 2025 corrections halted its bullish momentum, sending its price to the $0.60-$0.70 range. Following the late April market recovery, ONDO\u2019s price reclaimed the $0.85 area and broke out of its multi-month downtrend. The cryptocurrency then hovered between the $0.85-$1.10 levels throughout May, hitting a three-month high of $1.13 nearly a month ago. Since then, the token has been in a one-month downtrend, dipping below its local range after the recent market pullback. However, the cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim this range for the past week, hitting a one-week high of $0.92 on Wednesday. Crypto analyst World of Charts highlighted the token\u2019s performance, affirming, \u201cafter a long correction, Finally Looking Good For Midterm.\u201d As ONDO attempts to reclaim the $0.90 area, the analyst anticipates that the cryptocurrency will soon break out of its current range and the downtrend line, forecasting a 130% rally toward the $2 barrier. 2024 ATH Repeat Coming? On Thursday, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted ONDO\u2019s performance over the past year, asserting, \u201cNot sure there are many other charts looking as good on high time frames like ONDO.\u201d He explained that \u201cThe King of RWA\u201d is \u201cbasically holding a bullish structure since its launch,\u201d making a series of higher lows for over a year while maintaining its ascending support trendline. Meanwhile, analyst Alex Clay suggested that ONDO could see a parabolic run based on its performance in 2024. The market watcher noted that the token is currently accumulating at the bottom of a 15-month ascending channel, which previously served as a crucial bounce point for its rally toward its ATH. As Clay explained, after reaching the channel\u2019s upper boundary last year, ONDO saw a multi-month downtrend toward the lower boundary, before printing a higher low. This was followed by a massive rally toward the channel\u2019s top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback This year, ONDO is \u201cfollowing the Bullish Fractal from the previous year\u201d after falling to the channel\u2019s lower boundary, breaking out of the downtrend line, and registering a higher low. \u201cThese 2 reasons are more than enough to pump straight up to the channel&#8217;s top,\u201d the analyst concluded. If history repeats, the cryptocurrency could surge toward the $2.8-$3 area. At the time of writing, ONDO trades at $0.84, a 5.2% decline in the daily timeframe.

Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price Alert, Key Levels To Watch According to top crypto analyst Daan Crypto, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a narrow window after losing the range high located at $108,385. While the cryptocurrency has been able to withstand the sell-off, the analyst drew important levels to watch. As seen on the chart below, and according to the analyst, the Bitcoin price is likely to stay on its bearish course and potentially touch the mid area of its current range. This price action would put BTC at around $99,600 in the coming days. If buyers can\u2019t hold the sell pressure around this level, then BTC is more than likely to keep bleeding into its range low of $90,000. This bearish price action, the analyst clarified, would become the norm for the rest of June. Key Levels to watch as the Bitcoin price shows weakness on low timeframes. Source: Daan Crypto via X Daan Crypto stated the following regarding the Bitcoin price action: Quick move after that which was obviously &#8220;helped&#8221; by the headlines although the news was looming already with the past 48 hours of headlines which is also why price started selling of prior. I&#8217;ve said it a couple of times before but I&#8217;ll say it again. Bulls had no business going back down below $108K and I&#8217;m treating this as another deviation and move back into the larger range. This is reason enough for me to be cautious and not add on exposure that was derisked (\u2026). In this context, the analyst advised his followers to wait for clear confirmation that the bull trend is returning if Bitcoin can retake its range high around the previously mentioned level. Otherwise, the best course of action is to remain cautious. Optimism Fades as Bitcoin Aims for Lower On a separate note, trading desk QCP Group noted that the biggest risk for Bitcoin and the crypto market comes from the rising tensions between the US and China, and the growing tensions in the Middle East.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows Ethereum has just witnessed its largest daily withdrawal in over a month, a sign that may turn out to be bullish for the asset&#8217;s price. Ethereum Has Recently Seen Notable Exchange Outflows As explained by the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) in a new post on X, a large amount of Ethereum has left exchanges. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the &#8220;Exchange Netflow,&#8221; which measures the net amount of ETH entering into or exiting out of the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchanges are receiving a net number of deposits. As one of the main reasons why investors deposit their tokens to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish implication for the ETH price. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals On the other hand, the indicator being below zero suggests the exchange outflows outweigh the inflows. Such a trend can imply the holders are accumulating, which can naturally have a bullish effect on the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Sentora that shows the trend in the Ethereum Exchange Netflow over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Exchange Netflow has seen a sharp negative spike during the past day, which suggests the investors have withdrawn a significant amount of the cryptocurrency. In total, the exchanges have handled net outflows of more than 140,000 ETH (worth about $390 million) with this withdrawal spree. This is the largest single-day exit that these platforms have faced in over a month. These outflows have come as Ethereum has been attempting a breakout from its month-long range. As such, it&#8217;s possible that a portion of the large holders of the market have some level of confidence in this rally. In some other news, the cash-margined Ethereum Futures Open Interest has set a new all-time high, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in an X post. The Futures Open Interest is an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to Ethereum that are currently open on all derivatives platforms. Here, the &#8216;cash-margined&#8217; Open Interest is of relevance, which includes all the contracts that have fiat/stablecoins as collateral.

It comes in below art, cars and collectibles, which together amount to $27 trillion. Gold, long a trusted store of value, sits at $22 trillion. So, while Bitcoin is rare by design, it still trails behind assets with centuries of history and deep pockets on the buying side. Scarcity Fuels Price Talk With only 21 million coins ever to be mined, Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap is fixed. That has led to forecasts of big price jumps if demand keeps growing. Based on reports, some say Bitcoin could match gold\u2019s $22 trillion market cap one day. That would push a single coin past $1.15 million. Other backers warn that missing out now could mean buying in later at much higher levels, driven by FOMO\u2014fear of missing out.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s blistering second-quarter advance is tracking the strongest expansion in global liquidity on record, according to Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts, who argues that every additional percentage point of liquidity injected into the financial system \u201cshould\u201d translate into a 20% gain for the cryptocurrency. 1% Liquidity = 20% Bitcoin? Writing on X, Coutts observed that his proprietary Global Liquidity Index broke to a fresh all-time high on 10 April after three years of drift and that, in the nine weeks since, Bitcoin has rallied about 40 percent. &#8220;Bitcoin has rallied 40% since April 10 which was when my global liquidity aggregate (GLI) after 3 years broke out to new all time highs on the back of a plummeting US dollar. Since then the aggregate is up 2%. Bitcoin&#8217;s Q2 rally is entirely consistent with liquidity regimes of this nature.&#8221; He added that &#8220;while Bitcoin\u2019s sensitivity to GLI moderates over time, for every extra 1 percent of liquidity added to the system we should expect to see a &#62; 20 percent move in the price of Bitcoin,\u201d he said, further claiming that the steady inflow of capital \u201cdoesn\u2019t account for the inevitable \u2018oh shit\u2019 moment of panic buying that is going to happen\u2026 eventually. It will be best of times, it will be the worst of times.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet\u2014But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos The chart he shared, reproduced above, overlays his GLI (white) with daily Bitcoin prices (orange) from 2018 through June 2025. It shows the index pressing to roughly $138 trillion while Bitcoin changes hands near $108,000, underscoring the tight directional relationship between the two series across several liquidity cycles. Coutts builds the indicator by combining G4 central-bank balance sheets, broad money aggregates such as M2, and key US liquidity accounts including the Treasury General Account and the Federal Reserve\u2019s reverse-repo facility. Since the April breakout the GLI has added only about two percentage points, yet Bitcoin\u2019s market value has already risen by twice the elasticity implied by his model\u2014an outcome he considers \u201centirely consistent\u201d with prior liquidity regimes, which tend to produce the sharpest price response early in the cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: \u2018Fair Price\u2019 Today Is $230,000 For now, he sees little evidence that the GLI\u2019s momentum is cresting; with the Federal Reserve still draining its reverse-repo facility, the People\u2019s Bank of China quietly expanding its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank hinting at renewed long-term refinancing operations, the backdrop remains structurally bullish even if it won\u2019t be a straight line. Looking further out, mainstream liquidity research suggests modest but persistent growth: most macro desks expect the global aggregate to rise roughly one to six percent over the next twelve months, three to eight percent cumulatively by mid-2027, and on the order of ten to fifteen percent by the turn of the decade as governments roll over record debt loads and central banks normalise balance-sheet policies. If Coutts\u2019 rule of thumb holds, even the low end of those projections would leave ample headroom for triple-digit percentage gains in Bitcoin before 2030. At press time, BTC traded at $107,676.
