      "summary": "Despite the recent rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,900, crypto analysts have warned that the Bitcoin price could still witness a massive crash that will send it below $100,000. These analysts highlighted fundamentals and technicals that could spark this price crash. Analysts Highlight Why Bitcoin Price Could Still Crash Below $100,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Stephan mentioned the geopolitical tensions, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifying as one of the factors that could spark the Bitcoin price crash. He explained how this conflict could drive investors toward safe-haven assets, such as gold. The analyst also noted that Bitcoin ETFs experienced modest outflows last week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $104,000: What You Need To Know In June Stephan\u2019s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could drop to as low as $96,765 as it retests the psychological $100,000 support level. Crypto analyst Nova also warned that Bitcoin could drop to $100,000 while providing a technical analysis of the flagship crypto\u2019s current price action. In a TradingView post, Nova stated that if the Bitcoin price faces resistance around the $106,406 daily level and continues to correct, it could extend the decline to retest the psychologically important $100,000 mark. She further revealed that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is at 53, trending downwards to the neutral level of 50. This indicates weakening bullish momentum. Nova also stated that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed a bearish crossover last week. Meanwhile, the analyst alluded to the increasing red histogram bars below the baseline, which she claimed further signal a potential correction ahead. Her accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could drop to $99,000 as it retests the $100,000 level. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also called for caution at the current Bitcoin price level. He stated that nothing has changed for the flagship crypto and indicated that there was no need to be ultra bullish at this current level. The analyst earlier warned that things could get sketchy looking for BTC if it fails to reclaim $106,800 soon enough. BTC Could Still Rally To $135,000 This Year In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price rallying to $135,000 this year. He noted that BTC has broken out of a right-angled descending broadening wedge, and if the price holds above the breakout zone, $135,000 becomes a realistic target. The analyst added that the structure is clean. Related Reading: Head And Shoulders Pattern Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Down Toward $95,000 Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that the Bitcoin price is gearing up for a new all-time high. He further remarked that $120,000 remains a magnet for the flagship crypto in this market cycle. Meanwhile, veteran trader Peter Brandt predicted that BTC could reach $150,000 by late summer 2025. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,400, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the retail interest in Bitcoin has been waning as small-holder volume has gone down during the past month. Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand Has Seen A Negative 30-Day Change In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the &#8220;Retail Investor Demand&#8221; of Bitcoin. This indicator provides an estimate for, as its name suggests, the amount of demand that the smallest of investors, the &#8216;retail,&#8217; have toward the cryptocurrency right now. The metric does so by referring to the transaction volume associated with this cohort. Considering the small wallet size attached to these holders, their transfers would typically remain under a value of $10,000, so the volume related to them can be separated from the rest of the market by only restricting to transfers below this size. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3\u20135 Year Holders Slow Selloff\u2014Waiting for Higher Prices? Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the 30-day percentage change in the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand saw its 30-day change enter into the positive territory when the latest bull rally first started, suggesting that the small investors increased their transfer activity. The 30-day change continued a gradual rise as the run played out, but after the cryptocurrency set its new all-time high (ATH), it noted a reversal in direction. Today, the metric has declined enough to dip back into the negative territory, meaning that retail investor volume is now going down on the monthly timeframe. From the chart, it&#8217;s also apparent that even at its peak, the 30-day change in the Retail Investor Demand never actually touched a high level this rally, which is in sharp contrast to the run from the end of 2024. Thus, it would appear that the recent price surge not only failed to ignite any notable level of interest among the small hands but also failed to maintain the attention that it did gather. The switch to a negative monthly change for the Retail Investor Demand could be down to the bearish action that the coin&#8217;s price has seen since the ATH, but the fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is currently still very much in range of this record, so it&#8217;s interesting to see this sentiment among the group. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go \u2018Bananas\u2019 If Price Closes Above This Level, Top Analyst Says Speaking of transaction volume, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the volume share of the Bitcoin miners.

This implies these chain validators have seen their activity plummet relative to the rest of the network.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-to-21-this-bull-cycle/",
      "summary": "According to expert analysts, the XRP price is showing renewed bullish momentum, with projections suggesting a potential rally to the 1.618 Fib at $21 this bull cycle. While this projection may seem ambitious, the analyst\u2019s bullish outlook doesn\u2019t stop there. Once XRP hits $21, it is expected to continue its upward trajectory toward its next target of $152. XRP Price Eyes Powerful Breakout To New Targets A recent technical analysis of XRP\u2019s long-term price chart is igniting significant buzz in the crypto community, as the altcoin appears to be forming a familiar pattern that previously led to exponential gains. The chart, published by a well-known crypto expert, Javon Marks, suggests that XRP could be on the brink of a powerful price breakout, with expectations pointing toward the $21 price level and beyond. Related Reading: Wave Structure Puts XRP Price In The $18.22-$23.20 Range In The Short Term Marks\u2019 analysis identifies two major symmetrical triangle formations in XRP\u2019s price history\u2014one that preceded its explosive rally in 2017 and another that concluded with a fresh breakout in 2024. In the earlier cycle, XRP surged thousands of percent after breaking out of its consolidation pattern, topping near the 2.272 Fibonacci level. This historical price movement is now being used to forecast what could come next for the altcoin. According to the chart, XRP recently rose to the 1.0 Fibonacci level near $3.31 but retraced back toward $2. If the current cycle mirrors the previous one, Marks predicts that the next significant level of interest lies at the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level, which aligns with the $21 price target. Notably, a surge to this double-digit territory would represent an over 800% increase from current levels around $2.23. However, Marks\u2019 optimistic projection does not stop there. Should XRP replicate the full extension it made in the past, the price is forecasted to reach the 2.272 Fibonacci level once again, this time sitting around a jaw-dropping $152. While this forecast may seem over the top, the analyst has shown strong confidence in XRP\u2019s future price outlook, utilizing past price action as a blueprint and technical indicator to determine the altcoin\u2019s upside potential. Analyst\u2019s XRP Forecast Met With Skepticism On one hand, Marks\u2019 bullish XRP price forecast was met with excitement, and on the other, the majority of crypto community members expressed doubts about the overly ambitious targets. The projection of a move to $21 and possibly even higher to $152 has been met with caution and skepticism among community members. Related Reading: Bullish Candle Formation Suggests The XRP Price Could Touch $22 While historical patterns can provide a roadmap to a potential price rally, critics responding to Marks\u2019 analysis argue that reaching the triple-digit territory is virtually impossible for XRP currently. One member suggested that a more realistic target for the altcoin was between $13 and $20. Others questioned the feasibility of hitting these bullish targets within the proposed timeline, debating whether it could happen by the end of 2025 or even Q1 2026.

      "title": "Dogecoin Caught In Compression: Descending Triangle Warns Of Potential Collapse",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-in-descending-triangle/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is teetering on a critical edge as price action tightens within a descending triangle pattern, hinting at rising bearish pressure. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has entered a phase of low volatility and narrowing price movement, a classic sign of market indecision that often precedes a significant breakout or breakdown. With the 200-period moving average applying dynamic resistance from above and horizontal support showing signs of strain, DOGE&#8217;s technical landscape suggests a potential collapse could be on the horizon if buyers fail to defend key levels. Price Coils Within Bearish Formation Ahead Of Potential Breakout Market analyst Thomas Anderson, in a recent post on X, pointed out that \u201cDOGE is consolidating within a descending triangle pattern on the M30 timeframe,\u201d signaling a period of indecision. This chart pattern, often seen in bearish continuations, is characterized by a flat support base with lower highs pressing from above. As Dogecoin trades deeper into this structure, the probability of a breakout, either upward or downward, is increasing with each narrowing move. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree Anderson further explained that DOGE is \u201ccurrently testing the upper resistance around $0.19998,\u201d a key level that has capped recent bullish attempts. This resistance aligns with the descending trendline of the triangle and is strengthened by the 200 MA (red line), acting as dynamic resistance. The presence of the 200-period moving average at this level adds extra weight to the upper line, making any potential breakout attempt more challenging for the bulls in the near term. Until price action breaks decisively in either direction, DOGE remains locked in a tightening range. For now, Anderson\u2019s observations underline the importance of this technical structure, as DOGE nears a critical inflection point. Triangle Compression Builds Tension For Dogecoin The analyst further emphasized that momentum appears to be weakening as Dogecoin\u2019s price action tightens near the apex of the descending triangle. According to the expert\u2019s observations, the 1-hour chart reinforces this broader consolidation phase, showing a clear compression of price within the pattern. This type of setup often leads to an explosive move once the market chooses a direction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 A confirmed breakout above the $0.19998 resistance could pave the way for a short-term bullish run, with higher targets potentially opening up if volume supports the move, potentially invalidating the bearish triangle pattern. However, failure to breach this resistance level may reinforce the bearish structure, increasing the likelihood of a pullback toward the lower triangle support around $0.19010, a critical area where buyers previously stepped in.
