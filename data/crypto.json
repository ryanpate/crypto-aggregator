      "summary": "Bitcoin continues to trade below its recent all-time high as selling pressure and macroeconomic developments keep the asset in consolidation. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $104,835, down 2.1% over the past week and around 6.3% off from its peak of $111,814 recorded last month. Despite the broader trend, on-chain data reveals emerging patterns that may signal what could come next in the market. Following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting, analysts have noted diverging trends in Bitcoin\u2019s price and derivatives market activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Momentum Wobbles\u2014Analyst Predicts Correction Below $94K Derivatives Deleveraging and Liquidation Clusters Shape Price Structure According to Amr Taha, a contributor on CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake platform, BTC has been hovering above the $104,000 support zone, where strong demand appears to be absorbing sell pressure. However, Taha pointed out that open interest on Binance has declined, forming lower lows, a sign that the derivatives market is undergoing progressive deleveraging. Taha\u2019s analysis emphasized a technical divergence: while price has remained relatively stable around the $104,000 level, open interest has been falling. This divergence suggests that traders are reducing leveraged positions, possibly due to market uncertainty or as a response to the Fed\u2019s cautious stance. Notably, the $104K region has emerged as a critical liquidity pocket, with data showing long positions being liquidated massively in this area. The dominance of long-side liquidations, with few short liquidations, reflects a flush-out of recent entrants attempting to ride the previous rally. The analyst argued that this deleveraging phase could pave the way for a price rebound if macro conditions remain favorable. Historically, Bitcoin has responded positively to rate pauses, often resuming upward movement when signs of seller exhaustion appear. The stabilization of open interest, combined with reduced liquidations, might act as a foundation for a new upward push in the near term. Bitcoin Whale Activity on Binance and Shifts in Market Behavior In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Oinonen, highlighted growing whale activity on Binance. Since 2023, the whale ratio metric on the exchange has surged dramatically, climbing from 0.08 in mid-2023 to as high as 0.77 in 2025. This shift marks a 400% increase and indicates significant accumulation behavior among large holders. Whale inflows and retention on Binance have generally coincided with longer-term confidence during periods of market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Channel Break Below $105,000 Sparks Panic, Analysts Predict Further Crashes Moreover, the data shows that during recent episodes of elevated volatility, Binance users have leaned toward holding rather than exiting positions. Inflows to the platform have remained low, particularly from both whales and retail participants, suggesting that market participants are refraining from panic selling and instead are anticipating future price appreciation.

      "title": "Dogecoin Shows Signs Of Life With Bottoming Signal",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-signs-of-life-bottom-signal/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s daily chart, published by the pseudonymous trader Cantonese Cat on X Wednesday, hints that the meme-coin may be stirring after a months-long down-draft. At 02:26 UTC the TradingView snapshot captured DOGE changing hands at $0.16979, fractionally lower on the session, while the 14-period relative-strength index sat at 35.72, just north of classical oversold territory. Dogecoin Prints Bullish Divergence The most striking feature of the graphic is a sequence of regular bullish divergences\u2014price sets progressively lower lows even as the RSI traces higher troughs. Cantonese Cat illustrates three such inflection points: the first in August 2024, the second in March and April 2025 and the latest in mid-June. Historically, the first signal preceded the parabolic autumn rally that vaulted DOGE from the high-$0.05 area to an intraday peak just shy of $0.23, a nearly 300% advance. The March divergence ushered in a 100 percent rebound back to the $0.26 zone, a former support now acting as overhead resistance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Looks Like \u2018It Wants To Play Dead\u2019\u2014Again \u201cDOGE daily \u2013 Bullish divergence with RSI,\u201d Cantonese Cat wrote in his post, letting the annotated arrows speak louder than prose. A schematic inserted on the right-hand side of the chart underlines the textbook definition: in the highlighted quadrant, price slopes downward while momentum slopes upward, a configuration often interpreted as buyers quietly absorbing supply. Descending Channel And Key Support Line The current structural context lends weight to the signal. Since topping out in November above $0.48, price is retracing inside a descending channel. Within that broader channel, Dogecoin is now retesting a former down-sloping resistance line\u2014which provided stiff resistance throughout March and April this year\u2014that it finally broke in early May and is now acting as crucial support near $0.163. Just below this back-test sits the multi-year ascending trendline which now sits close to $0.142. Should both of those levels falter, the true lower boundary of the descending channel waits a fraction lower around $0.139, giving bulls only a narrow buffer of roughly three cents to defend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Enters \u2018Alarm Zone,\u2019 Major Move Coming? From a Fibonacci perspective, the 0.786 retracement at $0.1826\u2014coupled with the 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages as well as the channel midline at $0.172\u2014forms the first ceiling that must be cleared to shift near-term momentum. A breakout above that area would expose the 0.618 level at $0.247 and the 100-day EMA. Successive hurdles then stack at the 0.5 retracement ($0.292), the 0.382 ($0.338), and the 0.236 ($0.3939), each corresponding to prior congestion zones during the winter advance. Volume has begun to taper as price approaches support, while the 14-period RSI remains anchored in the mid-30s\u2014still technically oversold, but showing a slight uptick that mirrors the bullish divergence Cantonese Cat flagged. For bears, a decisive daily close beneath the multi-year trendline would invalidate that divergence setup and likely drive DOGE toward the horizontal liquidity band between $0.135 and $0.13, with a final capitulation target around $0.10\u2014site of last October\u2019s base.

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent pullback has sparked fresh debate over whether the rally has run its course. According to market watcher Titan of Crypto, the story isn\u2019t over yet. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Bitcoin slipped just 6% from its all\u2011time high of $112,000, but some analysts pointed to a cooling relative strength index (RSI) and warned of a top. Titan\u2019s take flips that view on its head, arguing that we\u2019re still deep in the meat of the bull cycle. Fractal Cycles Keep Running Titan pointed to a clear pattern in Bitcoin\u2019s last two cycles. Each cycle began with roughly 13 monthly bars\u2014about 396 days\u2014of steep decline. In 2014\u201315, Bitcoin fell from $1,240 to $161 over that span. Prices then rallied for 35 bars (1,065 days) to hit $19,800 in December 2017. The same 13\u2011bar slide followed by 35 bars of gains played out again after 2018, ending at $69,000 in 2021. #Bitcoin Bull Market Entering Final Phase \ud83c\udfc1 As in previous cycles: ~1 year of bear market, followed by ~3 years of expansion.$BTC looks to be in the final leg but not done yet. pic.twitter.com/MGre5ahz3P \u2014 Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) June 18, 2025 Momentum And RSI In Focus Some analysts flagged a weakening RSI as a sign that Bitcoin has peaked. That metric can\u2019t be ignored\u2014when momentum wanes, price often takes a breather. Titan\u2019s chart lays down the time\u2011based pattern, but RSI, trading volume, and on\u2011chain data give a live read on demand. Bull Run Still Has Room Based on reports, the current cycle\u2019s bullish phase kicked off in January 2023 and sits in the 29th bar this month. Bitcoin has climbed 530% since the start of that run. If history holds, we\u2019ve got at least five more monthly bars of uptrend before the rally tops out around November. Earlier studies even point to a wedge breakout that could send price to about $137,000 before any serious pullback. Big Names See Higher Peaks Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, foresees Bitcoin tearing past the $1 million mark in a fierce upswing, powered by government rollouts, sovereign bond issuances, and an urgent surge in &#8216;hyperbitcoinization&#8217; before seeing any real correction. Raoul Pal (Real Vision), the former Goldman Sachs executive, shares a familiar bullish view. He has laid out scenarios where Bitcoin hits $1 million by 2030, based on monetary stimulus and limited supply. Related Reading: Iran\u2019s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links\u2014Details Strategy&#8217;s Michael Saylor has also said Bitcoin could skyrocket to between $500,000 and $1 million before seeing any real correction. These big names in the crypto industry highlight growing institutional inflows and a looming supply squeeze after the next halving as fuel for an even higher peak. This rally isn\u2019t just a rerun of what we saw in 2017 or 2021. Bitcoin today moves with ETFs, big\u2011ticket corporate buys, and more traders watching on\u2011chain signals than ever before. Meanwhile, the latest outlook by CoinCodex sees Bitcoin climbing 5.73% to hit roughly $110,732 by July 19, 2025. Right now, technical signals point to a Neutral mood, while the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 57\u2014squarely in Greed territory. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"
