ADA price started a fresh decline below $0.5820 and $0.5750. The price is trading above $0.560 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5640 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it dips below the $0.5560 support zone. Cardano Price Fails To Extend Gains In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.590 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA declined below the $0.580 level and trimmed most gains. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5567 swing low to the $0.5902 high. The price even spiked below the $0.570 support but stayed above $0.5650. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5640 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5567 swing low to the $0.5902 high. Cardano price is now trading above $0.5650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5735 zone. The first resistance is near $0.5820. The next key resistance might be $0.590. If there is a close above the $0.590 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.620 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.6350 in the near term. More Losses In ADA? If Cardano\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.5820 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.5640 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.5460 level. A downside break below the $0.5460 level could open the doors for a test of $0.5250. The next major support is near the $0.510 level where the bulls might emerge.

      "summary": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded slight gains over the past month &#8211; up 3.6% in the last 30 days &#8211; the leading cryptocurrency is experiencing a lack of Apparent Demand, indicating broader market weakness that could lead to a price slump in the near term. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Enters Negative Territory According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin\u2019s new buyer demand is failing to absorb the combined supply pressure from freshly mined BTC and selling from long-term holders (LTHs). As a result, BTC\u2019s Apparent Demand has turned negative. The analyst noted that the imbalance between buyer demand and excessive supply has created a high-risk environment for a near-term price correction. Notably, the $100,000 level remains an important support for the flagship digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weak Hands Exit While Smart Money Loads Up \u2013 Is A Breakout Near? For the uninitiated, Bitcoin\u2019s Apparent Demand measures the balance between new buying interest and the supply of coins entering the market from miners and LTHs selling. When this metric turns negative, it means that the amount of BTC being sold exceeds new purchases, indicating potential market weakness and downward price pressure. BTC entering negative Apparent Demand territory can be considered a bearish development for two key reasons. First, it directly increases the \u201cfor sale\u201d BTC supply, exerting downward pressure on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Second, significant selling by LTHs &#8211; often considered seasoned and sophisticated investors &#8211; suggests that experienced players believe the crypto market has likely reached a local top and are exiting before a potential severe market downturn. The analyst added: Consequently, the market is in a vulnerable state. Any price rallies from here will likely struggle to overcome this wave of available supply, and market support may be weaker than anticipated. While not a guarantee, this on-chain signal strongly suggests a period of caution is warranted until demand shows clear signs of recovery. That said, recent on-chain analysis indicates a more optimistic outlook. According to fellow CryptoQuant analyst Avocado_onchain, the 30-day moving average (MA) of Bitcoin Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) shows signs of healthy consolidation rather than a potential local top. Some Positive Signs For BTC While BTC\u2019s Apparent Demand might be drying up, easing global geopolitical tensions could catalyze a rally in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Further positive macroeconomic developments may also benefit BTC, potentially leading to a cycle top much higher than currently anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K\u2013$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest Another indicator negating the possibility of a major price pullback is the steadily rising short-term holder (STH) floor price, which has surged to as high as $98,000 according to the latest on-chain data.

      "summary": "Bitcoin and Ethereum both posted modest gains in the past week, with BTC rising 6.2% and ETH up by 9.6%. However, momentum appears to have paused at the start of the new week. As of Monday, Bitcoin trades just above $107,000 after a slight 0.6% daily dip, while Ethereum has remained flat over the past 24 hours. Analysts have turned to blockchain data and macro signals for cues on where the market may head next. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freezes Over $100,000 As OG Whales \u2018Dump On Wall Street\u2019: Expert Bitcoin and Ethereum Onchain Trend Recent insights from CryptoQuant Quicktake platform contributor Amr Taha provide some context behind the price action. In a detailed post, Taha noted that Ethereum inflows to Binance have continued for five consecutive days, a trend that could suggest either rising sell pressure or repositioning by major players. At the same time, data from Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holder (STH) Net Position Realized Cap shows a notable reversal, increasing from negative $49 billion to over $5 billion. This pattern is typically associated with increased activity from retail investors, especially during periods of upward price movement. Taha noted: Historically, spikes in (STH) occur near potential market tops, as retail investors tend to FOMO into Bitcoin rallies. While this doesn&#8217;t necessarily signal a reversal, it has often preceded short-term corrections or periods of sideways consolidation. Bitcoin\u2019s steady climb in June, despite occasional pullbacks, appears to have encouraged smaller investors to re-enter the market. In the case of Ethereum, another CryptoQuant analyst, \u201ccrypto sunmoon,\u201d pointed to continued accumulation by long-term holders during last month\u2019s price consolidation. This suggests a different dynamic is at play on the Ethereum side, with more patient capital building positions amid ongoing price suppression. Long-term holder accumulation often indicates growing confidence in an asset\u2019s future, even if current market conditions appear lackluster. US Policy and Macro Risk Add Layers to Market Outlook Beyond market behavior, external factors may also shape crypto price action. Amr Taha highlighted recent political developments in the United States, particularly former President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a proposed Senate bill promising wide-reaching tax cuts. The bill, which excludes taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security income, could lead to an increase in consumer liquidity. If passed, this could impact investor appetite across both traditional and digital markets by temporarily boosting household spending power. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Are Taking Fresh Market Positions, But Are They Safe? However, not everybody is convinced of the bill\u2019s long-term implications. Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that the measure, if not accompanied by spending cuts, could expand the federal deficit and lead to economic instability over time. Large fiscal imbalances often have ripple effects on monetary policy, potentially affecting interest rates, inflation expectations, and risk sentiment, all of which can influence investor behavior in crypto markets. Taha concluded: Geopolitical disturbances can significantly impact investor sentiment. In response, investors might reconsider their positions in asset markets, possibly moving away from riskier assets and equities toward more stable options like bonds or safe-haven currencies.
