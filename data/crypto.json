There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $160 swing high to the $144 low. However, the bears were active near the $156 resistance.

      "summary": "Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and long-time XRP advocate, ignited fresh debate across the crypto community by outlining what he believes to be the transformative implications of Ripple\u2019s bid for a US banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account. The developments, which Ripple confirmed 2 July, would position the company at the epicenter of both crypto innovation and traditional financial infrastructure. According to Van Code, the impact of such regulatory approvals would go far beyond Ripple\u2019s current operations. \u201cWith Ripple announcing they are seeking a banking charter as well as a Fed master account, this means they will be the very first crypto bank,\u201d he posted via X. He detailed that the move could allow Ripple to hold reserves directly with the Federal Reserve, bypassing commercial banks, and operate as a full-service financial institution offering both fiat and crypto products. This would include the ability to provide FDIC-insured deposit accounts\u2014potentially even for certain crypto assets\u2014up to the $250,000 limit, and lend against crypto collateral such as XRP. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be nuts. And XRP is flying it all together,\u201d he wrote, calling the possible integration of insured crypto banking and core cross-border remittances a paradigm shift. \u201c2025 to 2026 will be marked in history as the era which the 100 year banking cartel began to crumble.\u201d Related Reading: Analyst: XRP Is Coiled For A Short Squeeze Rally A master account would allow Ripple to interact directly with the Fed&#8217;s payment rails, including Fedwire and FedNow, giving it full access to the US financial system as a settlement counterparty. Combined with its push into stablecoins through RLUSD and its remittance infrastructure RippleNet, such a regulatory leap could fully embed Ripple into both domestic and international payment flows. Impact On XRP Price In a follow-up post, Van Code did something he says he rarely does: offer a specific XRP price prediction. \u201cI usually don\u2019t predict XRP price but often get asked, so here it is FINALLY,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy opinion is $30\u2013$50. And this is no shill, I don\u2019t expect anyone to agree with me. I am not prophet or time traveller. But my investment in XRP is based on this opinion.\u201d While he didn\u2019t commit to a timeframe, he emphasized that such targets are not arbitrary, but grounded in a set of unfolding macro and market catalysts. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure\u2014Analyst Says \u2018Fireworks Ahead\u2019 Among those catalysts, Van Code cited potential XRP spot ETF approval and an estimated $20\u2013$50 billion in institutional capital inflows. He also pointed to a potential master account approval coupled with RippleNet capturing 20\u201330% of the $1 trillion cross-border payments market, and global adoption of XRP as a bridge asset for central bank digital currency (CBDC) corridors in over 50 countries. Van Code further noted the rising use case for Ripple\u2019s stablecoin RLUSD, arguing that demand for a Fed-backed digital dollar would reinforce XRP\u2019s utility as a bridge currency. He also floated the idea that XRP could be used in Saudi oil settlements, citing Ripple\u2019s confirmed 2024 collaboration with the Saudi central bank as a possible foundation for that evolution. His posts have struck a chord in the XRP community. \u201cPeople weighed in on XRP price&#8230; Lots of interesting opinions. But common across all is everyone expecting price to at least 5x. This is a great sign,\u201d he said. The idea that XRP could rise to $30\u2013$50 implies a market cap in the trillions, something skeptics will call out as unrealistic. But for XRP holders, especially those who see Ripple\u2019s regulatory path as a backdoor to institutional legitimacy, the confluence of a Fed master account, bank charter, ETF inflows, and global adoption isn\u2019t merely theoretical. It\u2019s a roadmap. At press time, XRP traded at $2.27. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "TRON\u2019s token TRX has barely budged despite a flurry of on\u2011chain action. Traders saw a 5% gain over the past week and a measly 0.50% uptick in the last 24 hours. But behind those mild price moves, there\u2019s a storm of activity that could shape how TRX fares in the days ahead. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies\u2019 Surprising H1 2025 Lead Surge In On\u2011Chain Activity According to data from Artemis, daily transaction counts shot up to over 9 million, up from 7.5 million the day before. That jump in numbers sent active addresses soaring. On\u2011chain participants climbed to 2.7 million, marking the highest level since June 6. Based on reports, much of this traffic appears tied to stablecoin transfers rather than new users or fresh investment. The spike in transaction volume doesn\u2019t match TRX\u2019s price action. That gap hints at wallets moving funds out of exchanges, routing payments, or chasing yield elsewhere. Users aren\u2019t rushing to hold TRX for its own sake. They\u2019re using the network as a highway and then driving off into other chains. TRX market cap currently at $26.8 billion. Chart: TradingView Stablecoin Outflows Hit Record High According to Artemis, TRON\u2019s stablecoin supply hit $80 billion in June, setting a new milestone for the network. Since then, about $185 million worth of stablecoins have fled the chain. That outflow marks a sharp reversal in user habits. People who once parked their USDT and other tokens on TRON look to be shifting them to new destinations. The pullback follows a broader rotation in crypto markets where investors chase better rates or lower fees. TRON once drew crowds for its low transaction costs. Now, competing chains and Layer 2 platforms are undercutting its edge. That has cut into TRX\u2019s role as the network\u2019s workhorse token. Revenue And TVL Take A Hit Artemis figures show that TRX\u2019s total revenue plunged to just $114,000 in a single day. That number sits at a four\u2011year low. Network fees in TRON come from \u201cbandwidth\u201d and \u201cenergy,\u201d so when users batch transfers or switch to zero\u2011fee bridges, fee income collapses fast. Based on data from DeFiLlama, total value locked on TRON protocols fell by 0.50% in 24 hours, a drop from $4.80 billion to $4.85 billion. That\u2019s about $26 million walking out the door. While a half\u2011percent move might look small, it underlines a trend. Every million dollars that leaves makes it tougher for lending pools and yield farms to keep their rates up. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Near Pain Point Last Seen In October 2024 Despite the outflows, TRX hasn\u2019t broken key support levels yet. It still trades above areas that buyers defended in late spring. But if TVL keeps sliding and stablecoins continue to exit, we could see more pressure on the token\u2019s price.
