      "summary": "A sudden slide in Bitcoin\u2019s dollar value rattled traders this week after US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk tangled in public comments. The drop was sharp, and it raised questions about whether BTC can keep its upward momentum. According to market data, prices dipped quickly before finding a floor, leaving some investors on edge while others looked to on-chain figures for clues. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Exchange Reserves Slip Based on reports from CryptoQuant, the amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges fell from 2,435,600 BTC to 2,365,400 BTC over seven days. That\u2019s a nearly 3% decline. When coins leave exchanges it often means people want to hold them in private wallets. Fewer coins available to sell can tighten supply. In turn, that may help prices recover. Realized Cap Hits New High According to the same data, Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Capitalization recently hit $935 billion. It\u2019s the highest level on record. Realized Cap tracks the value of all coins at the price when they last moved on-chain. A rising number shows fresh capital flowing into Bitcoin. It suggests both small traders and large institutions are still betting on BTC\u2019s long-term value. Netflow Shows Accumulation Based on the flow of deposits and withdrawals, Bitcoin\u2019s netflow has been negative. That means more coins have left exchanges than have been deposited. Withdrawals beat deposits in trading volume. In simple terms, holders aren\u2019t looking to sell right now. It\u2019s a classic sign that buyers outnumber sellers\u2014at least in the on-chain arena. UTXO Bands Point To Holder Confidence CryptoQuant\u2019s UTXO Value Bands also reveal growing activity across multiple coin-age groups. UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Outputs. It measures the age and value of coins that haven\u2019t moved. When you see more coins in older bands and steady movement in newer ones, it tells you a variety of investors\u2014from long-term holders to recent buyers\u2014are staying active. That pattern tends to shore up market support. Related Reading: Blank Pi Network Wallets Spark Outcry\u2014What\u2019s The Network Hiding? Looking Ahead Even if Bitcoin\u2019s price can swing wildly day to day, these on-chain signals hint at solid backing underneath. Less supply on exchanges, a record realized cap of $934.88 billion, ongoing negative netflow and rising UTXO activity all point toward patient investors holding their ground. Short-term dips may still occur, especially when big names trade barbs on social media. But for many in the market, the long-term story remains intact.

      "summary": "Pseudonymous analyst CryptoInsightUK has warned that the next major move for XRP could be a trap. In a video published on June 8, the analyst outlined a scenario where XRP surges toward $2.30\u2013$2.40 in the short term\u2014only to reverse violently into a sharp liquidity flush before any sustainable breakout occurs. XRP Bull Trap Looming? \u201cI think XRP goes to sub-$2.0. I really do,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt could come and sweep the highs here\u2026 could come up to like what, $2.30, and then push us down. That would be more pain for everyone, \u2018cause everyone\u2019s going to think we\u2019re going to the upside.\u201d The setup he describes is based on market structure and liquidity dynamics, particularly the buildup of resting orders beneath XRP\u2019s current range. \u201cThis here is a concern, a real concern for me,\u201d he said, referring to the growing pool of liquidity below current prices. According to his internal models, such liquidity zones are statistically touched \u201c80% of the time.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Must Crash First\u2014Then Comes The $10 Rally, Says Analyst \u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to trick someone here,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019m cautious.\u201d Despite his near-total XRP allocation\u2014he states he&#8217;s \u201c95%+, probably more like 98%\u201d positioned in XRP\u2014CryptoInsightUK emphasized that he\u2019s not rooting for a correction. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to come down,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just showing you what I see.\u201d The analyst proposed multiple structural paths: one in which XRP immediately breaks out, and another where it briefly rallies to sweep local highs before flushing downward to form a bullish divergence. \u201cWe\u2019re in a range right now,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we come up, sweep the highs, then take the lows and go?\u201d He elaborated on the bullish divergence pattern he is watching, where price forms a lower low while the RSI (Relative Strength Index) prints a higher low\u2014a setup he uses to identify bottoming structures. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would like to see,\u201d he explained. Broader Macro Conditions Still Supportive Despite the bearish tactical setup, the video struck an upbeat macro tone. Will cited four near-term catalysts: the Genius Act on stablecoin oversight, the imminent filing deadline in the SEC\u2019s remedies phase against Ripple, the July decision window for a spot-XRP ETF proposal, and a renewed expectation of accommodative fiscal policy sparked by last week\u2019s televised Trump-Musk dialogue. \u201cWhat this really tells us is there\u2019s going to be money printing,\u201d he argued. \u201cAssets all over are going to explode to the upside and, for the other specific reasons, XRP probably does even better.\u201d Turning to Bitcoin, the analyst observed an ongoing decline in trading volume, suggesting indecision or exhaustion. \u201cThere\u2019s been no volume. There\u2019s been nothing,\u201d he said of recent BTC price action. Related Reading: XRP Wave Structure Predicts Wild Fluctuations On Its Way To $4 ATH He highlighted a CME futures gap around $92,000\u2013$93,000 and added that fixed range volume analysis points to a possible pullback zone at $96,000\u2013$97,000. \u201cIt\u2019s probably coming imminently, maybe this week,\u201d he said of a potential correction, projecting a scenario where BTC dips into this range before resuming its upward trajectory. \u201cDoes this mean we squeeze to the upside or come down and take this low and put in that bullish divergence structure?\u201d he asked, noting a similar divergence setup at $75,000 earlier this year. XRP Spot Activity Raises Red Flags In the final hour before the video, XRP had \u201csqueezed up with some volume,\u201d but the analyst urged caution. While open interest had risen sharply, funding remained green\u2014suggesting net long positioning\u2014and aggregate premium had turned red. \u201cThis indicates to me that even though there are still some shorts coming in, more longs than shorts have entered,\u201d he said. He warned that this imbalance could cause a sharp move lower if the market fails to hold current levels. \u201cIf we do now come down and lose this low, expect a more aggressive, faster move to the downside,\u201d he said, pointing to the risk of liquidating leveraged positions. XRP\u2019s relative performance against ETH and BTC also came under review. While it had begun testing resistance zones, neither the XRP/ETH nor the XRP/BTC charts had decisively broken out. \u201cWe could still be in this range chopping about,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cCould lose strength until we start to see some confirmations to the upside.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-risks-crash-31000/",
      "summary": "Over the last few weeks, the Bitcoin price has been on an upward trajectory, propelled forward mainly by institutional adoption and buying. This has seen the Bitcoin price rally to new all-time highs at $111,900, and has remained above $100,000 despite a turn in market sentiment toward the negative. However, this support has not bolstered confidence, with one analyst predicting that the leading cryptocurrency has seen the end of this bull cycle. Bitcoin Price Completes Elliot Wave Theory The Elliot Wave Theory is a chart pattern that has been widely used as Bitcoin has become more mainstream in an effort to predict where the price may be headed next. The theory consists of five full waves, at the end of which lies a bearish trend for the digital asset. So far, the Bitcoin price has been moving through different waves according to different analysts. But Sniper Academy on the TradingView platform has revealed that the five waves have been completed. Related Reading: Ethereum Head &#38; Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control? Using the 1-month Bitcoin price chart, the crypto analyst shows that there have been five different waves completed. The latest all-time high peak above $111,900 is shown to have been the fifth and final wave, suggesting that this bullish impulse is complete. Given that the Bitcoin price has now completed this theory, the crypto analyst explains that this means that the cryptocurrency has now hit the upper boundary of a long-term ascending channel. Simply put, this is very bearish for the digital asset as this means an end to its upward trajectory. Right now, the analyst showed that the Bitcoin price is already forming divergence after the completion of the fifth wave. This has triggered a weakness in the momentum and has come as a result of resistance forming between $76,000 and $111,000. This trend shows that a potential double top has been created, and that means that there is nowhere for the Bitcoin price to go now but down. BTC Price Targets $31,000 Bottom Given the fact that the crypto analyst believes that the Elliot Wave Theory has played out and the five waves have been completed, the next expectation is a sharp drop in the Bitcoin price. The first move is expected toward $66,000, which would be an almost 50% decline in price from here. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June\u2013July Rally After 5-Month Pullback However, this is not the worst of it, as the crypto analyst sees the cryptocurrency still breaking down to $53,000. Then, if this level does fail to hold, then a fall all the way down to as low as $31,000, serving as the bottom of the channel. This also coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Once the Bitcoin price is back at $31,000, the crypto analyst believes that accumulation would begin at this key zone. This will then serve as the important level that will drive the start of the next major bull cycle. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView"
