      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-70-170-jump/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price is still holding above $100,000 despite suffering a crash right before the weekend. It has since bounced back from the $104,000 level, suggesting that bulls are making their stand at this major psychological level. Now, with the crypto market sitting at what looks to be a critical point, questions are arising about what the next step could be from here. Can Bitcoin still rally, or is this the end of a rather short and underwhelming bull market? Bitcoin Price Still Has A Long Way To Go Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has been a vocal voice when it comes to the bullishness of the Bitcoin price. He has continued to call for higher prices even at a time when the wider community is expecting the cryptocurrency to keep falling from here. In fact, the crypto analyst believes that the leading crypto could see its price double from here, despite already hitting multiple new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Head &#38; Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control? In a post on X, Doctor Profit explained the reasoning behind this and why he believes that the Bitcoin price still has room to run. The first thing he pointed to was the fact that a rare Golden Cross had appeared on the Bitcoin price chart. This happened three weeks ago, and back then, the analyst called out the chart formation, explaining that this meant that the bull run was not over. This is because every time Bitcoin had flashed a Golden Cross in the past, it had been the start of another massive run. Just like now, it is first followed by a 10% decline in price, which was achieved when Bitcoin fell from $111,900 to $100,000. Now that the first part of the trend seems to have been fulfilled, expectations are that the other parts will play out similarly. In addition to this, he explains that Bitcoin has also formed its diagonal resistance, which it is now looking to break out from. A successful break would put it back above $108,000 as it gears up for the next leg-up. Macro Factors That Support The Thesis Not only does the chart technicals show this possible recovery, but the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, expected to be released on Wednesday, plays into this as well. Doctor Profit explains that Wall Street is already expecting the CPI to come in at 2.5%, a rather high number. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June\u2013July Rally After 5-Month Pullback Instead, he believes that the CPI will come in lower, putting it between 2.1% and 2.3%. A lower figure would mean that there is a slowdown in inflation, allowing room for more risk-taking and pushing markets such as stocks and crypto higher. Also, there is the matter of the negative funding rate, which suggests that there are more shorters in the market right now, expecting the price to tank. Data from Coinglass shows the Bitcoin funding rate has dropped to one of the lowest levels this year, and the analyst says this is a sign of a healthy market. \u201cOverall, I see a strong trend and markets will continue to rise with first targets between 108-110k, and this is by far not the end,\u201d Doctor Profit said. \u201cThe golden cross is promising us between 70-170% in gains in the coming months!\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "The market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable spike on Monday, surging past the $108,000 mark after a period of consolidation between $100,000 and $106,000 for the past week. This surge comes as key officials from the United States and China prepare for critical trade negotiations in London, aimed at addressing ongoing tensions and salvaging \u201ca fragile trade agreement.\u201d US-China Trade Talks Spark Investor Optimism The cryptocurrency gained 2% on Monday, briefly touching a peak of $108,900 before settling back slightly. This uptick reflects growing investor optimism regarding the potential resolution of trade disputes between the US and China, one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China\u2019s Vice Premier for Economic Policy, He Lifeng, are set to lead their respective delegations in discussions that began Monday and are expected to continue into Tuesday, as reported by Fortune. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric These negotiations are part of President Donald Trump\u2019s broader strategy to compel US trading partners to meet various demands, often through the threat of imposing significant tariffs on imports. Following the announcement of a sweeping tariff policy in April, which impacted nearly all American trading partners, Trump authorized a 90-day pause for negotiations. However, this pause did not apply to tariffs on China, which were escalated to 145%. Trade Talks Resuming As Bitcoin Prices Rise The heightened tensions between the two nations had previously led to a significant drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value, reaching a yearly low of $75,000 as fears of a trade war drove investors away from American markets. However, optimism returned following a summit in Geneva last month, where Trump announced a temporary agreement that would lower tariffs and facilitate further discussions. In the wake of this news, Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. Yet, the truce was short-lived. Trump claimed that China had violated the agreement over a dispute regarding exports of rare earth magnets. On May 30, he expressed his frustrations on Truth Social, stating, \u201cChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\u201d In an urgent attempt to salvage the deteriorating trade deal, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call last week, their first in months. Following this 90-minute conversation, it was announced that senior officials from both countries would meet in London this week to resume negotiations. In addition to trade-related factors, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price surge may also be influenced by increased activity in the cryptocurrency initial public offering (IPO) market. Wave Of Crypto IPO Activity Last week, the stablecoin giant Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shares soaring by over 168%, jumping from an initial price of $31 to $69 on the first day of trading. Additionally, Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed for an initial public offering, further demonstrating the crypto industry&#8217;s growing connection to traditional finance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The \u2018Next Impulse\u2019, Analyst Predicts \u201cWhile the IPO excitement may be short-lived, the long-term positioning of institutional investors suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin\u2019s performance through 2025,\u201d remarked David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets, in an interview with Fortune. When writing, BTC trades at $108,670, recording gains of 6% in the monthly time frame, little over 2.7% from its record high of $111,8000 reached in May.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-listed-on-nasdaq-as-solaxy-the-first-sol-layer-2-raises-46m/",
      "summary": "The NASDAQ has been bringing crypto and traditional investing together since 2025. With the June 7 filing of a standard K-8 fund, the Nasdaq noted that its standard Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS) would add four new cryptos \u2013 Cardano, Solana, Stellar Lumens, and XRP Ledger \u2013 to its current roster of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The move sets up the potential for the first-ever multi-asset crypto ETF, and signals crypto\u2019s continued ascension to the upper ranks of the financial world. The news comes on the back of reports that BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF just became the fastest-ever ETF to reach $70B in total assets. Add it all together, and it\u2019s clear that the finance world has expanded beyond recognizing just $BTC and $ETH. Solana\u2019s $83.7B market cap could be set to swell even further on the back of a potential Nasdaq listing and possible ETF inclusion. And any growth could skyrocket when critical upgrades like Solaxy, Solana\u2019s first-ever Layer-2, provide a much-needed boost to Solana scalability and reliability. ETFs: Kind Of A Big Deal Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are pools of assets listed on exchanges, letting ordinary investors gain exposure to the underlying assets without purchasing them directly. That makes them great for retail investors who may not want the struggle of setting up a crypto wallet \u2013 even a simple wallet like Best Wallet app. However, ETFs are also appealing to institutional investors, who use ETFs to diversify their portfolios. $BTC and $ETH ETFs both caused a spike in the price of their respective cryptos when they launched last year, and have been widely credited with fueling a steady increase in demand. Currently, $BTC ETFs account for 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap; $ETH ETFs hold 3.13%. In both cases, that\u2019s a significant percentage of the total market cap and adds buying pressure. A potential multi-asset ETF, from Nasdaq, no less, would do the same for any included cryptos, including Solana. Solana\u2019s Ecosystem Set to Expand Solana has historically relied on a single Rust-based validator client. That was Agave, maintained by Anza, with over 90% of stake weight running on Jito-Solana, a fork built around MEV infrastructure. The Jito-Solana consolidation boosted performance and staking returns, but raised concerns that a failure at a single point could severely disrupt the network. In a positive sign, several competing clients are emerging: Jito\u2011Solana: the original MEV solution, which jump-started the trend of validator innovation Firedancer: developed by Jump Crypto, aimed at blazing-fast, modular performance Sig: Syndica\u2019s rewrite in Zig, optimized for read-heavy workloads common in dApps Paladin: a lightweight MEV-focused fork of Jito featuring a protected \u2018P3\u2019 transaction lane to mitigate sandwich attacks and enhance fairness TinyDancer: an open-source light client designed for mobile environments, with SPV verification, data sampling, and fraud proofing Taken together, these clients represent a maturing Solana ecosystem: each addresses specific limitations and contributes to greater resilience, specialization, and decentralization. They lay the groundwork for further development on a Solana network that has seen some of the best meme coins and new crypto presales launched in recent years. And now there\u2019s another improvement on the way, just in time for any potential ETF: the first-ever Solana Layer-2 solution, Solaxy. Solaxy ($SOLX): First-Ever Solana Layer-2 for Zero Down-Time Why have investors poured $46M into the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale so far? Because the potential for a Layer 2 solution that solves some of Solana\u2019s nagging problems \u2013 like failed transactions and network congestion \u2013 is simply too great to miss. The Solaxy project brings together aspects of Ethereum\u2019s scalability and reliability, blending them with Solana\u2019s faster network speeds and lower transaction costs. The $SOLX token will be multi-chain, launching on Ethereum and bridging to the Solaxy Layer-2 when fully deployed. In the meantime, the project is already well underway. The Solaxy Block Explorer and Bridge are live on the testnet. And the token launch is imminent; there are only six days left in the presale. Any investors eager to get in early on what could be the next generation of Solana development can check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy. Tokens currently cost $0.00175, but our price prediction shows the potential for the token to hit $0.025 by the end of 2025, a 1300% increase. Visit the Solaxy presale page today. Nasdaq Listing Positions Solana \u2013 and Solaxy \u2013 As Financial Cornerstones With Nasdaq listing Solana in its crypto index and a potential ETF on the horizon, institutional demand could surge. Paired with the emergence of Solaxy, Solana is no longer just fast \u2013 it\u2019s becoming foundational, and a core part of crypto finance. Do your own research before investing; this is not financial advice. But be aware \u2013 time\u2019s running out to get in on the ground floor, with under a week left in the Solaxy presale."

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the exchanges recently received a large amount of Bitcoin inflows, but so far, the asset&#8217;s price has only been going up. Bitcoin Has Seen A Spike In Exchange Inflows Recently In a new post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Netflow for Bitcoin. The Exchange Netflow is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of the asset that&#8217;s moving into or out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchange inflows outweigh the exchange outflows. As one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the asset&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Diverge\u2014ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the holders are taking out a net number of tokens from exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow since the start of the month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has recently mostly been contained in the negative territory, but the latest value (yesterday&#8217;s) has been positive. In total, the investors have deposited a net $262.75 million of the asset to the exchange-connected wallets with this inflow spike. According to the analytics firm, this marks the first day of significant deposits since May 27th. As mentioned before, exchange inflows are something that can turn out to be bearish for the coin&#8217;s value. So far, however, the opposite has happened for Bitcoin, as its price has soared instead. This could indicate that even if there are some large holders looking to sell with these deposits, enough demand has surfaced at the same time that BTC has not only been able to ride out this wave of potential selling pressure, but actually add to its recovery. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin According to the analytics firm Glassnode, short liquidations have registered a notable uptick alongside this surge in the cryptocurrency. &#8220;Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA),&#8221; notes Glassnode. Generally, large liquidations end up providing fuel to the price move that caused them, so in this case, it&#8217;s possible the short squeeze may have provided support to the Bitcoin rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $107,900, up over 3% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, IntoTheBlock.com, chart from TradingView.com"
