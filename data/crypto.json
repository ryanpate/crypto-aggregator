      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dormant-ethereum-wallet-awakens-after-10-years-with-millions-worth-of-eth/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has been consolidating around the $2,500 price level over the past few days, showing little momentum in either direction. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has struggled to sustain a breakout above the $2,600 resistance zone, despite the inflows into Ethereum Spot ETFs last week. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump\u2019s World Liberty Connection One event that has sparked interest, and possibly concern, among Ethereum holders is the reactivation of a dormant whale wallet holding millions worth of ETH. The sudden awakening of this long-inactive address raises questions about a potential selling pressure and its market impact. First Transaction From Dormant ETH Address Since 2015 On-chain tracker Whale Alerts was the first to report the reawakening of a pre-mined Ethereum address that had been inactive for nearly a decade. According to the large on-chain transaction tracker, the wallet, which held 2,000 ETH, initiated its last transaction 9.9 years ago. When the wallet last moved any funds in 2015, the entire stash was worth just $620. Today, that same amount is valued at over $5 million, making the owner\u2019s profit roughly 820x based on current prices. At Ethereum&#8217;s all-time high price of $4,878 in 2021, the cryptocurrencies reached an unrealized gain of 1573x. \ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 2,000 #ETH (5,063,918 USD) has just been activated after 9.9 years (worth 620 USD in 2015)!https://t.co/G0i8Rif0XX \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 14, 2025 The alert by Whale Alerts, which noted the first transaction after 9.9 years, involved the transfer of 0.0001 ETH from the whale address &#8220;0xcF26&#8221; to address &#8220;0x2C12,&#8221; which is a newly created ETH address. However, Etherscan&#8217;s on-chain transaction data reveals that the whale address sent 500 ETH into the newly created address shortly afterward. Following the string of transaction data from Etherscan shows that these 500 ETH eventually made their way into address &#8220;0x28C6,&#8221; which is known to be owned and controlled by crypto exchange Binance. This means that the 500 ETH may have already been sold through the exchange or are currently being prepared for liquidation. Brace For Impact: Will The Remaining 1,500 ETH Be Sold? As of now, the original whale address still holds approximately 1,500 ETH, currently valued at $3.796 million. However, it opens up the question of whether the rest of the funds will also be sold. Although we cannot be sure of a planned full liquidation, the pattern of the 500 ETH transfer and the involvement of an exchange address indicate that the possibility cannot be dismissed. Right now, Ethereum is in a fragile price action around the $2,500 price level. If more ETH is offloaded by the whale, the added selling pressure could make it even harder for Ethereum to break out of its current consolidation phase, especially if there isn&#8217;t enough buying pressure to absorb the ETH sold off.

Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt According to market commentator John Squire, the real story is the seven years of setbacks that preceded this jump. \u201cIf patience was a crypto token, XRP holders would already be billionaires,\u201d he said, pointing to the years of holding through crashes and legal fights. If patience was a token, $XRP holders would be billionaires already. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 8, 2025 XRP Rallies As Markets Turn After a rough patch, XRP\u2019s jump has caught many off guard. The coin rocketed from roughly $0.11 at the start of November 2024 to near $0.75 by the end of January 2025. Volume ticked up on most trading platforms, suggesting fresh money is pushing the price higher. Traders who stuck it out through years of mild gains and deep dips finally saw a payoff. Seven Years Of Price Struggles From March 2017 to January 2018, XRP shot up more than 68,000%, peaking at $3.84. Based on on\u2011chain data, that blistering run led to a brutal 97% slide by March 2020, when prices hit $0.1140. In November 2020, another bounce nearly doubled the price\u2014but the US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit undercut that move, sending XRP down 67% in December 2020, its largest monthly loss ever. Holder Numbers Climb Amid Lawsuit Despite all that, the number of XRP holders kept growing. According to Santiment, about 986,000 wallets held XRP in January 2018. By December 2022, over 3.53 million new addresses had joined the network, pushing the total past 4.5 million. That surge of interest came even as many US and Canadian exchanges paused trading. It shows that newcomers and long\u2011time believers piled in while regulators and markets wrestled with the fallout. Recovery Faces Headwinds From Market Cycles While the latest rally is impressive, it comes against a mixed crypto backdrop. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown uneven strength, and overall sentiment is cautious. Some traders warn that sharp gains can trigger profit\u2011taking events, especially if the wider market cools or if the SEC lawsuit sees new twists. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump\u2019s World Liberty Connection Analysts Eye Bigger Gains Some voices in the space are setting high bars.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solaxy-presale-burns-red-hot-as-whales-snatch-495k-in-two-days-best-presale-ends-tomorrow/",
      "summary": "With Solaxy ($SOLX) nearing the end of its presale stage, both anticipation for its listing and urgency among investors to grab the best altcoin at its lowest-ever price are higher than ever. Whale investors have gobbled up more than $500K worth of $SOLX tokens over the past 24 hours, taking Solaxy&#8217;s total presale raise to over $51M. Some of these include transactions worth $113K, $59K, and $58K. Keep reading to find out why the industry can&#8217;t keep their hands off Solana&#8217;s best crypto project yet and why buying the $SOLX presale now could be one of the smartest moves you make as a crypto investor. What&#8217;s the Hype About Solaxy? Solaxy is a new meme coin currently on presale, but it&#8217;s different from other meme cryptos in that it has a real-world application. It&#8217;s what the industry calls a utility token. $SOLX&#8217;s selling point is that it plans to restore Solana&#8217;s efficiency and performance by building the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the network. Despite its otherwise meme coin-tailored infrastructure, Solana was never designed to service a truckload of transaction requests at once. However, this is exactly what it has been asked to do ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, as well as other top trending cryptos. They flooded Solana with new investors. Thanks to Solaxy&#8217;s new L2, though, Solana&#8217;s mainnet will finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief. It will reduce the burden on the mainnet by offloading transactions onto a sidechain. As for the sidechain, think of it as an express lane on a busy highway (the L1), helping it service the extra traffic during peak hours. Optimizing Solana: Lower Fees Without Sacrificing Security In addition to creating a more scalable and efficient blockchain environment, Solaxy will also contribute to lowering investor costs on Solana. It will do so by bundling transactions into single, optimized batches. Essentially, this means that it will process multiple transactions in bulk rather than one by one, thereby lowering the cost per transaction. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Solaxy will revitalize Solana without compromising security. Its cutting-edge roll-up technology will validate the transactions on the network&#8217;s Layer 1. Solaxy&#8217;s Hyperlane Collaboration In its quest to ensure Solana occupies the center stage of the rapidly growing DeFi and Web3 space, Solaxy has joined hands with Hyperlane. Hyperlane, in case you didn&#8217;t know, is a Web3 infrastructure project that will help $SOLX make bridging (which means transferring tokens from one blockchain to another) between Solana and Ethereum easier, quicker, and more seamless. Developers, investors, and traders on Solana will, therefore, be able to transfer cryptos between Solana and Ethereum with as much ease as though they were using an everyday mobile app. And consider the enrichment this will bring to Solana and its users. Not only does Ethereum have a lot more liquidity than Solana, but it also has a huge network (over 10x that of Solana) of decentralized applications, with over 5K dApps live right now. Solaxy Presale: Your Last Chance at 11,200% Gains As mentioned earlier, Solaxy&#8217;s presale, which is currently ongoing (over $51M in funding as of now), has generated a lot of buzz among both crypto whales and retail investors alike. Solaxy&#8217;s presale officially kicked off in December 2024, with an initial per-token price of just $0.001. Through multiple presale rounds, however, one $SOLX currently stands at $0.00176. So, had you joined the best crypto presale while it was brand-new, you&#8217;d have already seen a nifty 76% increase in your investment. However, you can let bygones be bygones and make it up to your crypto portfolio by buying into the Solaxy presale now. According to our $SOLX price prediction, the token can reach a whopping $0.20 by 2030. This means you can eke out a brain-melting 11,200% return (calculated from current prices) on your investment. Here&#8217;s the most important piece of information, though: Solaxy&#8217;s presale ends in less than 24 hours from now, so this is really your last chance to grab potentially the next crypto to explode before&#8230;it explodes. Real Utility, Big Ambitions, and a Limited-Time Offer Backed by real utility, a Hyperlane partnership that promises to make it more than just a scaling tool, and bold price forecasts, Solaxy ($SOLX) could be crypto&#8217;s next big thing. Don\u2019t sit this one out; invest in Solaxy before the presale ends tomorrow. One token is currently selling for just $0.00176. However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky. This article isn&#8217;t financial advice, and we urge you to do your own research before investing."

      "summary": "Bitcoin is still trying to regain short-term bullish momentum, as shown by its price action in the past 24 hours. After briefly slipping below $104,500, the cryptocurrency bounced back to trade above $106,000, and technical analysis now shows a technical formation that could cause the start of a more extended rally. Interestingly, as seen in the daily Ichimoku chart shared by analyst Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin is currently on the verge of confirming a golden cross, which is a bullish signal, within the coming days. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin \u2013 Details Ichimoku Cloud Builds Case For Bullish Breakout Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted the recent daily price close above the Tenkan line as a strong technical signal for Bitcoin. The Tenkan, also known as the conversion line, is an intriguing indicator for short-term trend strength in Ichimoku analysis. According to the analyst, the current setup on Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart shows the conditions aligning for a golden cross where the shorter-term average overtakes the longer-term one, which is a potential long-term bullish shift. This crossover, if confirmed, would be one of the most reliable trend-reversal patterns in technical trading. Right now, Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is consolidating around $105,000. However, if this golden cross does play out well, Bitcoin could attempt another run toward the key resistance level around $111,600. However, current geopolitical instability, especially the rising tensions in the Middle East, could disrupt this technical picture at any moment and cause a reassessment of the bullish outlook. Image From X: Titan of Crypto Support And Whale Activity Clash With Bullish Setup Despite the bullish technical backdrop, other market signals are flashing warnings for Bitcoin. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez identified $104,124 as an important support level for Bitcoin. This price point is not just arbitrary, as it represents a heavy concentration of UTXO realized prices. Many investors bought in at that level, and if Bitcoin falls below it, the next likely destination could be $97,405. The URPD chart confirms that the safety net between $104,000 and $97,000 is somewhat thin. This means that once $104,000 is breached to the downside, a swift and steep correction could follow due to the lack of strong buying interest in that gap. Image From X: Ali_charts Further complicating the picture is the behavior of large Bitcoin holders. On-chain data shows that some of the biggest whales, addresses holding over 1,000 BTC, have started reducing their holdings in recent days. This decline in whale wallet count initially began shortly after Bitcoin reached its new all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. The reduction in whale count resumed again after Bitcoin was rejected at the $110,000 region early last week.

      "summary": "The Bitcoin market continues to react negatively to rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran which has induced a wave of concern in the financial markets. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation movement between $105,000 &#8211; $106,000 following slight, after prices crashed to below $103,000 on Friday. Meanwhile, prominent analytics company Glassnode has shared some valuable insight into the Bitcoin market dissecting the growth of the current bull cycle so far. Bitcoin Demand Matches Maturation Rate In an X post on June 14, Glassnode draws comparisons of Bitcoin price growth in the present market cycle to previous ones. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump\u2019s World Liberty Connection Notably, the crypto market cycle is a recurring four-year period marked by consecutive phases of accumulation, a bull market, distribution and a bear market. In the last two cycles i.e 2015-2018 and 2018-2022, Bitcoin achieved price gains of 1076% and 1007%, respectively, significantly multiplying its market cap. For the current cycle from 2022 till date, Bitcoin\u2019s prices have now grown by 656%. While this figure is far off previous cycles, Glassnode reports that it&#8217;s a commendable achievement considering the premier cryptocurrency\u2019s maturation in the past four years marked by an exposure to institutional investors and a $2 trillion valuation. Generally, assets are expected to produce little exponential growth with continued price growth. This can be seen with gold only achieving an estimated 192% growth over the past 10 years. Therefore, Glassnode notes that Bitcoin\u2019s 6x market gain since 2022 is highly positive development that reflects a sustainable market demand even as the asset\u2019s market cap grows. Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $105,540 following a slight 0.20% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset\u2019s daily trading volume is down by 35.39% representing significant fall in market participation. Interestingly, reputable analytics firm Sentora reports the Bitcoin network weekly fees fell by 3.31% following recent negative political events coupled with an already uncertain market sentiment. Meanwhile, exchange inflows also grew by $2.4 billion indicating a significant amount of investors are looking to distribute their holdings while the premier cryptocurrency struggles to re-establish a bullish price direction.
