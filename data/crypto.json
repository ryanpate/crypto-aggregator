      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-7-month-consolidation/",
      "summary": "After months of sideways movement, XRP may finally be gearing up for a significant breakout. According to analysts, the popular altcoin saw a dramatic 700% surge earlier last year. Now, its price is positioned to exit a seven-month consolidation phase, which could set it up for its next bullish move. XRP Gets Ready For Major Bullish Move A recently published technical chart by market expert \u2018Crypto Michael\u2019 on X (formerly Twitter) reveals that XRP has been consolidating for seven months following a staggering 700% price rally, which was triggered by a breakout from a multi-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern. The chart, based on a 3-month candlestick, shows that XRP had been in a major price compression within the triangle pattern for seven years. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance True to form, XRP finally broke above the upper trendline of the pennant in late 2024, igniting one of its most powerful quarterly rallies to date. This breakout led to a price surge of about 700%, pushing the cryptocurrency from around $0.6 to over $2. Since the dramatic breakout, XRP has entered a stabilization phase, trading sideways in what appears to be a healthy consolidation range. The chart highlights this consolidation area with a white circle, indicating a well-defined post-breakout phase. Notably, XRP\u2019s $2.15 price at the time of the analysis is above prior resistance levels, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is maintaining strength while waiting for its next bullish catalyst. Crypto Michael points out that XRP\u2019s consolidation is ending just as Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, approaches a critical juncture: the \u201c8-year line.\u201d This correlation suggests that a broader shift in market sentiment may be underway. Historically, leading altcoins like XRP have followed Bitcoin\u2019s lead during broader market rallies. If BTC successfully breaks through this long-standing line, Crypto Michael believes it could serve as a macro trigger that ignites a fresh bullish move for XRP. Analyst Says The Altcoin Is Set To Explode Against BTC A fresh analysis by Egrag Crypto, a crypto analyst on X, suggests that the XRP/BTC pair could be on the edge of a major breakout. The pair has followed a consistent cycle for over a decade, with lows in 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2024\u2014each succeeded by strong rallies. These lows align with a rising trendline, signaling possible long-term strength. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Structure Remains Bullish: Analyst Releases 3 New Targets Now, XRP/BTC is approaching a key resistance level that has blocked past rallies since 2015. This time, however, Egrag Crypto suggests that the setup looks different and slightly more favorable for a breakout. If the pair breaks above this multi-year ceiling, it could mark a major turning point, effectively leading XRP into an explosive bullish phase. The analyst\u2019s chart outlines two potential paths: a green breakout zone if XRP pushes higher and a red rejection zone if it fails to break this key resistance again.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has weathered a wave of volatility in recent days, triggered by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. As geopolitical tensions rise and global markets grapple with uncertainty, risk assets like BTC have faced increased pressure. Yet despite this turbulent backdrop, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its footing above key support levels, demonstrating notable resilience. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues \u2013 Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Currently trading just under its all-time high, Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase that many analysts view as the calm before a potential breakout. Top analyst Rekt Capital shared insights indicating that the final major Weekly resistance, which has previously capped price rallies, may now be weakening as a point of rejection. If confirmed, this shift could signal a critical turning point in the market structure and open the door to price discovery. Investors are watching closely as BTC holds strong while macro headwinds\u2014including rising US Treasury yields and fears of energy disruptions\u2014continue to swirl. With the broader market bracing for further developments in the Middle East, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to maintain higher lows and approach resistance with momentum suggests that the bulls may soon reclaim full control. The coming days could prove pivotal for the next phase of BTC\u2019s market cycle. Bitcoin Awaits Clarity As Middle East Tensions Shape Market Sentiment The conflict between Israel and Iran continues to dominate headlines and exert influence over global markets. As tensions escalate, investors remain cautious, closely monitoring geopolitical developments and their macroeconomic ripple effects. In this uncertain environment, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase, with neither bulls nor bears fully in control. The lack of a clear direction stems from diverging investor expectations. Optimistic market participants anticipate that a diplomatic resolution may be reached in the coming days or weeks. A peace deal could reduce market anxiety, drive oil prices lower, and reignite momentum across risk assets\u2014Bitcoin included. On the other hand, more cautious investors fear that the situation could worsen. Prolonged conflict may spark volatility in the energy sector, push inflation higher, and strain economic stability, particularly in regions dependent on oil imports. This week may prove decisive for Bitcoin\u2019s next major move. Price action remains tightly bound, but all eyes are on the long-standing Weekly resistance. According to Rekt Capital, the final major Weekly resistance\u2014once a strong rejection point\u2014now appears to be weakening. This shift in structure suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for a breakout into price discovery territory, should macro conditions stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support \u2013 Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels BTC Price Holds Above Key Support Amid Consolidation The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin shows that BTC continues to trade within a tight range, holding above the critical $103,600 support while struggling to break cleanly through the $109,300 resistance. This zone has repeatedly acted as a ceiling for price action since early May, with sellers stepping in around $109K and buyers defending dips near $104K. The recent bounce from just above the $103,600 level reflects ongoing buyer interest at that range, reinforced by the 100-day SMA (green), which is providing dynamic support. Meanwhile, the 50-day SMA (blue) is curling slightly upward, showing early signs of positive momentum, although the price has yet to clearly reclaim and hold above it. Volume remains moderate, indicating a lack of strong conviction on either side. For bulls to regain full control, BTC must push through the $109,300 resistance with sustained volume and hold that breakout level. A failure to do so may result in another rejection and a potential retest of the lower boundary near $103,600. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-key-reversal-pattern/",
      "summary": "Crypto Sat recently took to X to share a technical insight on Dogecoin, revealing that the asset is showing signs of accumulation following a sharp correction. According to the analyst, the 2-hour chart is beginning to shape a potential double bottom pattern. Should this structure be confirmed, it might signal a renewed upward push for DOGE, catching the interest of short-term traders and long-term holders. Make-or-Break Moment For Dogecoin: The Neckline Battle Ahead Dogecoin is currently displaying the characteristics of a double bottom formation, a classic reversal setup that could signal a shift in momentum, as noted by Crypto Sat. The first bottom was established around the $0.170 mark, following a significant price drop, where buyers initially stepped in to defend the zone. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level\u2014Or Risk A 30% Price Crash Shortly after, DOGE made a move back down for a second test of the same support area, with a higher low structure forming, suggesting weakening bearish pressure and the emergence of early accumulation. The key area to watch is the neckline resistance, which sits in the $0.198 to $0.200 range. Crypto Sat emphasizes that a breakout above the neckline would serve as strong technical confirmation of a shift in market sentiment. If bulls manage to push through, it might open the door for a sustained upward rally, as traders gain confidence in the reversal setup taking hold. Here Are Key Signals To Watch In the analysis, Crypto Sat has outlined several key signals to watch as Dogecoin&#8217;s price action tightens. One early bullish sign, he notes, is the rising volume on the second bottom, a subtle but important clue that buyers may be stepping in with growing conviction. Volume often leads price, and this uptick could mark the start of renewed upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant\u2014What\u2019s The Target? The crucial level to monitor is the resistance zone around $0.200. A strong breakout above this zone could trigger a technical shift, paving the way for a potential rally toward the $0.220 and $0.230 range. Such a move would confirm the double bottom formation and likely attract more bullish participation as confidence builds. However, if price fails to break through the neckline, support around $0.165 becomes the next critical level. A bounce from that zone would keep the pattern alive, but a clean drop below it could invalidate the setup and suggest further downside risk. Sharing his personal outlook, Crypto Sat believes DOGE may be positioning for a breakout, but cautions traders to be patient. &#8220;Let the neckline decide the next big move,&#8221; he advises, underscoring the importance of watching for confirmation before making aggressive plays.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-dominance-above-64/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Daan Crypto has provided an analysis of the rising Bitcoin dominance, explaining why this will likely continue to surge. Based on his analysis, the altcoin season is unlikely to come anytime soon, with many alts suffering significant selling pressure while BTC accumulation increases. Bitcoin Dominance Surge Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season In an X post, Daan Crypto stated that the Bitcoin Dominance shows no signs of stopping following the latest surge above 64%. He indicated that the dominance will only continue to rise as more treasury companies try to accumulate Bitcoin. Meanwhile, on the other hand, hopes of an altcoin season fade away as many altcoins are plagued with big unlocks and downtrending momentum. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises Daan Crypto also alluded to how there was a short squeeze last month on Ethereum, which took a lot of coins with it. However, this momentum quickly faded afterwards, again dashing hopes of an altcoin season. The analyst explained that there wasn\u2019t sufficient spot bid to bid most of these coins up further. Meanwhile, he cautioned market participants to pick their altcoin investments wisely. Daan Crypto remarked that most of them will underperform BTC over a larger timeframe. His warning suggests that the Bitcoin dominance will continue to trend upwards while an altcoin season may not happen anytime soon. Basically, there is a lack of interest and capital in these altcoins to spark an altcoin season, which could see them outperform BTC. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin dominance is surging thanks to massive adoption from institutional investors. These companies are looking to adopt Strategy\u2019s playbook or gain exposure through the Bitcoin ETFs. BlockchainCenter data shows that it is still Bitcoin season and nowhere near altcoin season. For it to be altcoin season, 75% of the top 50 coins need to have outperformed BTC over the last 90 days. Only ten altcoins have outperformed the flagship crypto during this period. Altseason Is Still Coming, But Slowly In an X post, crypto analyst Astronomer assured that the altcoin season is still coming, although it could take a while. He noted that the price remains the same for these altcoins, but declared that nothing has changed. The analyst remarked that this lines up with the overall plan of the Bitcoin price ranging till the end of June and altcoins remaining in their local ranges. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Astronomer also indicated that BTC needs to break out while the Bitcoin dominance remains below 65% for all parts of the plan for an altcoin season to be completed. The analyst urged market participants to be patient, expressing his confidence that an altcoin season would still occur. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $107,300, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

At roughly the same time, it unveiled plans for a $499 Trump\u2011branded smartphone and service plan. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Truth Social Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF According to the registration statement dated June 16, the proposed ETF would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and the remaining 25% in Ethereum. If the SEC clears the way, the fund will list on NYSE Arca under a sponsor agreement with Yorkville America Digital. The plan is to store both coins in direct custody, meaning the ETF will actually hold the digital tokens rather than futures contracts or other derivatives. Crypto.com Handles Custody And Staking Based on reports, Crypto.com will serve as the ETF\u2019s sole custodian and prime execution agent. The company will also provide staking and liquidity services for the Ethereum portion. That setup could ease SEC concerns, given the regulator\u2019s focus on secure storage and clear oversight. Still, there\u2019s no guarantee the ETF will win approval. Past spot crypto ETF proposals have faced delays and rejections due to worries over market manipulation and investor protection.
