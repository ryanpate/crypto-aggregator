      "summary": "Leading crypto exchange Binance witnessed a significant outflow of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on June 23, with investors pulling out over 4,000 BTC and 61,000 ETH in a single day. This shift comes amid easing geopolitical tensions and declining inflation, fuelling speculation about a renewed rally. Bitcoin Likely To Rally As Global Tensions Simmer According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin is likely to resume its upward trajectory, bolstered by a series of recent macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The analyst highlighted multiple positive signals that could propel the top digital asset closer to its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Yearly Trend Suggests Cycle Top Near $205,000 By Year-End, Analyst Says One of the key developments was an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who stated that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between Israel and Iran. This deal removes the immediate threat of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital chokepoint for global oil supply. The ceasefire had an immediate and positive effect on global equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 index surpassing 6,000 for the first time since February 2025. This recovery signals growing investor confidence as geopolitical risks subside. In addition, crude oil prices dropped by 14%, adding to the disinflationary narrative. Lower energy costs help reduce production and transportation expenses, thereby supporting a broader decline in inflationary pressures. Taha concluded: The convergence of significant crypto outflows from Binance, falling oil prices, a bullish breakout in US equities, and the reduction of Middle Eastern tensions presents a striking scenario. With the geopolitical overhang removed, inflation easing, and macro markets stabilizing, Bitcoin is now well-positioned to resume its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales &#8211; wallets holding large amounts of BTC &#8211; appear to be quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout. In another CryptoQuant post, contributor Mignolet noted that whale accumulation has been rising steadily since BTC bottomed in April. Mignolet pointed out that whale activity typically increases during periods of low market attention or heightened fear, often foreshadowing bullish reversals. Historical data supports this trend, showing that increased accumulation often precedes significant price surges. Bullish Quarter For BTC In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that BTC is set to close a bullish monthly candle, reinforcing the long-term uptrend for the flagship cryptocurrency. Several other on-chain and technical indicators also suggest further upside potential. For example, Bitcoin Binary CDD shows that long-term holders are continuing to hold rather than sell, indicating strong conviction in BTC\u2019s long-term value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern \u2013 Is $150,000 The Next Target? At the same time, the number of short positions is climbing as BTC consolidates between $100,000 and $110,000. This dynamic raises the probability of a short squeeze, potentially propelling Bitcoin to a new ATH. At press time, BTC trades at $105,408, up 5.2% in the past 24 hours.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-exchange-activity-declines-as-accumulation-patterns-persist/",
      "summary": "Following a weekend dip, Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 price mark, signaling renewed short-term strength amid geopolitical tensions. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,323, up by 4% in the last 24 hours. The price recovery arrives in broader investor sentiment shifts, both in on-chain behavior and exchange activity. A recent analysis from CryptoQuant\u2019s analyst Darkfost sheds light on a multi-year transition among Bitcoin holders. The analyst observes that fewer Bitcoin addresses are depositing coins onto exchanges, a trend that has persisted since the end of the 2021 market cycle. This declining activity may not necessarily suggest fading interest in BTC, but rather a transformation in how investors interact with the asset, potentially hinting at longer-term strategies becoming the norm. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Drop Below $100k Sparks Bearish Chatter, But Data Says Something Else Decline in Exchange Deposits Suggests Structural Market Shift According to Darkfost, between 2015 and 2021, the number of Bitcoin addresses depositing funds to exchanges steadily increased, peaking at an annual average of around 180,000. However, this upward trend has reversed sharply in the years since. The 10-year moving average now hovers around 90,000, while the 30-day average has fallen to 48,000. Most recently, the daily figure dropped to just 37,000. Darkfost mentioned: This reflects a significant behavioral change among BTC investors, which can likely be attributed to several key factors : &#8211; One major factor is the arrival of ETFs, which allow exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price performance without the complexity or risk of directly managing the asset. Additionally, the current market cycle has seen relatively low retail participation, which historically contributed to exchange deposits. More notably, an increasing number of investors, ranging from individuals to institutions, are treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or treasury reserve asset rather than a short-term speculative vehicle. The CryptoQuant analyst added: These shifts, which have emerged gradually over time, are precisely what drive Bitcoin&#8217;s evolving identity in financial markets. It may well be this transformation that ultimately solidifies BTC\u2019s role as a store of value. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Patterns Emerge Amid Lower Volume In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, focused on activity by large holders on the Bybit exchange. He highlighted that as general market interest and trading volume diminish, the trading patterns of whales become more visible. Mignolet noted that previous periods of reduced sentiment and low volume often saw significant whale accumulation, which historically preceded upward price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern\u2014Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead This pattern, according to Mignolet, appears to be repeating. Since Bitcoin&#8217;s local bottom in April, consistent accumulation by large entities has been observed on Bybit. He suggested this could be a signal of underlying market confidence, particularly when retail activity is minimal. While not a guaranteed forecast, historical parallels imply that such behavior may again precede broader price strength, lending weight to ongoing consolidation as a potential setup for future momentum.

      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s price roller-coaster has drawn a dramatic wager from big players. While many smaller traders are bracing for more losses, a handful of massive accounts have broken the surface and put millions in a massive show of force. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Ethereum Whale Bets Surface According to on-chain data, one whale opened a long position worth $101 million at an entry price of $2,247, using 25x leverage. That bet paid off with roughly $950,000 in profit, but it also cost $2.5 million in fees. These numbers show just how high the stakes have become. High Fees Cut Into Gains This whale further withdrew 18,000 $ETH worth $40.38M from #Binance. Now, the whale holds 50,256 $ETH worth $112.62M, currently down $2.24M Address: 0x3952d69643f7a87237c7fc8bb33f8453c0b45500 https://t.co/49vC0iqMZP pic.twitter.com/rF5cX2gsXZ \u2014 Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 23, 2025 Based on reports from On-Chain Lens, another whale moved over $40 million in Ether from Binance before opening its own leveraged trade. Combine the two wallets and you\u2019ve got about $112 million riding on an ETH bounce. Yet those $2.5 million in fees highlight the hidden cost of big bets. Middle East Tension Hits Prices ETH slipped to about $2,113 on Sunday, marking its lowest level in 30 days. That drop came after US military strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. United States President Donald Trump called the operation a \u201cspectacular success\u201d and warned of more action if Iran didn\u2019t back down. Traders say the fallout from those strikes rattled global markets and fed crypto volatility. Retail Traders Watch Closely Retail traders tend to sell when prices drop. But these whales have the scope to weather downswings. Their large purchases indicate that they find value at current levels. Short traders might not agree, however. They&#8217;re sitting in many short positions, expecting ETH to decline further before it will rise. What The Whales See Experts say large holders tend to have lower break-even points. They can afford to wait months or years for a payoff. Some also use complex strategies across multiple markets. That makes their moves hard to read from the outside. Still, when you see $112 million on the line, it\u2019s a hint that smart money senses a buying window. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Risks On Both Sides Leveraged trades amplify gains and losses equally. A 5% drop would trigger a forced sell-off on a 25x position. That could feed a sharp decline in ETH\u2019s price. On the other hand, if the market turns up, those whales could pocket big returns well beyond what retail traders see. Investors will be watching every market swing. If geopolitical tensions cool and big money stays bullish, ETH could find footing above $2,200. But another shock\u2014political or technical\u2014might send the price tumbling again.
