      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-primed-90000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price, while still holding above $100,000, has not exactly inspired confidence in the crypto community recently. This comes as the digital asset failed to break above new all-time highs during last week\u2019s rallies and, with the Israel-Iran conflict, saw a sharp plunge, erasing its weekly gains. Amid this, the bears have gained even more ground and are now more in control of the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Thus, the probability of a deep crash is heightened during this time. Bitcoin Price Could Crash Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, pseudonymous crypto analyst MIRZA has called for a possible Bitcoin price crash that could send the market spiraling even more. The crypto analyst points to the rising weakness of the Bitcoin price and the formation of bearish patterns on its price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions The first notable bearish development was the fact that the Bitcoin price had been unable to break above $111,000 despite coming close last week. Since this is where the resistance for the previous all-time high lies, it shows that there is still not enough strength in the digital asset to continue its ascent. The result of this was the decline that sent it back toward the $103,000 as bears took a stand once more. This bearish drop suggests that the asset is now forming a potential double top or a lower high structure. Both of this are bad signs for any asset as it suggests that the upward momentum has ended and there is nowhere to go but down. This change in momentum toward the negative suggests that there could be a liquidity grab at lower levels. The crypto analyst predicts that there is a possibility that the upward trend could continue if the Bitcoin price is able to break above $107,000 and maintain it. Otherwise, the Bitcoin price is expected to crash by more than 15%, pushing it below $90,000 and as low as $85,000 before a bottom is established. BTC Bearish Sentiment Grows MIRZA is not the only crypto analyst who has called a possible price crash for Bitcoin. RLinda, also took to the platform to share what she expects next for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. She points out that the Israel-Iran conflict was the reason that the Bitcoin price lost its bullish trend and was trending back downward at this point. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance However, Bitcoin continues to hold support above $100,000 so far, which has shown some strength. As a result, the analyst explains that the BTC price could end up ranging between $102,500 and $106,200 for a while as a result. The end of this, however, could end up going two ways. If Bitcoin breaks above $106,200, then it has a shot to rise above $110,000 again. However, if it loses the $102,500 support, then the next crash would send it toward $100,000 again.
