Related Reading: Injective Prepares For Bullish Reversal Amid 25% Recovery \u2013 Analyst Forecasts Massive Breakout Solana Sits At Decisive Level On Wednesday, Solana fell to the $143 mark after failing to reclaim a crucial area lost over a week ago. Following the May breakout, the cryptocurrency hovered between the $148-$184 price range, hitting a four-month high of $187 at the end of last month. However, the June market pullback saw SOL lose its range and move toward the $144-$148 levels. This area was briefly lost during the weekend retrace, with Solana falling to the $125 support level before recovering. Over the past three days, the altcoin has surged nearly 15%, touching the $148 barrier on Wednesday morning, which has been one of the key levels since May. After recovering from the recent drop, SOL has attempted to reclaim this level, but was rejected once again. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted that Solana \u201cjust completed a very nice V-shaped recovery from the low,\u201d but noted that the cryptocurrency is at a \u201cvery delicate level\u201d as it trades within the $144-$148 zone. He suggested that investors should pay attention to this area, as a reclaim of the $148 resistance could propel the price to a \u201cquick move to the upside.\u201d On the contrary, rejection from this level and losing the $144 range low could signal that the recent price action was a bearish retest. Analyst Man of Bitcoin affirmed that a \u201csustained break above the resistance zone would be the first signal that the chart has formed a low.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows new investors have been coming into Chainlink (LINK) as the MVRV Ratio signals a potential long-term opportunity for the asset. Chainlink Has Seen Its Total Holder Count Reach A New High In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Total Amount of Holders metric for Chainlink. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the LINK network that are carrying some non-zero balance. Related Reading: Tron\u2019s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered\u2014Here\u2019s Who Was Behind It Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the value of the metric has changed during the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Total Amount of Holders observed an inflection point earlier this year and has since been climbing up at a notable rate. This suggests that new non-empty wallets are popping up on the network. This kind of trend can arise due to a number of reasons. Fresh investors coming into the space or old ones who sold before making a return naturally contribute to an increase in the indicator. Another factor could be existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes. In general, all of these could be assumed to be occurring simultaneously to a degree whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, the recent uptrend in the metric could indicate that some net adoption (that is, the influx of new investors) has steadily been taking place for Chainlink. Over the past month, 7,903 new non-zero balance addresses have joined the chain, bringing the Total Amount of Holders to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 769,380. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of another indicator: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This metric basically compares how the value held by the BTC investors (the market cap) compares against the value put in by them (the realized cap). In other words, the indicator tells us about the profit-loss balance of the holders. Here, the version of the MVRV Ratio that&#8217;s relevant is the 365-day version, capturing the situation of the investors who bought their coins within the past year. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the 1-year MVRV Ratio of Chainlink is currently sitting at a negative 17.3%, an indication that these traders are, on average, holding a loss of 17.3%. Generally, however, investors being underwater isn&#8217;t actually a bad thing for the cryptocurrency. This is because holders in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling. As such, Santiment notes that the trend in the 365-day MVRV Ratio could suggest the asset&#8217;s &#8220;long-term investing timeframe is in an opportunity zone.&#8221; LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $13.15, up more than 2% in the last seven days.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has resumed its upward movement, maintaining strength above the $107,000 level as market momentum builds toward the asset\u2019s recent all-time high above $111,000. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,242, reflecting a 1.3% gain over the past 24 hours and a 2.7% rise in the past week. The market\u2019s rebound comes after a brief dip last weekend, suggesting that investor confidence remains resilient heading into the next potential leg up. Contributing to the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant analyst \u0130brahim CO\u015eAR recently highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s successful reclaim of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which he described as a key level to track for short-term price trends. Related Reading: Fast-Tracking A Bitcoin Rally: Expert Identifies 3 Bullish Catalysts Bitcoin Reclaims Key Technical Level, Eyes $120K Potential According to CO\u015eAR, the 50-day EMA often acts as dynamic support during corrections, and regaining this level typically precedes a price rally. In past cycles, similar conditions have led to gains between 10% to 20% shortly after the level was reclaimed. CO\u015eAR further noted that Bitcoin\u2019s reclaim of the 50-day EMA occurred after a short-lived breakdown, which was quickly reversed with three consecutive daily closes above the level. This technical setup mirrors previous instances that preceded substantial upward moves. CO\u015eAR also cautioned that while the technical structure favors continued gains, geopolitical uncertainties, especially involving the US, Israel, and Iran, could introduce sudden volatility. As a result, he advised market participants to avoid leveraged positions in the short term and remain prepared for potential price swings. CO\u015eAR wrote: That said, geopolitical developments\u2014particularly any positive or negative news involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran\u2014could trigger sudden volatility in BTC\u2019s price. Please avoid using leverage during this period and remain cautious in the face of potential market swings. Further Into Technicals: Analyst Points to Bullish Flag Adding to the conversation, independent crypto analyst Captain Faibik suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s price pattern is forming a bullish flag, a common continuation pattern in technical analysis. According to Faibik, while the structure indicates a likely breakout, a final corrective dip to the $97,000\u2013$98,000 range may occur before upward momentum resumes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall He emphasized that a confirmed breakout above the $108,000 resistance would be a key signal, potentially setting the stage for a mid-term target of $130,000. $BTC is currently forming Bullish flag Pattern, but there\u2019s a chance we could see one more correction before the massive Bullish Rally begins..
