On June 5, Bitcoin traded around $104,300, down 0.50% in 24 hours and off 2.5% over the past seven days. Yet data shows more people are joining the network, and more coins are being passed around. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Wallet Creation Jump According to Santiment, on May 29 nearly 557,000 new wallets appeared. That was the highest number since December 2023. It means thousands of people are opening wallets even though price has stayed just under $105,000. People normally open new wallets to send and receive bitcoins but they somehow come across the idea through new sources, increased talks among friends or create simple curiosity. In any case, an increased wallet holding indeed indicates a much wider usage. \ud83d\udcca Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain activity has seen sharp rises this week as its price hovers just below $105K: \ud83d\udcc8 May 29th: 556,830 new $BTC wallets created (Highest since December 2, 2023) \ud83d\udd04 June 2nd: 241,360 coins circulated (Highest since December 8, 2024) Growth in a network&#8217;s\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2DxknVXrKT \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 5, 2025 Increased Token Movement On June 2, over 241,360 BTC changed hands. This was deemed the busiest day since December 2024. Reports from Santiment suggest that high coin turnover usually coincides with increased traffic. Traders might be moving coins in and out of exchanges, or investors could be shifting wallets. Big swings in daily token movement can point to a shift in sentiment\u2014people either getting ready to buy or sell. Right now, it mostly looks like more users are sending coins to each other, which keeps the network busy even when price sits still. Big Holders Step In Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large holders\u2014often called \u201cwhales\u201d\u2014are stocking up. Their coin inflows jumped by 145% over the last seven days, and by 214% over the past 30 days. When big players load up, it can tighten supply on exchanges. That makes it tougher for new buyers to get in without driving price higher. If whales keep buying at this rate, it could lead to more upward pressure on price once everyday investors step in again.

As of June 2, they held over 13 million BTC in total. When both big whales and these mid-level holders keep stacking, it further cuts down the number of coins floating on exchanges. Fewer coins available often mean any shift in demand could move price more. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "A provocative claim by crypto researcher \u201cDarkhorse\u201d has reignited debate over whether Ripple Labs is quietly sidestepping a federal court injunction through a newly disclosed $300 million XRP treasury vehicle involving Asia-based mobility firm Webus International Ltd. \u201cThis new treasury setup allows @Ripple to bypass the injunction legally and cleanly,\u201d Darkhorse declared in a post on X dated June 4. He contends that Ripple has found \u201cthe only route left by the Judge\u201d by using an institutional structure that moves XRP through regulated intermediaries instead of selling it directly to investors. \u201cIt\u2019s not just clever,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s compliant by design.\u201d The setup in question was revealed in a recent Form 6-K filing by Webus, which outlined the creation of an XRP Treasury to be managed by Samara Alpha, an SEC-registered investment adviser. The program delegates full control of up to $300 million in XRP to Samara under a phased, regulated structure. While the filing stops short of stating where the XRP will come from, Darkhorse argues the intent is clear: Ripple can legally sell XRP to an SEC-facing intermediary like Samara, which then allocates it to a corporate client like Webus \u2014 all without violating the standing injunction. Related Reading: The Worst Case For XRP This Cycle? Just A Giga Rally To $19, Says Analyst \u201cRipple is enjoined from direct institutional sales without SEC clearance,\u201d Darkhorse explained. \u201cThe workaround? Sell to regulated intermediaries (like Samara on behalf of Webus) with treasury agreements that are SEC-transparent and non-retail facing. It\u2019s structured \u2014 not casual.\u201d Is Ripple Bypassing The XRP Injunction? Veteran XRP commentator Jay Nisbett pushed back. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any of this as clever or bypassing anything \u2014 it\u2019s just adoption,\u201d he replied. Nisbett asserted that Ripple and Webus are not partners, that Webus is simply acquiring XRP like any other participant on the secondary market, and that the asset itself \u201chas been ruled to be not a security in this context.\u201d He added that holding XRP on a balance sheet isn\u2019t the same as triggering a securities transaction. Darkhorse issued a sharp rebuttal. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the mechanism,\u201d he told Nisbett, laying out his argument in four parts. First, he emphasized that Webus did not just announce an intent to buy on the open market. \u201cWebus filed via Form 6-K to publicly document a $300M XRP Treasury but not to simply buy on open markets. They delegated management to \u2018Samara Alpha,\u2019 an SEC-registered investment adviser, under a phased, regulated structure.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target Second, he argued that the core issue is Ripple\u2019s inability to sell directly to institutions, which is where the intermediary comes in. \u201cThis structure is about creating compliant distance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not Ripple handing XRP to an investor \u2014 it\u2019s routing via an SEC-registered manager who takes custody and executes under regulatory supervision.\u201d Third, Darkhorse disputed Nisbett\u2019s assertion that there\u2019s no relationship between Ripple and Webus. \u201cCheck RippleNet corridors and prior Asia-Pacific mobility pilot cases,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTheir ties to Ripple\u2019s network and XRPL liquidity routes go back years. Just because it wasn\u2019t front-page news doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Finally, he challenged the notion that Webus\u2019s XRP holdings are merely passive. \u201c \u2018Just holding on balance sheet\u2019 is not automatic exemption,\u201d he argued. \u201cThis is treasury deployment, not idle custody. The fact that Webus structured this through a delegated SEC-facing manager says they do consider XRP institutional risk a legal factor.\u201d He concluded bluntly: \u201cThis isn\u2019t Ripple dumping tokens on exchanges. It\u2019s creating institutional conduits that comply while navigating around the injunction bottleneck.\u201d Despite the detailed structure and SEC-facing components, Nisbett remained unmoved. \u201cNo I get what you\u2019re saying\u2026 I just disagree in that mechanism being an unexpected event,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s just a natural maturation of the market and the market reacting to legislation hurdles as the market always has and will.\u201d With Ripple still bound by Judge Torres\u2019s 2024 permanent injunction \u2014 which prohibits direct institutional XRP sales unless registered \u2014 the debate hinges on whether the Webus structure constitutes indirect circumvention or lawful evolution. The SEC has yet to comment, and the court recently denied the parties\u2019 request to vacate the injunction, calling it \u201cprocedurally improper.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.1989.

      "summary": "On-chain data shows the Solana network has just seen a large movement of dormant coins. Here&#8217;s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency. Solana Coin Days Destroyed Has Witnessed A Huge Spike In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) indicator for Solana. A &#8216;coin day&#8217; is a quantity that one token of the asset accumulates after having stayed dormant (that is, not being involved in any transaction activity) for one day. When a token carrying some number of coin days is moved, its coin days counter resets back to zero, and the coin days that it was carrying are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; The CDD measures the total number of coin days being reset in this manner across the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Key Investors Double Down, Buy Another 79,000 BTC When the value of this indicator registers a spike, it means dormant coins are potentially on the move. Generally, this kind of trend is a sign of transaction activity from the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs are resolute entities who tend to hold for long periods, so they naturally hold a large number of coin days. As such, transfers from them usually result in the destruction of a significant number of coin days. Now, here is the chart for the Solana CDD shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value during the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana CDD has observed a large spike recently, suggesting the LTHs have made some transactions. In total, this spike involved the destruction of a massive 3.55 billion coin days. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator has seen only two spikes of a greater scale in 2025 so far. February 26th recorded a CDD value of 5.53 billion, while March 3rd saw a value of 4.64 billion. The LTHs usually only break their silence when they want to participate in selling, so movements from them can sometimes spell trouble for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Large spikes like these can especially be worth taking note of, as they can point toward a possible shift in holder conviction . The aforementioned two larger spikes occurred one after the other, with a third, slightly smaller-scale spike following later in March. Therefore, it&#8217;s possible that more than a couple of diamond hands lost their belief during that period. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Fails To Hype Retail\u2014Demand Is Actually Down It now remains to be seen whether the latest Solana CDD spike would also be followed up by another, or if this was just a one-off event.
