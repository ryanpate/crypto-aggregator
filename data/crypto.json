The company behind Truth Social and Truth+ has asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to register a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, according to reports.

Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Truth Social Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF According to the registration statement dated June 16, the proposed ETF would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and the remaining 25% in Ethereum. If the SEC clears the way, the fund will list on NYSE Arca under a sponsor agreement with Yorkville America Digital. The plan is to store both coins in direct custody, meaning the ETF will actually hold the digital tokens rather than futures contracts or other derivatives. Crypto.com Handles Custody And Staking Based on reports, Crypto.com will serve as the ETF\u2019s sole custodian and prime execution agent.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-complete-right-shoulder-before-takeoff-how-low/",
      "summary": "XRP bulls appear to be facing one last test of conviction before the market\u2019s next explosive phase, according to CryptoInsightUK\u2019s video analysis released on 16 June. The British analyst argues that the token is sculpting an inverse head-and-shoulders formation whose right shoulder \u201cstill needs to form around the high-$1.80s\u201d before any sustained rally can commence. How Low Must XRP Go? In the broadcast, he emphasised that \u201cdense liquidity is below us,\u201d pointing to a confluence of resting bids and stop-loss clusters between roughly $1.92 and $1.80. \u201cI still think it comes down to make the right shoulder which is around 1.88,\u201d he said, adding that a swift wash-out into that pocket would \u201cflush the lows, tap in there and send it.\u201d At present, XRP is changing hands near $2.24, up about 3% over the past 24 hours, which implies a prospective drawdown of roughly 20% if the market fulfills his downside scenario. From the analyst\u2019s vantage point, such a retreat is less a cause for alarm than a prerequisite for the next major leg higher: \u201cIf we come down first, we\u2019ve done the downside part. Otherwise I\u2019m still going to be worried about going down even if we come up to $2.42 or higher.\u201d Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT\u2019s Volume? He linked the bearish short-term bias to structural forces beyond the XRP Ledger\u2019s ecosystem. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, has crept toward a historical inflection zone that previously triggered alt-seasons: \u201cAnywhere in this box could be the start of alt-season\u2026 That would probably coincide with Bitcoin dropping to between $100,000 and $93,000.\u201d A dominance spike fed by a late-cycle Bitcoin dip, he argued, would typically inflict outsized percentage losses on major altcoins\u2014including XRP\u2014before liquidity rotates back into them. Within XRP\u2019s own order book, CryptoInsightUK highlighted a \u201cliquidity vacuum\u201d created by May\u2019s capitulation candle. Although the token has since retraced most of that single-session collapse, he described the rebound as \u201cchoppy corrective price action,\u201d lacking the conviction and volume that accompanied earlier impulse waves. The right-shoulder flush, in his view, would neutralise residual leverage, particularly among traders who re-loaded longs too aggressively during the $2.15\u2013$2.40 bounce. How High Can XRP Explode? The inverse head-and-shoulders thesis also features prominently on his long-range chart, stretching back to mid-May. The analyst first published the pattern on X, showing a left shoulder near $2.42, a head at $1.47, and a neckline just above $2.50. Completing a symmetrical right shoulder near $1.88 would, by classical pattern-measuring rules, project an upside target above $3.50\u2014a level not visited since late-2021\u2019s cycle top. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP? Analyst Says $8 Breakout Is \u2018Just Waiting\u2019 Liquidity dynamics across the broader market reinforce his caution. Open interest in perpetual swaps for Ether, he observed, remains \u201cas high as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d suggesting that any sudden drop in majors could spark a forced-liquidation cascade across altcoin pairs. \u201cThese people will be flushed out,\u201d he warned, calling attention to negative-funding episodes that hint at an overcrowded short base waiting to be squeezed\u2014once the final downside pocket has been filled. Despite the near-term jitters, CryptoInsightUK reiterated a resolutely bullish macro stance. \u201cThe next stage I\u2019m most certain about is that we\u2019re going to go significantly higher for crypto,\u201d he told viewers. Drawing parallels with gold\u2019s record weekly close, he argued that an undercurrent of global risk aversion is quietly supporting non-sovereign stores of value, positioning both Bitcoin and XRP for accelerated appreciation once the technical reset concludes. For long-term holders, his advice was unequivocal: avoid wholesale portfolio shifts and instead treat any sub-$2.00 wick as a final accumulation window. \u201cDollar-cost averaging from here is a good thing to do,\u201d he said, revealing that 97% of his own capital remains in spot positions, with only a single-digit percentage reserved for surgical bids in the $1.80\u2013$1.92 zone. Whether XRP respects that script will become clear in the days ahead. Should the market indeed sweep into the high-$1.80s and rebound with the aggressive thrust the analyst expects, the right shoulder will be complete\u2014and the runway clear\u2014for the long-awaited take-off. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-crash-as-war-tensions/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price activity has been characterized by sharp swings as global uncertainties persist, particularly following the escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran. After plunging by nearly 5% amid the rising geopolitical strain, Bitcoin managed to recover, bouncing back above $105,000 and currently trading around $106,800. The past 24 hours have been highlighted by Bitcoin recovering toward $108,000 briefly again, but with escalating tensions in the Middle East, there&#8217;s a good chance it could crash soon. This aligns with an outlook from a crypto analyst, who noted that Bitcoin might crash toward $100,000. Resistance Band Faces Test For Bitcoin According to crypto analyst Pejman_Zwin on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is hovering within a confluence of resistance and short liquidation zones, stretching from $105,330 to $107,120. This range, he notes, is not only a structural resistance zone but also corresponds with the cumulative short liquidation leverage area. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions Basically, this means there&#8217;s a high possibility of an intensified price volatility if this zone is challenged or broken. The charts also reveal the presence of a possible contracting triangle pattern, which is a bearish continuation setup in the context of a larger correction. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $106,600 convincingly, the structure could shift from a corrective triangle to a five-wave downward impulse. This would cause a deeper retracement, especially as the price is already forming lower highs within the triangle. As such, the longer Bitcoin lingers in this resistance range without a breakout, the higher the likelihood of a rapid downward move. Bearish And Bull Targets If Bitcoin were to confirm this breakdown, the analyst noted the first major target around the lower boundary of the support zone, which lies between $105,330 and $103,162. This zone is reinforced by the monthly pivot point and also overlaps with the cumulative long liquidation leverage region. The 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart further highlighted a potential short setup from the reversal zone near $107,100 and a projected target close to $104,300. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Further downside could pull the price toward the next support band around $102,600 or even down to $101,000, should liquidation pressure persist. Pejman, on the other hand, pointed out that a sustained breakout above the $107,120 resistance line could initiate a bullish reversal and push Bitcoin back towards the heavy resistance cluster above $108,000. A strong daily close above $108,000 could cancel the bearish outlook. However, failure to break above here could lead to a rejection and another downside move. Although Bitcoin is starting to show some signs of bullishness, its price action is still vulnerable to a quick pullback, especially if the tensions in the Middle East continue to unfold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,638, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. This subdued price action shows its current consolidation nature.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-etf-is-next-last-chance-to-buy-solaxy/",
      "summary": "Here\u2019s a list of the people who think a Solana ETF is incoming: everyone. And here\u2019s a list of the people who think a $SOL ETF could send Solana \u2013 and Solaxy, a much-needed Solana Layer 2 \u2013 sky-high: also everyone. That\u2019s right, Solana is gaining serious momentum. Cantor Fitzgerald&#8217;s analysts report that Solana-focused firms DeFi Development, Upexi, and SOL Strategies will raise each raise $250M this year for various crypto-related efforts, including $SOL treasuries. Both the pending $SOL ETFs and current treasury efforts underscore SOL&#8217;s strengths: a unified, low\u2011cost, and high\u2011throughput blockchain that enables native staking yields and positions it as an attractive treasury asset. And how does this impact side projects like Solaxy, Solana&#8217;s first-ever Layer-2 chain? Let&#8217;s discuss below. Solana\u2019s TVL Climbs as ETFs Loom Solana\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) now exceeds $8B, and it maintains a vibrant developer base. Today&#8217;s treasury strategies are shifting accordingly, favoring scalable, productive blockchains alongside traditional reserve assets like Bitcoin. Simultaneously, CoinShares joined other financial heavyweights in filing for a spot Solana ETF, featuring staking components and third-party custody via Coinbase and BitGo. The filing aims to address SEC concerns about redemption and staking. While there\u2019s no timeline on the SEC\u2019s response and potential approval, analysts anticipate potential approvals in late summer or early fall 2025. It\u2019s worth noting that CoinShares\u2019s filing was one of 8 on the same day for new $SOL ETFs. Why the rush? In part because Solana is enjoying steadily growing adoption, despite relatively lackluster $SOL price performance. Strategy\u2019s Treasury Strategy Expands to Solana As the drumbeat of Michael Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin strategy goes on, companies beyond (Micro)Strategy are joining the bandwagon. After all, who doesn\u2019t want their very own pile of crypto? And in this case, companies are applying it to $SOL as well. DeFi Development Corp notified the SEC back in April that it intended to sell $1B in securities to purchase $SOL. SOL Strategies, based in Canada, did the same in late May. What does this mean for investors? At least three possibilities: \u2b06\ufe0f SOL could be moving into the mainstream, attracting attention as a yield-generating asset thanks to its staking model and institutional embrace. \u2705 Approval of spot $SOL ETFs would dramatically lower barriers to $SOL exposure through traditional brokerage venues. \ud83d\udccaContinued technological adoption and treasury-level interest could propel SOL further, though regulatory black swans and market volatility remain risks. Solana stands at a pivotal junction, even as $SOL treasuries take off and Solana meme coins continue to get attention. And the core Solana technical advantages \u2013 low fees, fast transactions \u2013 will get supercharged as Solaxy wraps up a dynamite presale. Solaxy ($SOLX) \u2013 $54M Raised as Time Runs Out for Groundbreak Layer-2 Presale $53.9M raised in its official presale \u2013 but with interest still sky-high, Solaxy ($SOLX) has opened a six-day window for investors to join the action. Solana loyalists and meme coin enthusiasts, drawn by Solaxy\u2019s potential as the first-ever Solana Layer 2, have added another $2M after the presale ended on Monday. That potential is taking shape with the Testnet Block Explorer and Bridge already live. The full launch schedule kicks in with the Token Claim on June 23, then builds out with a Mainnet Launch and bridge connecting Solana, Ethereum, and Solaxy. Multichain functionality is built into Solaxy from launch, with full Layer 2 deployment as the crowning achievement of a red-hot crypto presale. With Solana interest peaking at just the right time, how far could Solaxy go? Our own price prediction shows the token could reach $0.032, up 1,700% from its current $0.001766. What is Solaxy? It\u2019s the future of an already dynamic blockchain, combining Solana\u2019s speed and low costs with Ethereum\u2019s rock-solid framework and incredible ability to scale. Learn how to buy Solaxy, but don\u2019t delay \u2013 this truly is the last chance to buy. Visit the Solaxy Presale Page. Solana Climbs Adoption Ladder \u2013 Will Solaxy Price Follow? Curiously, Solana\u2019s price seems to lag its adoption. Even as institutions flock to $SOL treasuries and ETFs, the token price lags far behind $BTC\u2019s impressive performance. Will Solaxy\u2019s Layer 2 send both $SOLX and $SOL surging? Do your own research. This isn\u2019t financial advice \u2013 crypto markets are always volatile."

      "summary": "According to Digital Ascension Group\u2019s Managing Director Jake Claver, XRP could reach a price level that brings a dramatic shift in how value moves on its network. He argues that higher token prices make the system more efficient. Claver even lays out a bold target of $10,000 per XRP, and he says that can happen within 24 months. The idea has reignited talk of crypto\u2019s next big rally. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Price And Liquidity Efficiency According to Claver, moving large sums on the XRP ledger depends on token price. At $1 per XRP, you need 1,000,000 tokens to shift $1 million. If the price rose to $10, only 100,000 tokens would do the job. And in a world where one XRP costs $1 million, a single token could cover that same $1 million transfer. This math shows why Claver believes price and network efficiency go hand in hand. Does XRP need to be a certain price to move large amounts of money? pic.twitter.com/tbqBbvST4y \u2014 Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 27, 2025 Market Cap Implications XRP trades near $2.24 today, with a market cap of about $131.7 billion. At $10,000 per token, that cap would swell to over $585 trillion. Claver treats that huge number as a sign of strength rather than a warning. He says market cap rules don\u2019t apply the same way to XRP. But critics point out you can\u2019t assume that every token sits ready to trade. Actual liquidity comes from orders on exchanges and funds in liquidity pools, not just a headline market cap. Timeline And Skepticism Claver doesn\u2019t shy away from timing. He told his followers that the $10,000 mark could arrive within 24 months. Some hear that as a call to buy now. Others see it as wildly optimistic. To reach that level, XRP would need to climb more than 500,000% from today\u2019s price. Even Bitcoin, with far more adoption, took about four years to go from $1,200 to $68,000 in the last cycle. Cranking out a similar or bigger gain in half the time would require huge new demand. Community Reaction And Risks Based on reports, Claver\u2019s claim has attracted both cheers and jeers. Some XRP fans embrace the vision. Others worry it sets unrealistic hopes.
