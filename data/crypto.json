      "summary": "What does crypto want to be when it grows up? Centralized exchanges like Coinbase have long marketed themselves as crypto&#8217;s answer to convenience. User-friendly, regulated, and custodial. Just give them the keys and let them drive. They&#8217;ll handle all the boring details \u2013 like on/off ramps, UI, integrated swapping, and little things like taking control of your crypto. And in return, all you need to do is trust. But increasingly, that deal sounds like a bad one. The trade-off between trust and control is no longer worth it. Trust Coinbase and other custodial platforms too much, and what do you get? Hacks and data breaches, among other things. There\u2019s a better path forward \u2013 and more and more crypto users are looking for it. A Better Custody Deal So, what should the future of crypto be? Crypto should still be easy. It should still be intuitive. But it should also be private, safe, secure, and truly self-custodial. After all, the old adage of \u2018not your keys, not your crypto\u2019 shouldn&#8217;t just be a slogan \u2013 it is, and should be, the foundation of decentralized finance. That&#8217;s where wallets like Best Wallet come in. Unlike centralized platforms, self-custody crypto wallets like Best Wallet don&#8217;t hold your private keys. You have complete control of your assets at all times. There are no middlemen, no single points of failure, and no need to put your trust in third parties. But what about the convenience of swapping crypto, sending crypto, and exploring new crypto opportunities all from one app? Bridging the Gap: Self-Custody Meets Convenience The future of crypto points to tools that combine the convenience of centralized exchanges like Coinbase, including KYC and AML requirements, with the security of self-custody, without sacrificing usability. We&#8217;ve already seen this with tools like Railgun, which complies with KYC while enabling private transactions on DeFi platforms, and which Vitalik Buterin just used to transfer $2.6M in crypto. While transactions of that size may well be just another day in the office for the Ethereum founder, it demonstrates how increasingly important privacy, control, and functionality are in the developing crypto economy. This is nothing new; it&#8217;s often the people most deeply involved in tech who understand just how important it is to control your own data (and your own crypto). Remember Zuckerberg\u2019s camera? That was the time he was promoting Meta, and everyone realized he&#8217;d taped across his laptop&#8217;s microphone and camera. Was that paranoia or an understanding of just how vulnerable our data is? That&#8217;s the balance that Best Wallet wants to deliver, beating MetaMask at its own game and dominating the Web3 self-custody wallet market. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 The Self-Custody Crypto Wallet Presale Token Crypto wallets aren\u2019t just handy places to stash some spare Bitcoin, at least not anymore. The best crypto wallets \u2013 like Best Wallet \u2013 serve as all-in-one control hubs for crypto investors, whether you&#8217;re operating multiple wallets, swapping tokens, ot investing in crypto presales. And that&#8217;s not all. The Best Wallet ecosystem is supercharged by its own token, $BEST. Best Wallet Token holders get: Lower transaction fees Higher staking rewards Earlier presale access Eligibility for bonus crypto airdrops (such as BTC Bull Token\u2019s Bitcoin airdrop) Best Wallet and the $BEST token are building the crypto future that Buterin and others are looking for: interconnected, seamless, and self-custodial. It&#8217;s everything you could want or ever need from a crypto wallet. You can manage your portfolio, browse upcoming token launches (including the best new meme coins), and spend your crypto in real life with the upcoming Best Card. Buying, selling, and swapping are as easy as tapping a few buttons. And all this is secured with multi-party computation (MPC) and biometric authentication to keep your crypto safe without sacrificing ease of use. The Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $13.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.025135. That could rise to $0.035215 by the end of the year, according to our $BEST price prediction, delivering gains of 40% to current presale investors. Learn more about how to buy Best Wallet Token with our guide. Best Wallet: Building the Self-Custodial Future of Crypto No longer does crypto have to choose between usability and control. Tools like Best Wallet are showing that self-custody platforms can match \u2013 or even beat \u2013 the convenience that centralized exchanges offer while staying true to the core values of crypto. As more self-custodial models appear in a post-Coinbase world, Best Wallet wants to lead the charge and dominate this $11B sector. If it succeeds, it will be by delivering a product that is convenient and completely crypto-native. Always do your own research before investing in crypto; this isn\u2019t financial advice. Crypto self-custody is the future. Best Wallet is helping to build that future."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-to-10000-2/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price is falling fast, and with bears currently taking control, a crypto analyst has forecasted an impending crash below $100,000. While this potential downturn may sound alarming, the analyst has also revealed that after the pullback, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to undergo a significant price rally to new all-time highs. Bitcoin Price Faces Immediate Crash Risk Bitcoin appears to be entering a cooling phase after experiencing a significant bullish run that spanned several weeks and led to its current all-time high of almost $112,000. \u2018MelikaTrader94\u2019, the TradingView crypto analyst responsible for this new technical analysis, predicts that during this cooling period, bears could take over and send the Bitcoin price crashing down to former lows under $100,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings On a 4-hour chart presented by the analyst, Bitcoin has consistently respected a descending trendline acting as a strong resistance threshold. This line, which formed after the recent peak, has now rejected price action multiple times, preventing further upward movement and hinting at growing bearish pressure in the short term. At the time of the analysis, Bitcoin was trading at $106,432, attempting to test the descending trendline once again. However, the chart shows that BTC lacks strong momentum, suggesting that another rejection is likely. If this rejection occurs, BTC\u2019s price action is expected to correct downward toward the $99,000 region, marked on the chart as a key horizontal support zone. Bitcoin\u2019s projected pullback is consistent with typical market behavior, especially after an extended bullish phase. Based on the TradingView expert\u2019s analysis, a drop to the $99,000 support level could shake out weak hands and provide fresh buy-dip opportunities for traders. While the structure of the projected downward move is not entirely bearish, it suggests a necessary retest of lower support areas before any sustainable rally can resume. Bullish Continuation Expected After Pullback MelikaTrader94 has suggested that correcting down to the $99,000 support zone is critical for determining Bitcoin\u2019s next rally. If this crash successfully occurs and buyers step in to defend the support, BTC could begin forming a strong bullish continuation structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch The TradingView analyst\u2019s chart outlines a possible rebound from the support area, which could trigger a breakout above the descending trendline. A sustained move above this trendline would potentially invalidate the short-term bearish structure and set the stage for a new all-time high, with price targets extending beyond $114,000. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s consolidation around its current price of $104,500, followed by a possible dip to the well-established support zone, fits the analyst\u2019s narrative that the market is preparing for a big move. The TradingView expert has urged investors and traders to keep an eye out for a strong bounce, as this projected pullback could be a healthy one that comes just before a bullish leg up.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-mirrors-bitcoin-2020-breakout-setup-historic-run-incoming/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading at critical levels after breaking past the $2,500 mark earlier this quarter, now attempting to reclaim momentum and push into higher resistance. Despite global macroeconomic pressures\u2014including rising US Treasury yields and persistent trade tensions between the US and China\u2014ETH continues to show resilience. Market analysts believe that Ethereum could be leading the charge into a long-anticipated altseason, provided it holds key levels and breaks above current supply. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target \u2013 Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? Top analyst Ted Pillows recently pointed to a compelling technical pattern: Ethereum has now posted four consecutive two-week green candles, a formation that mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s price structure in early 2020 following the March crash. That period marked the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s legendary bull run to $69,000. According to Pillows, the similarities between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025 are \u201cjust mind blowing,\u201d sparking renewed interest from traders who see Ethereum\u2019s current consolidation as a bullish continuation. With investor sentiment slowly recovering and technicals turning favorable, the market is watching ETH closely. If history is any guide, this consolidation could mark the calm before Ethereum\u2019s next major leg higher. However, macro risks still linger, and timing will be critical. Ethereum Resilience Sparks Hopes Of 2020-Like Rally Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,600 level, showing resilience amid global macro uncertainty and volatile market conditions. This consolidation around key support has many investors and analysts anticipating a breakout that could lead Ethereum into a new rally phase, potentially triggering a broader altseason. Despite growing concerns around systemic risk in the bond market and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, Ethereum continues to attract buyers, signaling confidence in its long-term strength. Analysts are watching this range closely. Many believe that if Ethereum can maintain support and break above near-term resistance, it could gain serious momentum. One of the more compelling arguments for a bullish outlook comes from Ted Pillows, who highlights a striking similarity between Ethereum\u2019s current structure and Bitcoin\u2019s behavior in 2020. According to Pillows, Ethereum has now printed four consecutive two-week green candles since bottoming, just as Bitcoin did after the March 2020 crash. That pattern marked the start of BTC\u2019s legendary run to $69,000. The comparison has sparked optimism that ETH may be preparing for a similar breakout, especially if it clears resistance near $2,700\u2013$2,800. While the macro environment remains tense, this technical structure\u2014paired with rising confidence in ETH\u2019s strength\u2014keeps bulls hopeful that a major move is on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC \u2013 Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Consolidation Above Support Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,607, consolidating just above the 34-period EMA on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near $2,594. After the strong surge in early May that saw ETH rally from under $2,000 to highs near $2,850, the price has moved into a tight consolidation range. This sideways action reflects market indecision as buyers and sellers battle for control. Despite the recent volatility, ETH has continued to post higher lows, indicating ongoing bullish pressure. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are aligned below the current price, all trending upward, signaling that the broader trend remains intact. The price is finding consistent support from the 50-period SMA around the $2,590\u2013$2,600 zone, which is a key level to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty \u2013 Analyst A decisive break above the short-term resistance near $2,680 would be needed to confirm continuation toward $2,800 and potentially retest previous highs. On the downside, a break below $2,590 could trigger a pullback toward $2,500 or lower, especially if BTC shows weakness. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-needs-0-40-breakout-salvage-bull-case/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s six-month slide may be about to reach its moment of truth, according to independent market commentator VisionPulsed, who told followers on June 4 that the memecoin must vault the long-standing ceiling at roughly $0.40 \u201ceither this week or next\u201d if the broader bullish structure is to survive the summer. In a video analysis, the analyst pointed to a second consecutive \u201cblue bar\u201d flashing on Ethereum\u2019s momentum oscillator, a signal he treats as a reliable harbinger of imminent, high-magnitude moves across the digital-asset complex. \u201cThe last time we had two blue bars on Ethereum was way back when we were still young and optimistic,\u201d he said, invoking memories of August 2023. \u201cWe printed five that time and the market moved sixteen percent. We\u2019re at two now; by Sunday we\u2019ll probably have four, which tells me the move should come next week.\u201d Dogecoin Needs June Rally To Avert Summer Slump Although the blue-bar framework is native to Ethereum, VisionPulsed argued that its read-through for Bitcoin and, by correlation, Dogecoin is more important than ever. He noted that Bitcoin\u2019s own hash-ribbon metric\u2014formed when the network\u2019s 30-day and 60-day hash-rate moving averages compress\u2014has followed a strictly \u201csell for two weeks, then rally\u201d pattern through the current cycle. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been selling off for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically in this bull market, that\u2019s when Bitcoin resets and moves higher. If that plays out again, Dogecoin should finally get the lift it\u2019s been denied since February.\u201d Related Reading: June Or Doom: Dogecoin Faces 6 Red Months If It Fails To Surge, Predicts Analyst The crux of his thesis sits on a 70-day timing model derived from Dogecoin\u2019s prior impulse lows. Measuring from the most recent trough, the 70-day mark falls on 14 June. \u201cEvery major upswing in Dogecoin during this cycle has come 60 to 80 days after a bottom,\u201d he explained, scrolling through historical candles on screen. \u201cWe\u2019re right on that window\u2014if we\u2019re going to break higher, it almost has to be now.\u201d VisionPulsed acknowledged his own track record of slipping deadlines\u2014\u201cone for five hundred,\u201d he joked\u2014but insisted the structure remains statistically sound. \u201cIf we don\u2019t rally next week, I\u2019m never putting dates on anything again,\u201d he told viewers, before adding a caveat that has become the headline takeaway. \u201cDogecoin has to clear $0.40. If we can\u2019t do that, the bear case strengthens dramatically: June down, July probably down, September seasonally weak, and suddenly you\u2019re talking eight red months out of nine.\u201d Pressed by commenters about the depth of a potential downside scenario, the analyst pointed to Ethereum for context. A bullish resolution, he said, could lift ETH to roughly $3,200 before a summer consolidation and possibly $4,200 by early autumn, a path that in his view would drag Dogecoin well north of the $0.40 trigger. Failure, however, \u201csets up a very large move down, maybe sub-$2,000 on ETH,\u201d a slide that would likely leave Dogecoin retesting multi-month lows. \u201cWhichever way we go,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis going to determine the rest of the summer.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The urgency is aggravated by Dogecoin\u2019s mounting sequence of monthly losses: five red candles since January, with only a brief reprieve in April. \u201cSix red months out of seven is staring us in the face,\u201d VisionPulsed said. \u201cJune doesn\u2019t have to be a vertical move, but it does have to be green\u2014or at least show a decisive breakout\u2014because otherwise, where is the bull run?\u201d Market structure rather than sentiment, he stressed, underpins the call. Bitcoin already sits near cycle highs while Dogecoin still trades markedly below its own year-to-date peak, a divergence he interprets as latent leverage. \u201cIf Bitcoin punches through its local top, it typically drags Doge,\u201d he said, referencing earlier intervals in 2024 when BTC strength eventually translated into delayed but exaggerated moves in the memecoin. Whether that historical choreography can repeat depends, in his framework, on the next few daily closes. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely getting more energy built up,\u201d he said, pointing to narrowing Bollinger Bands and declining on-chain activity. \u201cI don\u2019t think the large move is here yet, but by late this week\u2014or early next week at the latest\u2014you should get your answer.\u201d For traders who still believe the four-year cycle remains intact, the analyst\u2019s $0.40 line in the sand arrives almost exactly one calendar year before the next projected Bitcoin top in October 2026. \u201cIf Doge can\u2019t start moving now, the entire timing model gets pushed off course,\u201d he warned. \u201cI genuinely think June is a make-or-break month.\u201d At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

If coins are locked away, traders have to compete for a smaller pool of available coins. That gap between supply and demand can cause bigger price swings on the upside. Institutions And State Moves Three US states have now passed laws to hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves. New Hampshire already signed its bill into law. Texas is expected to follow soon. A third state is also moving forward, though details are still pending. In addition, governments abroad are paying attention. Pakistan\u2019s government has said it will look into Bitcoin reserves. In the UK, the Reform Party\u2014currently leading in election polls\u2014plans to study something similar. When a state or country actually buys Bitcoin for its coffers, it can spark more buying. That act has a double effect: it creates immediate demand and it signals that public institutions see Bitcoin as a store of value. Safe-Haven Status Strengthens Rising uncertainty over the US dollar and US debt worries have driven some investors toward Bitcoin. In May, as US Treasury prices slid on concerns about rising debt levels, digital gold and physical gold saw higher interest. Bitcoin is being viewed more like a hedge against dollar weakness. On days when Treasuries wobble, some cash moves into crypto markets. Larger swings on the upside than on the downside also hint that institutions may be soaking up dips more quickly. Sygnum\u2019s data shows that since June 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s upward moves have been larger than its downward moves. That may be a sign that big players have become more confident in holding through small sell-offs. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Ethereum\u2019s Comeback Ethereum is also stirring after a period of sluggish performance. The recent Pectra upgrade on Ethereum has spurred more fees and drawing fresh interest. Several big banks and financial firms are now exploring tokenization platforms built on Ethereum and its layer-2 networks. When more institutions issue tokenized assets, the whole crypto space could benefit. Renewed activity on Ethereum often spills back into Bitcoin. That could add to overall demand for top coins.
