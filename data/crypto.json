      "summary": "Cardano has slipped about 1.54% in the past day, but signs are pointing toward a turn in its fortunes. Traders have spotted a rare weekly golden cross on the ADA/USD chart. That happens when a shorter moving average crosses above a longer one. It can signal that buyers are gaining the upper hand after months of sideways action. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In First Ever Weekly Golden Cross According to analyst Mr. Brownstone, Cardano just logged its first\u2011ever weekly golden cross, with the 50\u2011week moving average climbing above the 200\u2011week line. ADA is trading at $0.60, under both its 50\u2011day MA at $0.66 and its 200\u2011day MA at $0.64. That gap means bulls need more firepower to push price back above key levels. Still, the weekly signal has many calling a bullish move ahead. Anyone else notice that Cardano just had it&#8217;s first Weekly Golden Cross ever? \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/d7gvWQfN1Z \u2014 Mr Brownstone (@GunsRoses1987) July 9, 2025 Price Levels To Watch Based on examination from MasterAnanda, ADA will likely need to reclaim its 34\u2011period EMA and the 200\u2011day MA before a real uptrend can take hold. Many traders use those levels as checkpoints. If ADA closes above $0.64, it could draw new buyers in. On the flip side, a drop under $0.59 might trigger more selling pressure. Whales Return To Accumulate Analyst Ali Martinez has noted that large holders scooped up about 120 million ADA over the past two weeks. These addresses, each holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA, now control roughly 5.5 billion ADA\u2014worth around $3.3 billion at current prices. When big wallets pile in, it often suggests confidence that prices will head higher. But it can also lead to quick flips if whales decide to take profits.

Some analysts expect ADA to climb to $1.33, while others think $10 is within reach this cycle. Price prediction by CoinCodex points to a 25% rise to $0.74 by August 8, 2025. Right now, technical indicators lean bearish, and the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 59 (Neutral). Cardano has seen 14 out of the last 30 days end in green, with volatility around 7.54%, according to the price prediction site. Related Reading: 2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands \u2014 But Who Is He? Outlook And Next Steps Cardano\u2019s weekly golden cross is a bullish sign, but price still needs to clear shorter\u2011term hurdles. Traders looking for confirmation may wait for ADA to close above $0.66 on the daily chart. Those already in position might set a stop\u2011loss below $0.59 to guard against a rejection. With whale activity back on the rise and long\u2011term targets ranging from $1.33 to $10, Cardano is once again on investors\u2019 radar. However, broader market trends\u2014especially moves in Bitcoin\u2014will likely dictate whether ADA\u2019s momentum can stick. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-30-day-average-funding-rate-drops-bullish-setup-takes-shape/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin continues to consolidate just below its all-time high of $112K, holding firmly above key support at $105K despite repeated bearish attempts to push the price lower. This tight trading range reflects market uncertainty, yet the structure favors bulls as long as support levels remain intact. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support \u2013 Momentum Builds For Range Breakout Meanwhile, macroeconomic conditions are evolving rapidly. The US Congress recently passed President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d economic package ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline, signaling a new phase of fiscal stimulus marked by tax cuts and aggressive spending. Combined with strong job reports, these factors suggest inflation may soon accelerate \u2014 a trend that historically supports Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat devaluation. On the market sentiment side, funding rates provide a crucial clue. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the 30-day average of Bitcoin perpetual funding rates is currently very low. This reflects a lack of excessive greed and typically marks a favorable setup for bullish continuation. Historically, periods of low funding rates have preceded major upward moves, especially when paired with strong macro tailwinds. With economic pressure building and Bitcoin still in a bullish structure, the coming days could define the next major move for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. Calm Before The Breakout: Bitcoin Gains Strength Above $107K Bitcoin is up more than 3% since the start of July, holding firmly above the $107,000 local low despite repeated resistance at the $110,000 level. This sustained strength signals underlying buyer support and growing momentum as BTC continues to consolidate just below all-time highs. The $110K resistance remains a critical ceiling \u2014 once breached, analysts expect a strong move into price discovery as bullish momentum builds. So far, the market has digested a wave of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Global trade dynamics \u2014 including rising tariffs, export restrictions, and deglobalization trends \u2014 continue to shape sentiment. Yet, compared to the sharp volatility seen earlier this year, both Bitcoin and US equities appear more resilient. This suggests that much of the uncertainty has already been priced in, reducing the downside risk for risk assets like BTC. A key technical factor reinforcing the bullish case is the low 30-day average of funding rates. This indicator reflects a neutral-to-cautiously optimistic market environment \u2014 a stark contrast to overheated bullish phases that often precede corrections. Calm periods like this often set the stage for explosive moves, particularly when supply squeezes and strong demand meet a macro environment ripe for risk-taking. With BTC coiling tightly and sentiment balanced, a breakout could be imminent. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B \u2013 Liquidity On The Rise BTC Holds Steady as Bulls Eye $109,300 Breakout The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin (BTC) consolidating within a tight range, holding above the key support at $107,000 and testing resistance around $109,300. This price level has consistently acted as a local ceiling, with several failed breakout attempts in late June and early July. However, the bulls continue to defend higher lows, signaling strength and setting the stage for a potential breakout. The 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) are stacked close together and gradually trending upward, suggesting the consolidation phase could soon transition into a more directional move. Volume remains low, which often precedes a volatility spike, especially near key resistance levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical The $103,600 support remains the crucial line in the sand for bulls. A breakdown below that level would invalidate the short-term bullish structure and likely lead to a deeper retrace. On the upside, a daily close above $109,300 with volume confirmation could trigger a rally toward price discovery above the all-time high. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
