Over the past week, BTC has displayed relative price stability, with modest bullish movement at intervals. The cryptocurrency continued to trade within a tight range for most of the week, mirroring a mix of optimism and caution amongst market participants.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-elon-musk-reshape-crypto-dex-twitter-x/",
      "summary": "Elon Musk is reportedly planning to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) on X (formerly Twitter). Crypto researcher Atlas took to X to break the news, pointing out that this move could result in the introduction of hundreds of millions of users to crypto. Keep reading to learn more about Musk&#8217;s DEX plans, what it means for crypto, and how investing in the best altcoins could help you make the most of it. Musk&#8217;s Boldest Finance Move Yet A native DEX on Twitter will transform the platform into an &#8216;everything app,&#8217; which Elon Musk has gone on record to say was his goal. Another reason to believe that we could soon see X turning into a full-blown financial ecosystem is Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, who recently confirmed that in-app tipping, payments, and investing are already in the pipeline. For X users, this could mean enhanced financial privacy, total control over their funds, and lower transaction fees, as well as the ability to trade stablecoins, $BTC, $ETH, and other tokenized assets directly from within the X app. Although Musk hasn&#8217;t officially confirmed the decentralized exchange, users have spotted a GitHub code snippet on X that suggests a DEX is already in the works. What This Means for Crypto &#38; Altcoins? Integrating a DEX into X (a platform with 650M active monthly users) will crank up crypto&#8217;s visibility and mainstream adoption. It will eliminate the need to maintain third-party crypto apps and wallets, making it easier for the average person to interact with crypto. As folks get comfortable with the idea of dealing in altcoins, they&#8217;d naturally understand the potential of investing in these tokens. This will further drive up their popularity and trading volume. Also, let&#8217;s not forget Musk&#8217;s crypto effect. Just a couple of weeks back, he uploaded a clip from a video game where his character was named Kekius Maximus. As a result, $KEKIUS tokens soared almost instantly. So, if Musk&#8217;s DEX supports or even mentions specific tokens, those could very easily emerge as the top trending cryptos. With that in mind, here are the best cryptos to buy now to benefit from the hype around a revolutionary X DEX. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Best Altcoin to Buy Now, A New Feature-Packed Trading Bot Snorter Token ($SNORT) could be the next crypto to explode thanks to its one-of-a-kind Telegram trading bot that comes with advanced tools, tight security, and a top-notch user experience. Snorter&#8217;s biggest selling point is its ability to swipe liquidity in new meme coins. In our experience, doing so manually, i.e., without Snorter Bot, would be nearly impossible because institutional crypto investors eat up all the liquidity in new tokens using advanced tools. By allowing you to buy meme cryptos as soon as they&#8217;re listed, Snorter gives you the opportunity to make huge gains that are generally associated with price jumps in freshly listed altcoins. Additionally, $SNORT token holders will benefit from reduced trading fees: just 0.85%, which is noticeably lower than the industry standard of 1%. Snorter Bot is a force to reckon with in terms of security, too. From routing your swaps through a private Solana RPC infrastructure to using MEV-resistant relays and other techniques to protect you against sandwich attacks, honeypots, and scams, it&#8217;s a complete package. Buy Snorter Token now for just $0.0961 each. The project is currently in presale, and it has raised over $1.16M. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 Top New Altcoin Powering the Best Wallet Ecosystem Speaking of crypto apps that could revolutionize the DeFi space, Best Wallet is a free crypto wallet offering a secure and seamless user experience, as well as the ability to buy new meme coins on presale directly from within the app. Powered by the Best Wallet Token ($BEST), Best Wallet is self-custodial. This simply means that it doesn&#8217;t belong to any company or crypto exchange, so no one has access to your crypto except you. Other security measures include advanced cryptographic techniques (Fireblock\u2019s MPC-CMP wallet technology) and two-factor authentication/biometrics for app login. Best Wallet aims to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% and reach a valuation of $1.5B in the next few years, by 2026. You can make the most of Best Wallet&#8217;s growth trajectory by buying $BEST, the token that powers its ecosystem. It&#8217;s currently available for just $0.025215, with the presale having raised over $13.4M so far. 3. XRP ($XRP) \u2013 Big-Name Crypto Teasing a Breakout XRP, the fourth biggest crypto in terms of market capitalization, has been in a massive consolidation zone for the past few months. Expert traders (such as Crypto Beast on X) believe that a breakout of this zone could see the token explode 300% and reach $8. $XRP is currently trading around $2.11. A huge reason for this bullish bias is the recent approval of a spot XRP ETF by Canada&#8217;s Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). It will soon be launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Also, approximately 2,700 whales now hold more than 1M $XRP, which is the highest ever. And XRP&#8217;s active addresses have also increased to 295K per day, as compared to 35K-40K in the previous few months. Bottom Line With Elon Musk planning to blur the lines between finance and communication by building a decentralized exchange (DEX) on X, we could see an unprecedented number of users entering Web3 and decentralized finance. Naturally, this could result in a spike in interest in high-potential tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST), which could lead the next altcoin rally. That said, bear in mind that crypto investments are risky because of the market&#8217;s volatility and uncertainty. This article isn&#8217;t financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing."

Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits\u2014Analyst Reveals Key Insight Historical RSI Breakouts Could Signal New Push According to the charts shared by Moustache, Bitcoin\u2019s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) tends to surge into overbought territory just before major rallies. Back in July 2013, Bitcoin sat at $66, then jumped to nearly $1,120 by November as the RSI hit high levels. A similar spike happened in May 2017, when BTC rose from about $1,300 to $19,700 by December. On April 1, 2021, Bitcoin reached $64,800 while the RSI again climbed beyond its usual range. In 2024, those RSI peaks came on March 1 at $73,800 and again in November when it cleared $100,000. #Bitcoin$BTC monthly RSI is so close to entering overbought territory.

Over the last 10 days, wallets with at least 10 BTC rose by 231 addresses. At the same time, retail wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC fell by 37,460 addresses.

In past runs, Bitcoin often paused or pulled back for days or even weeks before the real rally got underway. Sometimes the RSI stayed elevated while prices drifted sideways. In 2017, for example, a correction followed the high RSI but the broader uptrend kept going. Today\u2019s RSI is near those same levels\u2014and could linger there for a while.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/if-bitcoin-hits-92800/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price crashed from as high as $106,000 to $102,000 on June 20, sparking sell-offs among investors. Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn\u2019t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC\u2019s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. Bulls Need To Step In For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-charts-signal-potential-bottom-all-eyes-on-next-move/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is once again trading at critical demand levels, testing the lower boundary of a six-week range that began forming in early May. After briefly climbing toward $2,800 earlier this month, ETH has retraced back to the $2,400 zone, reigniting debate about whether this is a healthy consolidation or a sign of further downside to come. Despite the pressure, Ethereum has not broken below this range, signaling that buyers continue to step in at these levels. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels \u2013 Here\u2019s Why This extended consolidation period suggests a decisive move is nearing. Breakouts from tight ranges like this one often lead to strong directional momentum, and ETH\u2019s current price structure could act as a launchpad\u2014if bulls regain control. According to top analyst M-log1, Ethereum may have already bottomed during its most recent retrace, with the current action reflecting accumulation rather than weakness. The ETH/BTC ratio, another critical chart watched by traders, is also hovering near support levels, implying that a rotation back into altcoins may be imminent if Ethereum holds or pushes higher. For now, the market watches closely, as ETH\u2019s next move could set the tone for broader altcoin performance in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Holds Range As Market Awaits Decisive Break Ethereum continues to trade within a tight consolidation range that began in early May, showing resilience despite growing global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. The price has hovered between $2,360 and $2,700, forming a narrow channel as buyers and sellers remain locked in a standoff. With conflicts in the Middle East intensifying and financial markets reacting to high interest rates and rising Treasury yields, crypto assets are under pressure, and Ethereum is no exception. The long-anticipated altseason has yet to materialize, and Ethereum is widely seen as the key to unlocking that next phase. ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract and DeFi space gives it a central role in leading altcoin market momentum. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring its current range, especially after M-log1 shared analysis suggesting the recent low at $2,360 could mark a local bottom. According to M-log1, Ethereum is now consolidating just below the $2,450 level, and this zone could serve as a bullish trigger if reclaimed with strength. A decisive move in either direction will likely set the tone for the broader crypto market, with a breakout above $2,500 potentially igniting the next leg upward. Until then, market participants are watching closely. If ETH fails to hold these demand levels, the range could break to the downside, delaying any altseason rally further. But if bulls regain control and push above key resistance, it could signal the start of a much-anticipated upward move. In this environment of uncertainty, Ethereum\u2019s next breakout-or breakdown\u2014could prove pivotal for market sentiment heading into the second half of the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Key Support As Price Retraces Ethereum is currently trading at $2,405, down 4.17% in the last session, after testing a low of $2,367. The chart reveals that ETH has retraced back to the lower boundary of a six-week range, confirming strong demand in the $2,360\u2013$2,400 area. This zone has acted as a critical support level multiple times, with bulls stepping in each time to defend it. The price remains trapped below the 200-day moving average ($2,774), which has proven to be a strong resistance. Meanwhile, both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are trending below price, currently sitting at $2,287 and $2,640, respectively, tightening the range even more. This compression typically leads to high volatility once a breakout occurs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern \u2013 $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Volume has remained elevated during recent sessions, suggesting that buyers and sellers are actively competing for control. A decisive close below $2,360 could trigger a cascade toward $2,100 or lower. Conversely, if bulls manage to reclaim $2,500 and sustain momentum toward the $2,700\u2013$2,800 resistance band, it may set the stage for a breakout.
