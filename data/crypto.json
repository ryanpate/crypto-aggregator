Cardano Price Dips Again In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline below the $0.580, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA even declined below the $0.5750 level to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5102 swing low to the $0.5938 high. The price even spiked below the $0.5520 support. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.570 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading below $0.570 and the 100-hourly simple moving average.

If there is a close above the $0.5920 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.620 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.6350 in the near term. Another Drop In ADA? If Cardano\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.5850 resistance level, it could start another decline.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-net-taker-volume-spikes-as-billions-exit-derivatives/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has regained some upward momentum, with its market price currently hovering around $107,155 at the time of writing. This marks a 0.4% decrease in the past 24 hours, and a 4.3% drop below its all-time high of $111,000, set in May. Despite the rebound, analysts are closely watching for potential shifts in momentum as a number of market indicators and macroeconomic signals suggest a more cautious short-term outlook. Among the recent developments drawing attention is a sharp rise in Net Taker Volume on Binance, along with significant stablecoin outflows from derivative platforms. CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha noted in a recent market commentary that these changes could indicate increased speculative activity. While some traders interpret such surges as bullish signals, they often occur due to short liquidations or sudden retail buying rather than consistent organic demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment Derivatives Activity and Fed Commentary Fuel Market Caution On June 24, Binance\u2019s Net Taker Volume crossed $100 million for the first time since early June. This level of activity, according to Taha, can sometimes signal buying momentum but may also point to forced closures of short positions, especially in high-leverage environments. Taha emphasized that without strong capital inflows to back the movement, these bursts tend to be short-lived. Simultaneously, more than $1.25 billion in stablecoin liquidity has exited derivative exchanges, marking the largest capital outflow from these platforms since May. These outflows reduce the base for opening new leveraged positions, potentially dampening future market momentum. Taha also pointed to external economic cues, particularly a recent statement by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. During his testimony before Congress, Powell signaled that rate cuts may be on the table depending on upcoming economic conditions. While looser monetary policy is often viewed as favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin, the shift also reflects underlying uncertainty. The analyst also mentioned that the Swiss Franc, traditionally seen as a safe-haven currency, has also surged against the US dollar, suggesting that some investors are leaning risk-off amid broader macroeconomic developments. Market Structure Remains Firm, But Momentum Is Slowing Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Dan offered a different perspective using a bubble chart model that visualizes trading volume trends across exchanges. According to Dan, Bitcoin is currently experiencing a \u201ccooling\u201d phase. This implies reduced trading activity without dramatic spikes in volume, often seen as a sign that the market is consolidating rather than overheating.

      "summary": "US President Donald Trump\u2019s namesake meme token has tumbled hard, slumping nearly 90% from its all-time high set six months ago. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin\u2019s $107K Push Today, TRUMP is trading at $8.80, down 6% in the last seven days. Traders are on edge after the project\u2019s team yanked $4.4 million in USDC from liquidity pools and a single whale lined up a $2.5 million sell order. Team Pulls Millions From Liquidity According to a recent post on X by Lookonchain, the Trump Coin team withdrew $4.4 million worth of USDC and moved 347,438 TRUMP tokens\u2014valued at $3.12 million\u2014from the main liquidity pool into a fresh wallet. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP($3.12M) to a new wallet.https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiAhttps://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 That move came without any heads-up or clear reason. Now, many investors worry that the team might be preparing to dump coins, which would add selling pressure to a coin already struggling with low demand. Whale Places Huge Sell Order Based on reports, a major wallet known as Kewh32 has put 275,672 TRUMP tokens on the market, roughly $2.5 million at current prices. This whale also sold 100,000 tokens earlier in June and still holds 369,400 coins. If those tokens ever hit exchanges, the added supply could push the price even lower. Price Pattern Offers Mixed Signal On the daily chart, TRUMP has traced out a falling wedge pattern. That setup often leads to a breakout, but only when buyers step in with strength. Here, trading volumes remain weak. The relative strength index (RSI) has sat below 50 for over a month, signaling that sellers are still in control. At the same time, the Awesome Oscillator just flipped green\u2014albeit still below zero\u2014which hints that bearish momentum may be fading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Investor Confidence Falters Many traders are watching the $8 to $9 range closely. A failure to hold above $8 could spell more losses and test deeper support. Right now, there\u2019s no sign of a strong rally. Without fresh buying interest or positive news, the downtrend inside the wedge looks set to continue. It won\u2019t take much to spark a short squeeze\u2014maybe a burst of social media hype or a big buy from another whale. But trust in the token\u2019s team is shaky after the recent liquidity pull. Until on-chain activity shows real demand, most market players expect more choppy trading and lower prices. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
