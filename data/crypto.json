      "summary": "According to CNBC\u2019s Power Lunch, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin could climb all the way to $1 million per coin if big institutions keep piling in. The cryptocurrency hit a weekly peak of $110,290 on Tuesday. It slipped 4.5% to $104,300 by Thursday, but it\u2019s still climbed 1.75% over the past seven days. Novogratz says this isn\u2019t just hype. He points to firms moving cash from dollars and gold into crypto. Related Reading: BTC Is Just 0.2% Of Global Wealth \u2014 And That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Not Too Late: Analyst Institutional Moves Up Demand BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went live in January 2024 after SEC approval. Based on reports, that fund now gives big investors a straightforward path to own Bitcoin without buying coins directly. BlackRock manages about $11.6 trillion in assets. When a player that size steps in, others notice. Novogratz says wealth managers and pension funds have started treating Bitcoin like a macro asset, on par with gold and the S&#38;P 500. Growing Corporate Interest Treasury companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to follow suit. Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright. Related Reading: TRX Price Up As Tron Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Trump-Backed Stablecoin According to filings, Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop, and US President Donald Trump\u2019s Media arm all announced major purchases this year. Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin Versus Gold Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1\u20132% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn\u2019t guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today\u2019s $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Challenges Ahead Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin\u2019s price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn\u2019t impossible, but it won\u2019t happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin\u2019s march toward gold\u2019s market cap as a \u201cball rolling down a hill.\u201d He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it.

      "summary": "The XRP price could be preparing for its biggest rally yet, as a crypto analyst now points to a potential breakout that could send this altcoin soaring. After weeks of stabilization and momentum building, XRP is now testing key resistance levels, with the daily timeframe hinting at a possible surge above $2.33. XRP Price Gears Up For Major Breakout Dark Defender, an X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst, has revealed in a recent analysis that XRP appears to be setting the stage for a significant price shift, with its daily chart signaling a possible upward breakout. After weeks of consolidation below a descending trendline, the altcoin is now approaching a critical level that could become the trigger point for rapid momentum growth, if confirmed. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target Currently, the daily timeframe shows XRP testing a long-term downtrend line that has consistently rejected upward movements since early 2025. This resistance level, marked clearly on the analyst\u2019s chart, hovers just above $2.3. Dark Defender has indicated that a daily candle close above $2.33 could effectively invalidate the downtrend and signal a breakout that may lead to further upside. Notably, the analyst\u2019s 1-day XRP price chart shows an explosive move toward a new high of $3.39\u2014a level not seen since the 2018 bull cycle. With XRP currently trading at $2.1, a successful rally to this bullish target would represent an impressive 61.43% surge in value. Such a move would not only break XRP out of its current consolidation phase but also confirm the emergence of a sustained uptrend. Moreover, if momentum persists, it could set the stage for even higher price levels. RSI And EMA Signals Defend XRP\u2019s Bullish Thesis Supporting Dark Defender\u2019s technical analysis and bullish scenario for the XRP price is a rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has broken above a descending trendline and continues to trend upward. This shift suggests that XRP is building momentum as buyers finally regain control. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says XRP Is No Longer A Speculative Asset \u2013 Here\u2019s What It Is Additionally, the analysis shows that price action remains above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), which are beginning to curl upward, signaling that the market trends could be turning in favor of the bulls. Although the Ichimoku Cloud technical indicator is not visible on the chart, Dark Defender notes that it is expected to flip bullish soon, further reinforcing XRP\u2019s bullish thesis. Combined with the support held above the 200-day EMA, highlighted by the blue line on the chart, XRP appears to be entering a favorable technical zone. If price action aligns with the analyst\u2019s projected setup and manages to hold candle closes above $2.33, it could mark the beginning of a stronger uptrend. Dark Defender also notes that \u201cXRP\u2019s slingshot pressure\u201d is intensifying rapidly, further boosting the potential strength of the upcoming bullish wave.

      "summary": "The Hash Ribbon \u201cbuy\u201d trigger \u2013 a signal embedded in Bitcoin\u2019s network hashrate dynamics \u2013 has flashed again, and technical analyst Astronomer Zero believes it could pave the way to at least $170,000 per coin. A chart the analyst posted on X on 12 June overlays every prior weekly\u2010time-frame Hash Ribbon entry since 2020 on the BTC/USDT perpetual contract at Binance, illustrating why the signal is treated with almost talismanic respect by some quantitative traders. Bitcoin Surge To $170,000 Imminent? The graphic shows five earlier occurrences of the capitulation-to-recovery crossover embedded in the Hash Ribbon algorithm. Each is marked on the price pane by a cobalt-blue \u201cBuy\u201d dot directly beneath the weekly candles and linked to the ensuing rally by a violet measuring arrow. After the signal in late-2020, Bitcoin accelerated by 235% from the $18,000 consolidation floor to challenge the then-all-time-high zone just above $60,000 before any major pull-back unfolded. Mid-2021\u2019s ribbon event proved more modest \u2013 roughly 59% from a $30,000 base into resistance near $48,000 \u2013 yet it still respected the rule that the market rewards the crossover with significant upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Flips Again And History Says A Rally Is Around The Corner The next two signals, printed in late-2022 and early-2023, were far stronger: a 260% surge from the capitulation trough below $18,000, followed by a 175% leg in mid-2023 that carried price cleanly to the long-standing supply shelf in the $60,000 area. In mid-2024, the hash ribbon signal led to a 100% rally above $100,000. Most recently, the ribbon crossed again three weeks ago, with Bitcoin quoted at roughly $105,000 on the weekly close. The analyst annotates current price at $106,873 and draws a fresh horizontal barrier at the $160,000\u2013$165,000 band \u2013 the level that would align with the mean magnitude of earlier post-signal advances. Were the market merely to match the smallest historical percentage move (\u2248 60%) from the present crossover, spot would extend to the $170,000 region indicated in crimson on the chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: \u2018Fair Price\u2019 Today Is $230,000 Hash Ribbon logic is mechanical. When the 30-day moving average of network hashrate climbs back above the 60-day average after a period of miner capitulation, on-chain observers read it as an all-clear that forced selling pressure has exhausted. In the past, that transition has coincided with aggressive spot accumulation visible on-chain and in derivatives positioning. Sceptics will note that correlation is not causation and that a six-figure quote for Bitcoin already bakes in ETF inflows, a looming halving supply shock and a global liquidity cycle that could yet tighten. Still, Astronomer Zero\u2019s chart underscores an objective fact: in the last half-decade the Hash Ribbon \u201cbuy\u201d has never mis-fired. Whether history\u2019s rhythm repeats or merely rhymes, traders are watching the $170,000 level marked on the chart as the next test of that record. At press time, BTC was down 3.1% over the past 24 hours, trading at $104,898. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

His outlook came as Congress moved to set new rules on how these tokens must be backed. Related Reading: TRX Price Up As Tron Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Trump-Backed Stablecoin Growth Forecast Details According to Bloomberg, Bessent said a leading industry group expects the stablecoin market cap to top $2 trillion. He called that view \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d It would mean backing up to $2 trillion in tokens with US Treasury Bills. Based on reports, Citigroup analysts think issuers might buy an extra $1 trillion in those bills by 2030.

The amendment won cloture yesterday. That clears the way for a final vote, likely early next week. Supporters say the change will boost confidence by ensuring every dollar-linked token has real backing. Market Size Today Right now, the total stablecoin market sits at about $255 billion. Dollar-pegged coins make up roughly $233 billion of that. That equals 90% of the whole market. The top nine dollar-pegged coins include USDT, USDC, USDe, DAI, USD1, FDUSD, PYUSD, TUSD, and USDD. They account for nearly all stablecoin activity. Challenges Ahead Regulators have work to do. If the GENIUS Act stalls or changes, issuers might head to friendlier markets. There\u2019s also a risk that a handful of big players could dominate. That could create new \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d worries if a major issuer faces trouble. Plus, tech glitches and smart-contract bugs could still trigger runs on tokens.

Every $1 trillion in token issuance backed by Treasury Bills might add to demand for US debt. But the path isn\u2019t guaranteed. Lawmakers must iron out rules that balance safety with innovation. Issuers need strong risk plans. And users must see clear benefits beyond speculation. For now, the market is small compared with the broader financial system.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-price-crashes-below-103000/",
      "summary": "After hitting $110,450 on Monday, the Bitcoin price is writing its third consecutive red day as the benchmark cryptocurrency fell 5.3% from an intra-day top of $108,450 to a trough of $102,664 before clawing back to about $104,456 by press time. The sell-off coincided, almost minute-for-minute, with confirmation that Israel had conducted large-scale air-strikes on Iranian nuclear installations, sending ripples through every major asset class. Why Is Bitcoin Going Down Today? Israel\u2019s pre-dawn operation \u2014 its first overt attack on Iranian territory since the October-2024 raids \u2014 instantly repriced global risk. Oil futures jumped more than 10%, spot gold printed a fresh record high above $3,400 an ounce, and US equity futures slid roughly 1.5%. Bitcoin\u2019s draw-down resembled its initial reaction to Iran\u2019s failed missile barrage on Israel in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside \u201cOil up. Gold up. Bitcoin down,\u201d Anthony Pompliano wrote on X, noting that the pattern echoes April\u2019s missile incident, after which \u201cBitcoin ended up outperforming the other two over the first 48 hours.\u201d Bitcoin educator Peter Duan argued in a separate post that \u201ca dip in Bitcoin happens every time there is serious geopolitical [turmoil] \u2026 In the long run, this will only push more people to Bitcoin,\u201d pointing to the 24/7 nature of crypto trading versus the still-closed equity cash markets. Macro strategist Joe Consorti drilled down on the mechanics: \u201cBitcoin, S&#38;P and NDX are all being panic-sold. Crude oil, natural gas, gold and US Treasuries are all spiking higher. The flight to safety trade is here.\u201d A fresh surge in crude is precisely what US policymakers did not need. West Texas Intermediate vaulted past $77 a barrel\u2014its first visit to that level in four months\u2014after Israel struck Iranian nuclear facilities, erasing much of the hard-won disinflation dividend and dragging energy back to centre stage. The contract is now more than $21 above its April trough, threatening to unwind the benign price trends that had been taking hold. This comes after US inflation data once again surprised to the upside this week. May\u2019s Consumer Price Index rose just 0.1% on the month and 2.4% year-over-year, while core CPI matched that modest 0.1% gain and held at 2.8% on an annual basis. Producer prices told a similar tale on Thursday, with the headline PPI up only 0.1% month-over-month and 2.6% on the year, both below consensus expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: \u2018Fair Price\u2019 Today Is $230,000 Lower fuel costs had been a cornerstone of President Trump\u2019s strategy for reining in inflation; the renewed march higher in oil now threatens that narrative. If energy continues to climb, markets will anticipate a rebound in headline inflation and the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to postpone the rate-cut cycle traders had pencilled in for September. Bitcoin, which is acutely sensitive to fluctuations in global liquidity, often underperforms when the policy outlook tilts toward tighter financial conditions\u2014explaining its abrupt slide alongside the spike in crude. The newsflow triggered one of the heaviest forced-liquidation washes of 2025. CoinGlass data show that roughly $1.14 billion in crypto futures positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours, $1.04 billion of which were longs, as 236,788 traders were forced out of the market. The single-largest hit was a $201 million BTC-USDT long on Binance, the biggest one-ticket liquidation since January. For Bitcoin alone, long-side liquidations totalled $443 million. For the entire crypto market, this is the worst wipe-out since"
