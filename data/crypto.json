      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-woes-to-continue-analyst-expects-ada/",
      "summary": "The Cardano price performance has been nothing short of shambolic since the start of May, falling from the lofty heights of $0.85 in less than two months. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin\u2019s value has declined by more than 24% in the past month. While the price of ADA saw an explosive growth at the beginning of the second quarter, the token is now back where it started in April \u2014 just above the $0.5 mark. Interestingly, the signs are pointing to further decline for the Cardano price over the next few weeks. ADA Price Stuck In Descending Channel On Friday, June 27, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez took to the social media platform X to share an ominous prediction for the ADA token\u2019s price. According to the crypto pundit, the Cardano price could be heading to around $0.47 for its next support. Related Reading: Ethereum\u2019s Network Is Heating Up While Price Stalls, Is a Breakout Coming? This bearish projection revolves around the appearance of a descending channel pattern on the three-day Cardano chart. A descending channel is a chart formation in technical analysis characterized by two major trendlines: the upper line acting as the resistance level and the lower line acting as the support level. The space between these trendlines serves as the channel within which prices move over a period. Typically, the formation of a descending channel suggests the persistence of a downward price trend and lower highs. At the same time, traders can use this pattern to identify optimal entry and exit points. The Cardano price chart above, for instance, shows that the altcoin price has been in a downward trend since last November. The token seemed to have turned its fortune around after finding support at the lower trendline in early April and running back above the $0.8 level. However, the Cardano price failed to break the upper trendline at the beginning of May and has since been experiencing a downturn. According to Martinez, the ADA token could fall to as low as $0.47 \u2014 around the lower trendline \u2014 to find a support cushion. Moreover, the 1.272 Fibonacci level \u2014 used in technical analysis to identify price targets and support or resistance levels \u2014 is also around the lower trendline. Ultimately, this means that the Cardano price could fall even lower than its current price point. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the ADA token is valued at around $0.56, reflecting a 1.3% price jump in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the price of Cardano is down by more than 3% in the last seven days.

      "summary": "In line with the broader crypto market, Aptos (APT) experienced a remarkable price upswing in the past week culminating in a market gain of 12.53%. However, the prominent altcoin remains in a corrective phase with a price loss of 8.75% on its monthly chart. Aptos has famously underperformed in the crypto bullish resurgence that kicked off in April reaching a local peak of $6.14 while the present market cycle top lies around $17.90. However, popular market analyst with X username PlanD has tipped the altcoin to maintain its most recent uptrend as indicated by a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish Aptos Ready For Major Bullish Price Reversal &#8211; Analyst In a recent X post on June 27, PlanD provides an insightful technical analysis on the APT market hinting at a major price surge ahead . Firstly, the renowned analyst explains APT has shown consistent price movement within a descending channel over the past two and half years. However, APT price action in the past three months have twice retested the lower boundary of this channel, thereby forming a double bottom pattern &#8211; a bullish reversal pattern formed when price forms two similar lows separated by a rebound as seen between April till date on the chart below. &#160; The peak of the intervening price rebound serves as the pattern\u2019s neckline, and a breakout above this level confirms the market&#8217;s intent for a bullish reversal. Therefore, if APT bulls can secure a decisive daily close above $6.00, it would likely trigger a broader market rebound, with price targets set around $9.92, representing an estimated 100% gain on present market prices. Beyond $9.92, a sustained buying pressure could force APT to return to its cycle top at $17.90 which currently aligns with the upper boundary of the descending price channel. According to PlanD\u2019s analysis, a successful breakout above this long-standing channel exposes investors to lofty price targets as high as $55 and $79. On the cautionary note, APT bulls must avoid a price rejection at the $6.00 region, which represents the market\u2019s next major resistance. The occurrence of such a scenario would suggest a delay of the purported or invalidation in the case of price fall below the present support line at the lower boundary of the descending channel.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst XForce has predicted that Ethereum could reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $10,000 in this market cycle. He acknowledged that there is yet to be a macro fundamental that supports this bullish outlook, but remarked that it remains \u201cideal.\u201d Ethereum Eyeing Rally To As High As $10,000 In an X post, XForce stated that Ethereum is still looking to shoot for a new ATH this cycle and could end around $9,000 to $10,000. This followed his remarks that ETH\u2019s move up on the shorter timeframes was objectively impulsive. In other words, these rallies were bullish with real-time technical indicators. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of 2021? Here\u2019s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow As to what could drive this Ethereum rally to $10,000, XForce noted that there is no macro scenario providing a good look. However, he remarked that this rally to this ambitious target remains only ideal in nature, given the context. The analyst added that this idea remains his primary prediction for now. Crypto analyst Venturefounder also recently predicted that Ethereum could reach this $10,000 price target in this market cycle. However, the analyst declared that ETH\u2019s run to this ambitious target depends on whether the altcoin is able to flip $4,000 into support by the fourth quarter of this year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also recently suggested that Ethereum was ready for a lift-off. In an X post, he stated that after a failed breakout, ETH deviated below and found support right on the cloud. Now, the altcoin is back within the range. For a bullish momentum to resume, Titan of Crypto claimed that ETH must clear the cloud and reclaim the Kijun around $2,500. The analyst had previously predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,500 in this market cycle. An Ultra Bullish Scenario For ETH In response to his initial X post, XForce provided an alternative scenario for Ethereum, in which it could rally to as high as $150,000. The analyst remarked that it would be wild to see this play out, but that it remains an option based on an idealized 5-wave structure. ETH is expected to reach the $150,000 target on Wave 5. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000? XForce\u2019s accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could reach this $150,000 target by July 2028. The analyst remarked that the uber bullish scenario remains his alternative because there seems to be no logical approach for ETH to reach such levels. He again warned that neither scenario provides the proper context on the macro, but only remains ideal. As such, based on logic, XForce remarked that it is best to choose the best of the worst. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,400, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/gemini-tokenize-bitcoin-heavy-stock-best-altcoins/",
      "summary": "Gemini, a popular crypto exchange, has just launched a tokenized version of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (MSTR) stock for EU users. Strategy is a Bitcoin-investing firm currently holding 592,345 $BTC, making it one of the largest institutional holders of the asset. As such, a tokenized version of Strategy\u2019s stock is an indirect but powerful way of offering on-chain participants more $BTC exposure. This also bridges the gap between traditional stock markets and on-chain infrastructure by addressing key issues like limited trading hours and high international fees. Gemini has partnered with Dinari in an attempt to offer more liquidity and transparency by leveraging the latter\u2019s tokenization-on-demand model. Read on to learn more about this exciting development and why it could positively impact your crypto portfolio. We\u2019ll also highlight the best altcoins you can invest in right now. Tokenized Stocks Are Here, and Crypto Investors Should Be Excited Tokenization converts real-world assets into digital tokens. For example, Tether Gold ($XAUT) is the tokenized version of gold. Currently, $MSTR is the only US equity stock to be tokenized for EU investors. However, Gemini says that more such tokenized stocks and ETFs will be launched soon. It&#8217;s fair to say that tokenization is the future of investing, as it closes the gap between the traditional stock market and blockchain participation. It allows crypto investors to diversify their portfolios without leaving the secure environment. Gemini\u2019s choice of $MSTR also aligns well with crypto enthusiasts because it offers them the opportunity to invest in a crypto-native firm. Considering all this, this is probably an opportune time to invest in some hot new meme coins, i.e., if you wish to ride the tokenization trend. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Best Altcoin to Buy Now, Swipe Liquidity in New Meme Coins Snorter Token ($SNORT) is a new crypto changing the way retailers trade meme coins. It&#8217;s a Telegram-based trading bot that swipes liquidity in newly listed meme coins with automatic limit, stop, and stop-loss orders. Additionally, Snorter Bot only charges 0.85% as trading fees, as opposed to the 1% charged by competitors Banana Gun and Bonk Bot. To access the industry-lowest trading fees, though, you&#8217;ll have to be a $SNORT holder. Owning $SNORT also comes with the potential to make 1,400% returns in less than five years, as the crypto is predicted to explode and reach $1.25 by 2030. In addition to comprehensive security, Snorter Bot also comes with an excellent copy-trading feature, allowing you to mimic successful traders without leaving the Telegram chat. $SNORT is currently in presale, with over $1.35M in funding so far. Even better, you can buy one token for just $0.0965. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Only Crypto to Buy Now for Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the newest \u2013 and probably the smartest \u2013 way to become a part of Bitcoin&#8217;s success story. As the digital gold climbs to new highs, so can your portfolio if you buy $BTCBULL and store it in Best Wallet. That way, you&#8217;ll be eligible for free Bitcoin airdrops. Yep, BTC Bull Token is the ONLY crypto in the world to offer token holders free (and real) $BTC. These airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin hits a new milestone, like $150K and $200K. Plus, $BTCBULL is expected to surge 277% and reach $0.0096 by 2026. Furthermore, the developers have also planned to follow a deflationary approach. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be burnt off every time Bitcoin climbs up by $50K. This will ensure continuing token hype and price appreciation. If you want to benefit from $BTCBULL, buy the token now while it&#8217;s still in presale. The project has in total raised over $7.5M, and each token is currently available for just $0.00258. Here&#8217;s how to buy it. 3. Dog (Bitcoin) ($DOG) \u2013 Canine-Themed Crypto Poised to Pump With dog-themed meme coins expected to make a strong comeback thanks to the SEC warming up to the idea of a $DOGE ETF, $DOG could be one of the next cryptos to explode. $DOG might not be as mainstream as, say, Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, but it stands out because it&#8217;s built directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. It&#8217;s a community-driven token with no real utility other than to prove crypto degens some meme coin fun right on Bitcoin, one of the most secure blockchains out there. $DOG is currently trading at $0.003911, having gained more than 28% over the past 7 days. According to recent price action, it&#8217;s about to break out of a descending triangle pattern, so we can expect a surge sooner rather than later. Conclusion With a major crypto exchange like Gemini launching a tokenized version of a US stock, it wouldn&#8217;t be wrong to say that the sky&#8217;s the limit for digital assets. If you&#8217;d like front-row seats to this revolution, consider investing in high-potential tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). However, bear in mind that none of this is financial advice; the crypto market is highly volatile. So, kindly do your own research before investing."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ondo-breaks-out-of-ascending-channel-analyst-sets-0-29-target/",
      "summary": "ONDO is under pressure after a sharp 33% decline from its May highs, reflecting growing uncertainty and bearish momentum across the market. Once a standout performer, the token has lost steam as sentiment shifts and price action turns decisively negative. While some traders are still watching for potential rebounds, many analysts are now calling for a breakdown, warning that the current structure could give way to deeper losses if key support levels fail to hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms 4-Year Inverse H&#38;S Pattern \u2013 Neckline Break Could Send It Parabolic The mood around ONDO remains divided. Some investors view the dip as a healthy retrace in a broader uptrend, while others see it as the start of a more extended correction. Top analyst Ali Martinez has added to the cautious outlook, noting that ONDO is breaking out of an ascending channel to the downside\u2014an often bearish signal. This pattern suggests that momentum is weakening and that the token could soon test lower demand zones. With ONDO hovering near key technical levels and volume thinning, the coming days will be critical. If the breakdown continues, the price could revisit earlier consolidation areas. For now, bearish pressure dominates, and bulls must defend support convincingly to prevent further downside. Bulls Struggle To Hold Structure As Risks Grow As the broader altcoin market braces for a decisive move, ONDO remains trapped in a bearish structure, unable to establish clear demand. Bulls have struggled to reclaim momentum or push price above critical supply zones needed to maintain the long-term uptrend. With sellers dominating and key support levels under pressure, ONDO\u2019s technical structure appears fragile. Despite recent weakness, some market participants remain cautiously optimistic about ONDO\u2019s longer-term potential. Macro narratives around real-world asset tokenization continue to support fundamental interest, but short-term price action remains a challenge. The inability to hold above prior consolidation ranges suggests that buyers are not yet stepping in with enough conviction to flip the trend. Ali Martinez has raised alarms by highlighting a concerning technical development: ONDO is breaking out of an ascending channel\u2014this time to the downside. Historically, this pattern signals a shift in market structure and sets the stage for more aggressive downside moves. Martinez\u2019s outlook points to a potential slide toward the $0.29 level, which would mark a significant breakdown from current prices. For now, ONDO trades in a vulnerable position. If bulls fail to reclaim higher levels and restore momentum, the altcoin risks accelerating its decline. However, if sentiment shifts and broader market strength returns, ONDO could still recover in the coming months. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record High: 29.02% Of Supply Locked Signals Long-Term Conviction ONDO Breaks Below Moving Averages As Bearish Momentum Builds ONDO is trading at $0.747 after failing to hold above key moving averages, with both the 50-day ($0.93) and 200-day ($1.00) simple moving averages now acting as overhead resistance. The current price structure on the 3-day chart shows a consistent downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows forming since the March peak. Price has now broken below the prior consolidation zone, signaling growing bearish momentum. The rejection from the $1.00 psychological level earlier this quarter added to downward pressure, and the break of the $0.80 level confirms that bulls are losing control of short-term structure. If ONDO continues to trade below both moving averages, it may struggle to find solid demand in the near term. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure \u2013 Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25\u2013$30 Surge Key historical resistance remains at $1.51, but with ONDO currently 50% below that level and forming a bearish structure, downside risk continues to dominate. A breakdown below $0.70 could accelerate the fall, potentially targeting the $0.60\u2013$0.50 range where previous demand clusters formed in late 2023. For bulls to regain momentum, ONDO must reclaim the 50-day SMA and close above $0.85. Until then, the chart favors the bears, and the trend suggests caution for long positions.
