      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-outperforming-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "With one week already gone in the month of July, Ethereum has already begun to perform better than Bitcoin. While the gap is still very close, the outperformance of Ethereum over Bitcoin for only the second time this year could signal the entrance of better things for the altcoin market. If this continues, then an altcoin season might be on the horizon, as historical data shows it always begins with ETH outperforming BTC. So, let\u2019s take a look at how both assets have been performing. Ethereum Barrels Ahead Of Bitcoin In July So far, in the month of July, the Ethereum price has been putting in more green candles, suggesting that bulls are making their move again. This has led to a small outperformance when compared to the Bitcoin price over this time period and could be the signal that altcoin season could be starting soon. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could See 180% Explosion As This Indicator Flashes Bullish Divergence Data from the CryptoRank website shows that Ethereum is already up more than 2.50% since the start of July. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price, while having seen some price increases, is up only 1.20% at the time of this writing. Thus, Ethereum is already performing better in the month of July. If this outperformance continues, then this would be only the second time that the Ethereum price will be doing better than the Bitcoin price so far in 2025. The first was back in May, when the Ethereum price rallied by over 41% in one month. This was major compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 11.1% move in that month. However, while the Bitcoin rally in the month of May saw its price reach new all-time highs, Ethereum continues to struggle and remains below its $4,800 all-time high levels. Nevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s rally did translate to bullishness for the altcoin market as the likes of PEPE and BONK rallied by more than 100% in response to this. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here\u2019s The Target Given that Ethereum has led the altcoin season in the past, its outperformance of Bitcoin at this level remains a positive. If it continues, then the altcoin market could start to see further increases in price. And if Ethereum rises another 41% from here, it would put it right on the path to $4,000. However, the month of July has not historically been the best month for Ethereum, with an average return of +5.13%. The whole of the third quarter of the year is also a mixed bag for the altcoin, with an equal number of green and red closes over the last decade. Thus, it remains to be seen how the ETH price will perform this quarter and if it can successfully outpace Bitcoin. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "As the crypto market moves sideways, Solana (SOL) compresses between two key levels. Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is about to break out and reclaim a crucial resistance level, which could trigger the long-awaited retest of the $200 barrier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back In \u2018Retesting Phase\u2019 After Key Level Reclaim \u2013 The Calm Before The Storm? Solana Holds Key Support After recovering from last month\u2019s downtrend, Solana has been attempting to reclaim the crucial $160 level to continue its bullish rally. The cryptocurrency traded between the $140-$180 range for two months, but briefly lost its post-breakout range in late June. Two weeks ago, SOL fell below the $130 area, hitting a two-month low of $126 on June 22. Since then, the altcoin has recovered, fueled by last week\u2019s launch of a Solana staked crypto Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US by Rex Shares. Following the news, Solana\u2019s price jumped toward the $160 resistance level but was rejected, hovering between the $145-$155 price range for the past week. On Tuesday, SOL fell below the $150 level, hitting the $147 support before bouncing. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that the $147.59 area is one of the most important support levels for Solana, as losing this level could trigger a pullback to the next key zone around the $141 mark. Similarly, market watcher Man of Bitcoin affirmed that SOL\u2019s key support to maintain is around $141.91, adding that \u201ca sustained break below this level would suggest that wave-C of (ii) is already underway.\u201d The analyst previously warned that there is a potential scenario \u201cwith one more low in wave-5,\u201d if the cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t hold about the $148 mark. However, maintaining this support would build a base to target the local highs. SOL About To Retest $160? Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show affirmed that SOL is \u201cabout to break off\u201d a triangle formation and test the $162 resistance. As the price compresses between the upper and lower boundaries, the analyst suggested that the cryptocurrency\u2019s breakout is around the corner. Notably, Solana has been forming a one-week symmetrical triangle pattern in the daily chart. If the cryptocurrency successfully breaks above the $152-$153 zone, it could see a 10.87% jump toward the technical target of $167. The Cryptonomist highlighted that SOL broke out of a multi-day diagonal resistance on Sunday, which was retested and confirmed as support after bouncing around the $147 twice since the breakout. Related Reading: 50% Bitcoin Price Crash On The Horizon? Analyst Reveals $60,000 Target The analyst considers that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a continuation of its rally, targeting the one-week high and resistance of $160. Meanwhile, Crypto Jelle noted that despite the April downside deviation, Solana continues to trade within its $125-$180 Macro Range, currently hovering around the mid-range. To him, \u201cit looks like it&#8217;s just waiting for BTC to break out. Once it reclaims $160, $200 should come quickly. Above there, new all-time highs are within reach.\u201d As of this writing, Solana is trading at $151.51, a 3.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-stablecoin-diverge-binance-explosion/",
      "summary": "On-chain data shows the Binance Exchange Reserve has diverged between Bitcoin and the stablecoins. Here&#8217;s what this could mean for the market. Bitcoin &#38; Stablecoin Exchange Reserves Have Decoupled On Binance In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binance Exchange Reserve for Bitcoin and the stablecoins. The &#8220;Exchange Reserve&#8221; here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that&#8217;s sitting on the wallets attached to a centralized exchange. When the value of this metric rises, it means the holders are making net deposits of the asset to the platform. Generally, investors use exchanges when they want to participate in trading activities, so them making inflows could signal appetite for trading the coin away. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit 8-Week Streak\u2014Institutions Still Buying For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this is something that can naturally have a bearish impact on the price. The same, however, isn&#8217;t true in the case of the stablecoins, as they are, by definition, always stable around the same value as the fiat currency that they are pegged to. Investors usually store their capital in the form of these tokens when they want to avoid the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin. Many of them, however, plan to eventually return back to the volatile side. Once they have decided to make the switch, they transfer their stablecoins to exchanges. When they make the swap to a coin like Bitcoin, its price naturally observes a buying boost. As such, stablecoin inflows can be bullish for the volatile cryptocurrencies. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Exchange Reserve of Binance for Bitcoin and the stablecoins over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Binance Exchange Reserve for the two asset classes showed some correlation in 2024. But by the end of the year, a shift had occurred, with the stablecoins witnessing sharp inflows and Bitcoin outflows. The two have remained decoupled in 2025 so far, although their trends no longer diverge as extremely. The stablecoin Binance exchange reserve has recently been trending sideways, while the one for Bitcoin has rapidly been moving down.

This could hint at bullish conditions aligning on the largest cryptocurrency exchange, but it only remains to be seen whether the setup would reflect in the Bitcoin price or not.

      "summary": "Dogecoin started a fresh increase above the $0.1680 zone against the US Dollar. DOGE is now consolidating and might aim for a move above $0.1720. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1650 and $0.1680 levels. The price is trading above the $0.1680 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1680 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh rally if it clears the $0.1720 and $0.1750 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase from the $0.1650 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE was able to climb above the $0.1665 and $0.1680 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.170 resistance. There was a steady increase and the price even spiked above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1722 swing high to the $0.1657 low. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.1680 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1680 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1720 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1730 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1722 swing high to the $0.1657 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.1750 level. A close above the $0.1750 resistance might send the price toward the $0.180 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.200 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2120. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.1750 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1680 level or the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $0.1650 level. The main support sits at $0.1610. If there is a downside break below the $0.1610 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1550 level or even $0.1520 in the near term.
