      "summary": "Ethereum has remained in a volatile consolidation phase, trading between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels as geopolitical tensions weigh heavily on global markets. After last week\u2019s failed breakout above resistance, ETH has retraced yet again, struggling to build sustained momentum. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified market uncertainty, contributing to spikes in volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation \u2013 Details Despite the macro headwinds, Ethereum bulls continue to defend key support levels, preventing a deeper breakdown. The $2,400 zone has acted as a strong floor in recent weeks, absorbing sell pressure and keeping ETH within its current trading range. Meanwhile, the $2,800 resistance remains the major hurdle to reclaim for a bullish breakout scenario. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum is still consolidating below a key resistance area. This structure indicates that ETH is coiling before its next major move. The window for a potential breakout narrows as price tightens within this established range. Ethereum Prepares To Move Ethereum has pushed into a critical price zone, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,600\u2013$2,700 range after recent volatility. The asset has shown resilience, rebounding from last week\u2019s lows and re-entering the mid-range of its multi-week consolidation. With price action once again approaching the $2,800 resistance level, market participants are eyeing a potential breakout that could open the door to $3,000 and beyond. Analysts remain divided. On one side, bullish momentum and improving market sentiment suggest ETH is preparing for a larger move. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger aggressive buying and initiate a broader altcoin rally. Many investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of a rotation from Bitcoin into high-beta assets like Ethereum, hoping to ride the next phase of the cycle. On the other side, caution persists. Some technical analysts argue that Ethereum may still be at risk of losing steam, especially if the price gets rejected again at resistance. A failure to maintain the current range could result in a retracement toward $2,400 support or even lower, shaking out weak hands. According to a recent technical update from Jelle, Ethereum remains locked in consolidation just below its key resistance zone. The analysis points to a tightening structure where the window of opportunity is closing. If ETH breaks above this zone, it could ignite fireworks across the altcoin market. With global uncertainty still present and traders closely watching resistance levels, Ethereum\u2019s next move could define the pace of the broader market. Whether it\u2019s a breakout or a breakdown, the coming days are likely to be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support \u2013 Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Action: Technical Details Ethereum is currently trading at $2,606, maintaining a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 as shown in the 12-hour chart. After multiple rejections around the $2,800 zone, the asset is struggling to break through this resistance level decisively. Despite the volatility triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty and Middle East conflict, ETH has managed to defend the $2,500 area, supported by a rising 100-period moving average. The recent bounce from the lower end of the range suggests that bulls are still active, stepping in to defend critical structure. However, volume remains relatively muted, indicating that buyers are cautious and awaiting confirmation before initiating larger positions. Meanwhile, the 50-period moving average remains above the 200-period MA, hinting at a medium-term bullish bias if support continues to hold.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-is-still-bullish/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst X Force has drawn the crypto community\u2019s attention to a key fractal from 2023, which paints a bullish picture for the Bitcoin price. However, the analyst suggested that a drop to $90,000 could still be on the cards for BTC, although that won\u2019t invalidate the macro setup. Key Fractal Shows Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish In an X post, X Force highlighted a key fractal from the early phase of the 2023 bull market and noted why it supports the view that the current trend remains bullish. He remarked that the price structure that was observed back then could offer insights relevant to the current analysis, as history often rhymes even though it might not repeat itself exactly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000 Imminent As Fibonacci Resistance Is At Stake X Force then noted that in 2023, a larger degree wave 1 terminated, followed by a shallow wave 2 that retraced only to the 23.6% to 38.2% Fibonacci levels. The analyst then declared that this interpretation wasn\u2019t just hindsight but it was the only valid count even in real-time. He also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price creating another low. X Force explained that the context of the micro timeframes is losing weight as every bounce and dump is extremely sensitive to the overall creation of the wave structure. Meanwhile, the analyst indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop to as low as $90,000 but noted that it is important that BTC remains above this critical support level. In an X post, the crypto analyst stated that as long as the Bitcoin price stays above the $90,000 level, the implications of the shorter-term price action have zero impact on the overall macro trend. X Force added that pullbacks and choppiness are not only healthy but vital to any bull market. A BTC Price Crash Imminent? Veteran trader Peter Brandt has raised the possibility of a Bitcoin price crash happening soon. In an X post, he questioned if November 2021 was happening all over again for the flagship crypto. His accompanying chart showed how that period formed the cycle peak for BTC, following a double top formation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $107,000 Is Ideal, But Don\u2019t Get Excited Until This Happens The Bitcoin price then crashed from its all-time high (ATH) of around $69,000 and consolidated for over two years before witnessing another breakout in 2024. The chart indicated that BTC may have formed a double top again following the recent rally to a new all-time high of $111,900. If so, this could mark the end of the cycle\u2019s bull run, with a crash set to follow. However, the chart suggested that BTC could sustain this bull run if it holds above $104,612. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $106,700, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Ethereum is holding strong despite a week filled with extreme volatility and heightened geopolitical tensions. Following escalations in the Middle East, with conflict between Israel and Iran fueling global market uncertainty, ETH managed to maintain its critical price range. After briefly dipping earlier in the week, Ethereum has reclaimed momentum and is now trading around crucial levels that could define the next move for the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation \u2013 Details Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook suggesting that the bullish scenario remains intact for Ethereum. According to his analysis, ETH is successfully holding its range structure, a key signal that buyers are still in control. This stability at current levels offers confidence to investors watching for a breakout that could lead to a broader altcoin rally. With the macro backdrop still fragile due to rising US Treasury yields and global conflict, Ethereum\u2019s ability to sustain its structure is a sign of relative strength. While the path ahead remains uncertain, all eyes are now on Ethereum\u2019s ability to hold these levels and break through resistance zones. If it does, it could be the trigger needed for renewed momentum in the altcoin market. Ethereum Holds the Line as Bulls Target Breakout Ethereum has gained over 7% since last Friday, recovering from recent lows triggered by macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical instability. The bounce reignited optimism across the market, but price action continues to face a tough challenge at key resistance levels. ETH briefly broke above the $2,800 mark last week, a level that many analysts viewed as a gateway to a broader rally. However, the move lacked follow-through, and Ethereum quickly slipped back below that level, suggesting a lack of conviction or the presence of heavy overhead supply. This divergence in momentum has split analyst opinion. Some argue that Ethereum\u2019s breakout could still ignite a new altcoin season, with ETH leading the charge. Others caution that the repeated failure to sustain higher levels might indicate weakness, and warn that a breakdown below the current range could send Ethereum toward the $2,500 zone or lower. Still, Ted Pillows believes the overall structure remains bullish. His latest analysis emphasizes that the scenario is unchanged: as long as ETH holds the range low as support, the market remains intact and poised to move higher. This support zone has repeatedly acted as a floor for ETH since early May. Ultimately, the next move will be decisive. Ethereum\u2019s ability to hold the range and reclaim $2,800 could pave the way toward $3,000 and beyond. But failure to defend support may increase selling pressure and shift market sentiment. For now, the battle between bulls and bears continues, with Ethereum\u2019s structure offering hope to those betting on an upside breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support \u2013 Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade within a defined range after another failed attempt to break above the $2,800 resistance. According to the chart, ETH is currently priced at $2,626.98, down 0.09% on the 4-hour timeframe. Price action shows strong wicks near the resistance zone, suggesting rejection at the upper boundary around $2,770\u2013$2,800, while buyers stepped in as soon as ETH approached the confluence of the 50, 100, and 200 moving averages between $2,576 and $2,619. This range, which has been developing since early May, remains intact. The chart highlights that ETH has respected the $2,580\u2013$2,620 zone as support, confirming this as the lower bound of the range. As long as ETH holds above this level, bulls are likely to remain in control. However, a failure to reclaim the resistance zone with conviction could lead to another pullback. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week \u2013 Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? Volume has slightly picked up near support, signaling buyer interest, but the lack of follow-through near the highs keeps ETH stuck within its range.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/pepe/pepe-set-for-a-major-rebound/",
      "summary": "Taking a closer look at PEPE recent movement, Crypto Man MAB noted that the token is now trading at $0.00001115, marking a 2.67% uptick in the short term. While the price increase may offer a glimmer of hope for bulls, he emphasized that the 4-hour chart still paints a broader picture of decline. Volume Spikes Tell A Story, But The Trend Stays Bearish According to Crypto Man MAB, PEPE\u2019s 24-hour trading volume stands at 12.97 trillion tokens, valued at around $143.83 million. He describes this activity as moderate, suggesting that while the market isn\u2019t entirely quiet, it lacks the energy typically seen during strong bullish moves. Related Reading: PEPE Shows Strength With A Firm Grip Above This Key Support Zone MAB also highlighted the behavior of the Volume Simple Moving Average (SMA), which has shown several notable spikes. These bursts of activity indicate temporary surges in trader interest, likely sparked by brief price fluctuations or speculative moves. However, the overall volume trend remains in line with the broader decline in price. This volume reflects cautious participation, with traders seemingly waiting on the sidelines for clearer signals before committing more heavily. When it comes to price trends, the numbers speak clearly. Over the past seven days, PEPE is down 2.79%, and over the last 30 days, the decline has deepened to 15.9%. Despite minor recoveries, the persistent downward pressure signals a market struggling to build upward momentum or break free from bearish sentiment. On a longer time frame, the picture grows even more concerning. PEPE has dropped 54.12% over the past 180 days, painting a tough scenario for long-term holders. Still, MAB points out a yearly gain of 2.67%, which, although modest, offers a small glimmer of strength. Key Levels Mark The Battlefield For PEPE&#8217;s Next Move In identifying key technical levels, the analyst pointed out that the recent low near $0.00001069 could serve as a short-term support zone, potentially offering a cushion if prices begin to drop again. This level reflects where buying pressure recently stepped in, making it a crucial area to watch. Related Reading: PEPE Bulls Regain Control As Price Stays Above Moving Average On the upside, the high of $0.00001133 stands out as a potential resistance level, where sellers previously emerged to cap the rally. If PEPE manages to break above this barrier with strong volume, it could open the door for further upside momentum. Drawing his conclusion, Crypto Man MAB noted that the chart indicates volatility with a bearish bias in the short term. However, he highlighted that the recent slight uptick in price, combined with higher trading volume, could suggest potential for a reversal if momentum continues to build.

      "title": "Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What\u2019s Next",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/will-bitcoin-move-above-110000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin&#8217;s current trading range is all part of a consolidation move before a return above $110,000. Although the leading cryptocurrency has largely held above the $105,000 support zones in recent days, its rally has taken a hit in the past two weeks. Technical analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price action, when overlapped with the Global M2 Money Supply metric, shows that it is only a matter of time before it enters into a new all-time high. Global M2 Offset Models Says Something Interesting According to a detailed post by crypto analyst Colin, also known as &#8220;The M2 Guy,&#8221; on the social media platform X, Bitcoin\u2019s price action appears to be tracking the global M2 money supply with a high degree of correlation when the data is offset by 68 to 76 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Two separate charts presented by Colin reveal this trend vividly, showing how Bitcoin price movements have followed the trajectory of the Global M2 Money Supply when adjusted for time. The short-term 68-day offset chart aligns closely with Bitcoin\u2019s behavior since April 2025, while the 76-day offset chart offers a longer-term view of the relationship. In both cases, the analyst highlighted that the M2 curve is pointing upward, where Bitcoin has yet to play out, implying a similarly bullish trajectory for its price action. Colin describes this as a form of confluence, noting that when two correlated indicators show the same directional outcome, the probability of that outcome increases. Particularly, the average correlation across both charts is around 76.6 to 76.9%, both of which are very high and lend statistical weight to the prediction. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? The 68-day offset chart shows Bitcoin trailing the M2 curve with high precision since April, with the highest 89.9% degree of accuracy on the 90-day timeframe. Similarly, the 76-day offset, while less accurate in the short term, displays a strong correlation over longer intervals of 92.2% over one and a half years and 86.2% across two years. These correlation values shows that Bitcoin is increasingly sensitive to global liquidity trends, especially now that its price movement is tied to inflows/outflows surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? This relationship becomes even more notable considering the M2 money supply itself has been climbing within a rising channel. If the alignment continues, Bitcoin may soon follow suit, lifting it back above the $110,000 level and breaking above its all-time high. Bitcoin\u2019s price action will be very interesting to follow in the next few days. In Colin\u2019s view, this next move up is not only likely but could happen within days. If Bitcoin follows this alignment, the projection shows that Bitcoin will continue to move within a channel of higher highs and higher lows before eventually crossing above $150,000 in August. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,549, up by 1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
