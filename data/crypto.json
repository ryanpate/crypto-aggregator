      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-struggles-below-ath-after-weeks-of-failed-attempts-109k-level-in-focus/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has been consolidating in a wide range between $100,000 and $112,000, facing heightened volatility driven by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and growing macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite these external pressures, Bitcoin has held strong above the six-figure mark, signaling resilience as it prepares for a decisive move. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with many traders expecting a breakout in the coming weeks. Related Reading: ONDO Breaks Out Of Ascending Channel \u2013 Analyst Sets $0.29 Target Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting that Bitcoin is now trading just below its all-time high, but continues to face strong resistance around the $109,000\u2013$112,000 zone. Price has tested this level multiple times over the past month, but each attempt has failed to produce a confirmed breakout. During this period, altcoins have suffered sharp drawdowns, with many falling between 10% and 50%, underscoring Bitcoin\u2019s dominance and investor focus. Despite the rejections, bullish momentum is gradually building. Bitcoin\u2019s ability to stay elevated in such a volatile environment suggests that buyers are accumulating, waiting for the right moment to push higher. A confirmed breakout above resistance could trigger a sharp move into price discovery, while failure to hold key support may lead to deeper consolidation before the next leg up. Bitcoin Bulls Push Toward Breakout Bitcoin has gained over 15% since early May, extending a bullish trend that began in April when the price rebounded sharply from the $75,000 level. Since then, buyers have remained in control, consistently defending higher lows and reclaiming key technical levels. This steady rise in momentum has fueled speculation that Bitcoin may soon break into new all-time highs, as market sentiment improves and capital continues flowing into crypto. Analysts are now closely watching the $110,000\u2013$112,000 resistance zone\u2014a level that has held strong despite multiple breakout attempts. Daan noted that Bitcoin is trading just below its all-time high, but has already faced several failed moves above this barrier. Over the past month, price has hovered near resistance, yet hasn\u2019t delivered a confirmed breakout. During this period, altcoins have struggled, with many dropping between 10% and 50%, further highlighting Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance and traders&#8217; caution. While the setup looks bullish, risks remain. A proper breakout will require not just a brief wick above $110K, but a strong weekly close or at least two consecutive daily closes above resistance. Until then, it\u2019s wise to stay patient. Chasing before confirmation can lead to getting caught in a false breakout. Once Bitcoin breaks and holds above this level, the probability of a larger move increases significantly. In the meantime, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to hold near highs while absorbing macro volatility and altcoin weakness is a strong sign of underlying demand. Momentum is building\u2014but timing matters. A confirmed breakout will be the signal that the next leg up is ready to begin. Until then, smart traders are watching and waiting. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel \u2013 Next Move Could Be Parabolic BTC Weekly Chart Shows Strong Structure Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,319 on the weekly chart, continuing to hover just below the crucial $109,300 resistance level. Despite multiple attempts, BTC has failed to close a weekly candle above this zone\u2014a critical milestone needed to confirm a breakout and signal the next phase of upward momentum. The $103,600 level now serves as strong weekly support, holding firm through recent pullbacks. The long-term structure remains bullish. Price continues to trend above all major moving averages, including the 50-week SMA ($85,147), the 100-week SMA ($66,505), and the 200-week SMA ($49,239), all of which are sloping upward. This alignment reflects solid long-term strength, even as Bitcoin consolidates just below all-time highs. Volume, however, remains relatively muted compared to the breakout seen in late 2024, suggesting that traders are waiting for confirmation before committing to new positions. Until BTC can close a weekly candle above $109,300, this range will remain intact.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-sees-269m-in-net-inflows-in-24h-bullish-momentum-accelerates/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is facing a crucial test as bulls and bears lock into a tight battle around the $2,500 level. Despite repeated attempts, bulls have yet to establish control above this key resistance, while bears have been unable to push the price to new lows, signaling an indecisive but increasingly tense standoff. This price compression comes at a time when broader market sentiment is shifting. The US stock market has just reached a new all-time high, and analysts believe crypto could be next to follow. Related Reading: ONDO Breaks Out Of Ascending Channel \u2013 Analyst Sets $0.29 Target Fueling that optimism is fresh data from Artemis showing that Ethereum recorded over $269 million in net inflows in the past 24 hours. This sharp increase in capital moving into ETH reflects renewed investor confidence and may act as a catalyst for further price action. As global liquidity trends upward and risk appetite returns, Ethereum continues to gain momentum. Still, the $2,500 level remains a major hurdle. A confirmed breakout above it could trigger a sharp move higher, potentially leading the way for altcoin recovery. Until then, ETH traders remain on alert, watching for either a clean breakout or another rejection in what could be a defining moment for Ethereum\u2019s mid-term direction. Ethereum Builds Strength As Altseason Awaits Breakout Ethereum has been consolidating in a broad range, trading between $2,200 and $2,800 for several weeks. This tight band of price action reflects a broader indecisiveness across the altcoin market, with traders still waiting for a definitive breakout to kickstart the long-anticipated altseason. Despite occasional surges in momentum, ETH has yet to break above the $2,800 mark\u2014a level that could open the door for sustained upside and renewed altcoin activity across the board. The macroeconomic environment remains a wildcard. With mixed inflation data, geopolitical risks, and a volatile interest rate outlook, markets are reacting cautiously. Yet, amid this backdrop, Ethereum continues to show resilience. Many analysts believe that once ETH breaks out of this range, it could act as the trigger for a broader altcoin rally. Adding to the bullish outlook is fresh data shared by top analyst Ted Pillows, who highlighted a significant shift in investor behavior. According to Pillows, Ethereum saw over $269 million in net inflows in the last 24 hours, signaling renewed demand from institutional and retail players alike. These inflows, tracked by Artemis, point to growing confidence and could serve as the foundation for Ethereum\u2019s next leg higher. While uncertainty lingers, momentum is quietly building. Ethereum\u2019s ability to hold above $2,200 and attract capital during macro headwinds suggests strength beneath the surface. For altseason to truly ignite, ETH must break out of its current range and push decisively into higher territory. Until then, traders and investors continue to watch closely, knowing that once the breakout happens, it could shift the entire market cycle forward. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Long-Term Channel \u2013 Next Move Could Be Parabolic ETH Consolidates Below 200-Day SMA Ethereum is currently trading at $2,427, consolidating below the key 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,544. After bouncing off support near $2,200 earlier this month, ETH has managed to hold above the 100-day SMA ($2,167) and regain some structure. However, the price remains capped by a cluster of resistance levels, including the 50-day SMA ($2,534) and the 200-day SMA, both of which are converging near $2,540\u2014a critical zone for bulls to reclaim. The chart shows that Ethereum has been trading within a broad range between $2,200 and $2,800 for several weeks, reflecting indecision in the market. The failure to break through the $2,800 zone earlier in June has kept ETH in a sideways pattern. Volume has also declined, suggesting caution among traders as ETH tests this tight band of resistance.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-double-bottom-rally/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin appears to be in the midst of a quiet accumulation phase, with a technical setup that may soon shift market sentiment. As highlighted by Crypto Man MAB, a double bottom pattern is taking shape on the weekly chart \u2014 a structure often associated with strong trend reversals. Structure Aligns With Sentiment: Is Dogecoin Poised For A Comeback? According to Crypto Man MAB in a recent post on X, Dogecoin appears to be setting the stage for a potential upward move, with a classic double-bottom pattern taking shape on the weekly chart. This pattern, often seen as a signal of a bullish reversal, has caught the attention of traders who are closely watching for confirmation. The current chart structure suggests that Dogecoin could be gearing up for a significant trend shift, provided the conditions align in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Spot Dogecoin ETF Gains SEC Traction\u2014Is A Price Surge Next? At the center of this formation is the key support level at $0.142, which Crypto Man MAB emphasized as being critical to the potential breakout. This level was previously tested and held by bulls back in April 2025, demonstrating its strength as a defensive zone. If the support holds and bullish momentum continues to build, Crypto Man MAB pointed out that the next major focus will be on the neckline resistance around $0.26. A successful breakout above this point could validate the double-bottom pattern and open the door for a rally toward the $0.47 target. Downtrend Fatigue Sets In\u2014Will The Bulls Take Over? Crypto Man MAB further noted that the ADX indicator, which is currently trending downward, signals a weakening of the recent downtrend from the neckline resistance. A slowdown in trend strength often precedes a shift in direction, and in this case, it supports the idea that Dogecoin could be preparing for a reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sets The Stage For A Liftoff With Key Reversal Pattern At the same time, attention has turned to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is hovering just below the neutral 50 level. While there are signs of increased buying interest, the RSI has yet to cross into bullish territory. Crypto Man MAB indicated that a decisive move above the 50 mark would significantly reinforce the bullish scenario, increasing the likelihood of a sustained rally. Until then, some sideways consolidation around the $0.142 support level remains possible. In conclusion, Crypto Man MAB believes Dogecoin is at a critical juncture, buoyed by market optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF. With both retail traders and larger investors (whales) accumulating at these levels, the stage is set for a possible breakout. Should current technical conditions improve and sentiment remain favorable, the path toward the $0.47 target could soon come into focus. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-coinbase-premium-positive-seven-weeks/",
      "summary": "The cryptocurrency market \u2014 specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 has performed quite well in the second quarter of 2025, which is a stark contrast to the first quarter&#8217;s performance. The premier cryptocurrency capitalized on this bullish momentum, jumping to a new all-time high above the $111,000 mark. Similarly, the price of Ethereum started its own resurgence and reclaimed the $2,000 mark in early May, albeit the altcoin has been stuck in a consolidation range over the past month. Despite the brewing market uncertainty due to the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to stay afloat. US Investors Keep Crypto Prices Afloat In a new post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that United States investors have been active in the market over the past few weeks. The crypto analyst explained that this correlates with the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices withstanding bearish pressure in recent weeks. Related Reading: You Won\u2019t Believe Who\u2019s Moving Millions in Bitcoin on Binance Right Now This on-chain observation is based on the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks the difference between the crypto prices on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and global Binance exchange (USDT pair). This metric reflects the sentiment of the US institutional entities (the major players on Coinbase) compared to those on global exchanges. Typically, when the price premium on Coinbase has a positive value, it implies increasing demand from US investors, who are willing to spend more than other global investors to buy cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum, in this case). On the flip side, the Coinbase Premium Index falling beneath the zero mark signals that US investors are buying less compared to the global traders. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index (excluding the abrupt dip in BTC on May 29) has been in the positive territory since May 9, 2024. This 47-day streak suggests high buying activity from US institutional investors despite geopolitical tensions. Kesmeci added: In the U.S., institutional investors and Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum ETF investors (except for Fidelity) continue their heavy purchases through Coinbase (and have been for weeks). This is why Coinbase Premiums are showing strong positive momentum. Because of this (in my opinion), despite the crises, we haven\u2019t seen a sharp drop in Bitcoin or Ethereum in the market. In essence, the on-chain analyst believes the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have been able to weather the storm with the rising tensions in Asia because US investors have been active in the market. Naturally, risk assets tend to succumb to bearish pressure during unstable conditions like wars, global pandemics, and so on. Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Price As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,100, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Ether token is valued at around $2,420, with a mere 0.6% price jump in the past day.
