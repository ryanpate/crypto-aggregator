      "summary": "Chainlink is set to play a major role as Hong Kong\u2019s central bank takes a big step in its digital currency tests. Phase two of the e-HKD pilot will try moving tokenized Hong Kong dollars across borders. The plan is to swap e-HKD for A$DC, an Australian dollar stablecoin. This could cut settlement times from days to seconds. It may also show how central banks can work together with blockchain technology. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Hong Kong And Australia Test Digital Cash According to reports, the project will use Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, or CCIP, to handle transfers. The goal is simple. Move money in real time and make sure both sides get what they expect. Phase two kicks off with Hong Kong authorities and their counterparts in Australia. They will swap e-HKD for A$DC and aim for instant settlement. Based on reports, this setup could serve as a model for other central banks. We\u2019re excited to share that Chainlink is facilitating the secure exchange of a Hong Kong CBDC and an Australian dollar stablecoin as part of an ongoing use case in Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program. Congratulations to participants @Visa, ANZ, China AMC, and Fidelity\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ts2C6Vt4Ul \u2014 Chainlink (@chainlink) June 9, 2025 Chainlink Tools In Use Chainlink is not just a name in the mix. It brings two big pieces of tech to the table. CCIP handles the cross-chain messages, acting like a bridge between different blockchains. The Digital Transfer Agent, or DTA, deals with compliance. It keeps track of who owns what token and makes sure rules in different countries are met. In May, World Liberty Financial tapped Chainlink for cross-chain stablecoin transfers covering USD1. That earlier deal hinted at what\u2019s possible this time around. Big Names Join The Pilot Visa and ANZ are helping with payment processing for e-HKD and A$DC. Asset managers Fidelity International and ChinaAMC will also take part. Their job is to manage the tokenized funds on both sides. This mix of banks, asset managers and tech firms shows the project is more than a small test. It has real money and real risks involved. Reports disclosed that those risks are managed by a Payment-versus-Payment model. This means funds are only released when both sides confirm they have received the other asset. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Market Moves And Reactions LINK, the token for Chainlink, jumped by 6% after news of the pilot broke. It now trades at $14.70. That rise follows a wider market rally driven by hopes that Bitcoin may hit $110,000 before the week\u2019s end. According to market data, crypto traders often chase big targets. Short-term gains can be tempting. But they can also lead to quick sell-offs if the main story fades. Despite the rally, Bitcoin still tracks the equity swings rather closely. There is a mix of bulls and bears in futures data that suggests some people are not yet convinced this run will last. High volatility can shake out weaker hands at the first sign of trouble. A sudden change in risk sentiment or a fresh macro shock can quickly reverse gains.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-liftoff-break-this-barrier-key-price-targets/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin skidded to a low near $0.168 last week before snapping higher to trade around $0.19 on Tuesday morning, up roughly six percent over 24 hours. The rebound unfolded in lock-step with bitcoin\u2019s own recovery from the technically charged $106,800 level to just above $109,000, re-invigorating short-term dip-buyers across the memecoin complex. Dogecoin Needs To Conquer This Price Level Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) argues that the Fib defence has restored bullish structure\u2014but only up to a point. \u201cAfter coming down to the .382 Fib Dogecoin finally found the support it needed along with BTC finding support at 100K,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs it goes for the immediate future of **DOGE it has a lot of work to do. Big resistance at .19-.21 cent range will need to be broken in order to head back up to that .26-.28 level. Indicators on the daily time frame look bullish.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s behaviour therefore remains pivotal. Spot BTC is hovering near $109,000 this morning and has so far defended the $106,800 pivot flagged by several high-profile analysts, including Michael van de Poppe, as the \u201clinchpin for a potential rally\u201d. Should Bitcoin extend toward the $120,000-$130,000 band, Kevin argues that Dogecoin will decouple from its dependence on the benchmark \u201cwhen dominance tops and the market sniffs out easing monetary policy.\u201d Crypto pundit Chandler (\u201c@ChandlerCharts\u201d) is less sanguine. Overlaying DOGE\u2019s four-day price against DOGE/BTC, market cap and a relative-strength oscillator, his graphic highlights three prior compression phases\u2014shaded grey\u2014where the memecoin failed to sustain outperformance against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive \u201cEven if DOGE breaks above its November highs, it won\u2019t feel great if DOGE/BTC ends up way lower than it was at the November highs,\u201d he cautioned. Chandler calculates that with BTC at $107,600, Dogecoin would have to print roughly $0.52 simply to reach a higher high against Bitcoin. \u201cIf BTC runs to $120-130k, DOGE needs to be around $0.60+ for holding DOGE to make sense over BTC.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The \u2018Next Impulse\u2019, Analyst Predicts That threshold underscores the importance of the $0.19-$0.21 supply zone visible on both analysts\u2019 charts. On Kevin\u2019s canvas it coincides with the 0.618-0.703 Fib cluster; on Chandler\u2019s, it overlaps the upper edge of an eighteen-month value area that has repeatedly rejected upside probes. A decisive close above $0.211 would place the May 11 summit at $0.2597 back in play and, more importantly for bulls. For now, traders are watching two numbers: $106,800 on Bitcoin and $0.21 on Dogecoin. A clean break of the latter would validate Kevin\u2019s bullish roadmap toward $0.26-$0.28 and, by extension, keep alive the possibility of Chandler\u2019s higher-high scenario on the DOGE/BTC cross. Until then, the memecoin\u2019s fate indeed \u201cremains in the hands of BTC\u2019s capability in heading higher.\u201d At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet has raised the possibility of the Ethereum price surging by 38% soon. He alluded to the 50EMA as the only thing holding ETH from witnessing this price surge, but suggested that it could change soon with a breakout on the horizon. Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that the Ethereum price could record a 38% surge to $3,500. This came following as he highlighted the ongoing battle between ETH and the 50EMA, noting that this indicator was the only thing holding the altcoin back from a parabolic surge. The analyst added that on average, a breakout results in a 38% pump, which puts Ethereum exactly at $3,500. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric As reported, Crypto Bullet also recently predicted that the Ethereum price could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern formed. Back then, he noted that ETH was facing tough resistance at $2,500 but affirmed that the resistance would be broken in due time. He indicated that a breakout from that resistance will usher in the rally to $3,300. The Ethereum price has now broken above the $2,500 resistance, which provides a bullish outlook for the largest altcoin by market cap. Based on Crypto Bullet\u2019s prediction, a rally to $3,300 may already be underway, which could then lead ETH to the $3,500 target. In a more recent X post, the crypto analyst commented on the recent break above $2,500. He stated that the Ethereum price is now trying to break the 200-day MA, which is between $3,000 and $3,300, for the fifth time. He indicated that a breakout above the range is likely to happen on this fifth attempt. His accompanying showed that ETH could rally to the $4,000 level if a successful breakout occurs. ETH About To Begin A New Bull Run Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted that another bull run is about to start for the Ethereum price. He noted that ETH\u2019s daily candle closed above the resistance level at $2,650 yesterday and also opened above this resistance level today. The analyst added that ETH is now moving above it, which signals the start of a new bull run. Related Reading: FTX Repayments About To Dump $5B On The Market, How Will Bitcoin And Ethereum React?

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price shook off last week\u2019s dip and climbed sharply on Tuesday morning in Asia, topping $110,000 briefly before settling around $109,450. Traders rushed back in after the asset dipped close to $100,000, feeding a sharp rebound that leaves Bitcoin just 2.8% shy of its record high. A blend of forced liquidations, surging derivatives volume, easing US\u2013China trade tensions and steady on-chain withdrawals is driving the move. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Heavy Liquidations Shift The Balance According to Coinglass, nearly $203 million in Bitcoin positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours. Of that, $195 million were against shorts. When so many short bets unwind at once, it forces buyers to cover positions, which can send prices spiking. Yet history shows these \u201cshort squeezes\u201d can reverse quickly when traders take profits. Based on reports, Bitcoin\u2019s derivatives volume more than doubled, climbing over 110% to $110 billion. Open interest then followed suit, expanding 7.3% to almost $77 billion. These kinds of inflows indicate that new money is accumulating. Both open interest and volume rising tends to indicate enthusiasm\u2014and a willingness to carry through positions with swings. Trade Diplomacy Lifts Risk Assets Talks resumed in London on June 9 between the US and China over tariffs and export rules. Even a hint of progress tends to boost appetite for riskier assets, and Bitcoin isn\u2019t immune. Headlines of smoother trade ties lifted equities earlier this week\u2014and crypto traders moved in tandem. If negotiations hit a snag, though, Bitcoin could slide with global markets. On-Chain Data Shows Steady Accumulation CryptoQuant\u2019s numbers reveal that centralized exchanges have shed 550,000 BTC since July 2024, falling from 1.55 million to about 1.01 million today. As coins leave exchanges, float tightens. At the same time, the Coinbase Premium indicator rose, with US buyers paying more than overseas investors. Santiment also reports renewed accumulation among wallets holding 10\u2013100 BTC. This pattern hints at long-term holding rather than quick trades. Related Reading: Ignore The Trump\u2013Musk Noise: Bitcoin\u2019s Backbone Stays Solid Correlation And Caution Remain When you consider the rally, Bitcoin still dances on the tunes of equity price swings. Futures have mixed bets between bulls and bears, showing portrait-wise signs that certainly not everybody is convinced this run is going to hold. High volatility would tend to wash out weak hands at the slightest hint of trouble, any reversal of risk sentiment, or a sudden macro shock would cost the rally dearly. Optimism is building as analysts talk of fresh all-time highs. Some even eye $150,000 by the end of the year if US debt levels climb further. But sustaining a rally of that magnitude will require more than forced liquidations. Traders will watch derivatives flows, on-chain reserves and trade headlines for signs of real, lasting demand before pushing prices much higher. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-eyes-2-50-decision-zone-macro-wave-structure/",
      "summary": "XRP changed hands at roughly $2.30 in early European trading on Tuesday, extending a two-day bounce that has pulled the token back toward the upper half of the seven-month range that has confined it between about $2.00 and $2.80 since December. Analyst Quantum Ascend argues that this compression phase is now approaching a technical fulcrum that will determine whether the next move is an impulsive wave-three surge or one final wave-two washout. XRP Tightens Into Decision Zone In a video posted on 9 June, the trader noted that \u201cwe\u2019ve been in this range\u2026 since early December\u2026 between like $2.80 and $2.00 just bouncing the whole time,\u201d before zooming out to show what he calls the only Elliott-wave count that \u201cmakes sense\u201d: a completed five-wave advance from last year\u2019s lows followed by a five-wave corrective pull-back. \u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at a one-two-three-four-five on the way down\u2026 that\u2019s the macro two\u2026 and now we\u2019re waiting on three-four-five,\u201d he said, adding that XRP still represents about 12.5% of his portfolio despite his tactical rotation into \u201calts with more gas left.\u201d Quantum Ascend\u2019s Fibonacci mapping reveals that the token has already retraced slightly more than 50% of its preceding leg higher\u2014a textbook depth for a second-wave correction\u2014and that the sell-off bottomed in the price region that coincided with the fourth wave of the prior move. \u201cMakes sense, perfect spot for us to bounce,\u201d he told viewers after plotting the swing low against the 0.5 Fib level. Related Reading: XRP Bull Trap Incoming? Analyst Sees $2.40 Fakeout Before Painful Crash Whether that bounce blossoms into a sustained breakout, he stressed, ultimately hinges on the market leader: \u201cI think Bitcoin\u2019s gonna make the decision for us,\u201d he said, pointing out that XRP\u2019s fate remains tightly coupled to any directional conviction in BTC. Bitcoin\u2019s own advance toward key retracement resistance could, in his view, drag major altcoins\u2014including XRP\u2014into their respective inflection zones. The analyst now fixes on the 0.618\u20130.786 Fib band, which corresponds to $2.42\u2013$2.52, as the \u201cdecision zone.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be an area that we gotta be careful of\u2026 statistically it\u2019s the area we\u2019re most probable to roll over\u2026 between $2.42 and $2.52,\u201d he warned, outlining the risk that XRP forms an A-B-C zig-zag and revisits lower supports before the larger impulsive leg begins. A rejection there would map onto the classical script of a complex second wave that fakes out early longs one final time before relinquishing control to bulls. Related Reading: XRP Price Remains Bullish Above $2, This Falling Channel Says $3.8 Is Coming Macro currents may soon add fuel. XRP\u2019s next potential volatility catalyst is the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s 17 June deadline on Franklin Templeton\u2019s spot-XRP exchange-traded fund proposal\u2014a ruling some desks see as the token\u2019s analogue to January\u2019s Bitcoin ETF moment. While ETF speculation has helped price reclaim higher ground this month, XRP remains almost a dollar below its January all-time high of $3.40, leaving the $2.42\u2013$2.52 pocket as the most technically significant hurdle in the short term. For now, traders will watch whether the current advance can print a daily close inside\u2014or better, above\u2014that corridor. A clean break would validate Quantum Ascend\u2019s wave-three thesis and open the charts to measured moves targeting the mid-$3s. Failure, by contrast, risks a final capitulation toward the lower-$2 region before the larger bull structure can re-assert itself. Whatever the outcome, the analyst remains sanguine: \u201cWhether it rolls over here one more time and we have to be patient or it just goes\u2014that\u2019s okay, because either way the end result is going to be the same.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.28.
