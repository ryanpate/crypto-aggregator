      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/chainlink-news/chainlink-consolidates-above-key-support-bulls-eye-20-range/",
      "summary": "Chainlink (LINK) has been locked in a consolidation phase since early March, following a prolonged period of bearish price action that began to lose momentum. Since then, the token has ranged sideways with notable volatility, reflecting broader uncertainty across the altcoin market. However, as Bitcoin pushes toward its all-time high and market sentiment turns increasingly bullish, analysts believe a decisive move from LINK may be imminent. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance \u2013 Bulls Target $97.10 Level Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights pointing to a key support level that could determine Chainlink\u2019s short-term trajectory. According to Martinez, LINK holding above the $12 mark is crucial and could serve as the launchpad for a breakout toward the $18\u2013$20 range. This level has acted as a major pivot in the past, and reclaiming it with strength would likely attract fresh buying pressure. With Bitcoin dominance remaining high and capital rotating selectively into altcoins, Chainlink\u2019s upcoming moves could signal a higher altcoin market direction. Investors and traders are closely watching this consolidation, waiting for a breakout that could kickstart the next leg higher for LINK and potentially confirm the beginning of a stronger altcoin cycle. The coming days could be critical in determining whether Chainlink is ready to rejoin the uptrend. Chainlink Builds Momentum Chainlink has seen a strong resurgence over the past two weeks, gaining more than 22% in value since June 22. After months of consolidation and sideways action, the recent price movement suggests that bullish momentum is returning to the altcoin. The broader market environment is improving, with Bitcoin nearing its all-time high and risk appetite gradually increasing across crypto assets. For Chainlink, this has translated into renewed optimism and a growing expectation of a breakout. Fundamentally, Chainlink remains one of the most important infrastructure projects in the crypto space. Its partnerships with high-profile projects such as Ripple and Ondo Finance highlight its crucial role in powering real-world asset tokenization and secure on-chain data feeds. These integrations support long-term utility and demand, reinforcing investor confidence in the project\u2019s future. Ali Martinez emphasized that holding above the $12 level is key for Chainlink. According to his analysis, sustained price action above this zone could pave the way for a breakout toward the $18\u2013$20 range. Historically, LINK has shown strong impulsive moves after breaking major consolidation zones, and the current structure appears similar. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility \u2013 $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum LINK Consolidates Below Resistance Chainlink is currently trading at $13.32 after facing a minor rejection from the $14 zone. The chart shows that LINK remains in a consolidation range that began in early March, with price action confined between the $12.20 and $14.50 levels. The token has made multiple attempts to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which now sit just above the current price action. These moving averages, along with horizontal resistance around $14, are acting as a strong ceiling for now. Despite the recent pullback, LINK remains structurally bullish on the mid-term as it prints higher lows since the June bottom near $11. Analysts remain optimistic that a decisive close above $14\u2013$14.50 would invalidate this range and pave the way for a push toward the $16\u2013$18 zone. Related Reading: Tron DeFi Activity Expands: SunSwap Hits $3B+ Monthly Swaps In 2025 The 200-day moving average near $16.77 remains a key target in the event of a breakout. However, failure to reclaim $14 could lead to another test of support around $12. Overall, the setup remains constructive but will require renewed bullish momentum\u2014possibly led by Bitcoin strength or positive ecosystem news\u2014for a breakout confirmation. Until then, LINK continues to oscillate in a tight range, with bulls watching closely. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/snaky-way-explodes-into-presale/",
      "summary": "The cryptocurrency landscape is always evolving, with new projects popping up to capture the attention of investors, whether they are utility or meme-based. Among the latest entrants, Snaky Way ($AKE) is quickly making headlines with its explosive presale, standing out as not just another meme coin. The token backs a meticulously designed ecosystem aiming to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3. To do this, the project employs an innovative approach, combining AI, engaging blockchain gaming, and strategic partnerships with mainstream influencers. Today, the ICO has soared past the $160K fundraising mark. A New Approach to Web3 Adoption While many new meme coins primarily target the existing crypto audience, $AKE is targeting newcomers. It has a mission: to onboard mainstream users into the world of Web3. The project is doing its best to ensure its token is accessible, and uses familiar engagement models to promote a sense of comfort. At its heart is a charming green snake mascot that fronts the project, combining entertainment with practical utility. Snaky Way dismantles the traditional barriers to crypto adoption \u2013 complex interfaces, gatekeeping communities, and technical jargon. Instead of focusing on existing crypto circles for outreach, the team aims to collaborate with popular, mainstream influencers across social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. The strategic partnerships are designed to bring new audiences to crypto through intuitive gaming experiences and tournaments. Furthermore, its multi-chain infrastructure, being across all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, and with plans to integrate with Solana, significantly lowers the technical hurdles sometimes faced by newcomers. The token will be compatible with a broad range of beginner-friendly crypto wallets, allowing anyone to interface with simplicity while learning about blockchain technology. Unpacking the Technological Edge Snaky Way ($AKE) uses an AI-Powered Market Maker System. This system will use AI algorithms to execute strategic buybacks, actively working to maintain the token\u2019s price stability even during market volatility. By analyzing real-time trading patterns, volume data, and sentiment indicators, the AI picks the best time to buy, preventing sudden price crashes and supporting gradual value appreciation over time, thus providing a layer of confidence for investors. Beyond its AI, Snaky Way is growing a vibrant gaming platform complete with a tournament structure. Let&#8217;s face it, we all love good competition. The project developers are working on a dedicated game featuring the project\u2019s snake mascot; it will be incorporating Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics that reward players with $AKE tokens. The regular tournament will offer substantial prizes and feature appearances from celebrities and crypto personalities. Top players will also see their names showcased on a leaderboard. The higher you score, the better the reward. Aiming for viral content opportunities, Snaky Way wants to foster genuine community engagement via competition and expand its reach beyond the normal crypto circles. How to Join the Trending Presale The Snaky Way ($AKE) presale is well underway, having already secured over $160K from early investors. Note the presale is set up over a tiered pricing system, meaning the earlier you get in, the more you potentially see in return over time. Right now, you can buy $AKE for $0.0000932 and stake your tokens for an APR of 15,840%. The early-stage pricing presents an attractive opportunity for initial investors, offering potential substantial returns before the token gets listed on CEXs and DEXs. As a presale member, you also get immediate access to the high-yield staking platform, allowing you to accumulate rewards before the official launch. This staking amplifies the potential return over time and adds value beyond what you\u2019ve already bought during the presale. To join in, you can connect any Ethereum-compatible wallet, like Best Wallet, to the presale widget. You can then pay using either $ETH, $USDT, or fiat, and secure your tokens in just a couple of minutes. You\u2019ll get to claim your crypto once the presale ends. Remember, this is not financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments."

Some snapped up coins at $150, betting that the whale\u2019s shift in assets hinted at a larger play. Others took profits as the price crossed that round number, locking in gains. Either way, breaking above $150 marked a clear sign that short\u2011term momentum was back. It even pulled in fresh players looking for quick wins. US\u2011Listed Solana ETF Gains Traction On the same day, a new staking\u2011enabled Solana ETF went live on Cboe BZX. It started with $33 million in trades on its very first session. That outpaced many earlier crypto futures products, pushing more faith into SOL as an investment option. Based on reports, traditional investors who were on the fence now had a regulated path to add Solana to their portfolios without jumping through extra hoops. This double whammy\u2014whale wallet shuffle and a fresh ETF\u2014did more than bake a rally; it gave the market two clear signals. First, smart money still moves big chunks behind the scenes.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/1-dogecoin-dream-chartist-parabolic-scenario/",
      "summary": "The improbable $1 price target for Dogecoin has returned to the spotlight after independent crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) shared a bold new Ichimoku-based projection on July 3. In a chart posted to X, the analyst outlined a parabolic price trajectory for DOGE using 2-week candles, suggesting that the memecoin could begin an explosive ascent in late 2025, eventually reaching the symbolic one-dollar mark. The $1 Dogecoin Dream The projection rests on DOGE\u2019s ability to maintain current bullish structure above the Ichimoku cloud, with a brief retest later this year during liftoff. \u201cDOGE 2-week candles, Ichimoku cloud shown. Why am I buying doge? Because I\u2019m delusional and this is what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d the trader wrote, pairing tongue-in-cheek self-awareness with conviction in a longer-term breakout scenario. At the time of the chart\u2019s publication, Dogecoin was trading at $0.172, up nearly 14% on the fortnight. The price action shows a clean bounce off the top of the green Ichimoku cloud, suggesting that DOGE is holding bullish structure on a high timeframe, a key technical criterion in Ichimoku trend-following theory. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst\u2014Here\u2019s The Target The Ichimoku Cloud (Kumo) on the 2-week timeframe, calculated with the traditional 9/26/52/26 settings, shows the Leading Span A (Senkou A) currently above Leading Span B (Senkou B), forming a green cloud\u2014indicative of a bullish trend outlook. DOGE\u2019s price is above the cloud, which acts as dynamic support. This is critical: Ichimoku practitioners consider price above the cloud to be in a bullish regime, especially on higher timeframes. The analyst\u2019s hand-drawn black curve on the chart begins near $0.17 and initially curves downward, touching the upper boundary of the Kumo in the near future, likely near the $0.15\u20130.16 zone. This suggests an expected retest of the cloud support, a common setup in trend continuation trades. Rather than projecting a breakdown, the curve depicts this contact as a springboard for a rapid vertical rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under $0.20 \u2018Is Free,\u2019 Says Analyst\u2014Predicts 2,000% Upside Once the price completes its cloud retest, the trajectory steepens dramatically, punching through overhead resistance near $0.29\u2014the approximate flat Kijun-sen level\u2014then continuing past prior 2024 highs. The final stretch of the curve accelerates toward the $1 level sometime in 2026, consistent with the behavior seen in prior memecoin mania phases. Interestingly, Cantonese Cat\u2019s conviction comes despite several bearish near-term signals. Just two days prior to publishing the chart, the analyst wrote: \u201cDOGE closed the month below the 20-month SMA, with a bearish engulfing candle! I would care if the volume wasn\u2019t so pathetic\u2026\u201d That statement acknowledged structural weakness but dismissed it on the basis of low participation, hinting that sellers lacked conviction. The same day, the trader disclosed renewed entries into DOGE and Avalanche, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it right, but I bought AVAX and DOGE again this morning.\u201d Broader Context DOGE\u2019s memetic status makes it particularly susceptible to sentiment shifts, and it remains uncorrelated to fundamentals in the traditional sense. Still, in the 2021 and 2024 bull markets, DOGE served as a proxy for retail risk appetite, often outperforming once attention rotated from majors like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The green cloud forecast and the rising trajectory into 2026 may reflect not just technical setups, but a broader cyclical expectation: that another wave of liquidity, speculative mania, or cultural relevance could return DOGE to the spotlight. For now, however, the price must hold the cloud before the market can validate this roadmap. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1678. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says",

      "summary": "The wait for altcoin season continues as the crypto market is still showing signs of bearish movement. Expectations are high that the altcoin market will begin to rally soon, but not everyone is optimistic that the altcoin season is coming. One of those is market analyst and expert Stockmoney Lizards, who has said that it is not happening soon. Altcoin Season Is Not Happening Soon In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Stockmoney Lizards informed their over 160,000 followers that the altcoin season could not be happening anytime soon. The analyst said that it is \u201cnot even remotely close\u201d, pointing to the rising Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin season is still far off. Related Reading: Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement Analyzing the chart, the market expert explains that despite the Bitcoin dominance having fallen by around 2%, it still doesn\u2019t mean much. This is because the dominance is still very strong and continues to trade inside the channel. This channel also charts a possible increase in the Bitcoin dominance from here, which would be detrimental for altcoins. So far, the Bitcoin dominance has also managed to hold above 65%. While this is not the highest it has ever been, it is still incredibly high, with previous altcoin seasons not happening until the dominance had fallen toward 40%. The analyst doesn\u2019t entirely rule out the possibility of an altcoin season, saying it will still come. However, for now, Bitcoin continues to dominate, as he explains that \u201cBTC is the measure of all things.\u201d Altcoin Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels As the Bitcoin dominance has risen and the altcoin dominance has fallen, they have gone toward levels not seen in years. For example, the last time the Bitcoin dominance was above 65% was back in 2021 before it crashed to usher in the altcoin season, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: AI Founder Puts XRP Price As High As $20-$30 Even worse is the Ethereum dominance, which has dropped to 5-year lows. Sitting at only 8%, it is now at levels recorded back in 2020 before the market rebounded from the COVID-19 crash. This has greatly diminished Ethereum\u2019s ability to pull the altcoin market up with it. In the same vein, the altcoin dominance, excluding Ethereum, has now dropped to 26%. The last time that the OTHERS dominance was this low was in 2021. However, this was right around when the altcoin season was starting, suggesting that the current market could be at the cusp of another altcoin run. Nevertheless, for there to be any sustainable altcoin season, the Bitcoin dominance must first crash. Going by what happened back in 2017 and 2021, at least a 40% crash in the Bitcoin dominance is required to usher in the altcoin season. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView.com"
