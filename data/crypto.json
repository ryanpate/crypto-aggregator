      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-could-rise-3x-to-300000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has continued to hover above the $100,000 mark over the past few days, and its price action has stabilized around $105,000 in the wake of recent market tensions and despite inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. A new analysis shared by crypto market commentator Gert van Lagen suggests that this current phase is going to precede an explosive move similar to those seen in previous market cycles. Backing his prediction with historical data and Glassnode\u2019s AVIV Ratio chart, the analyst noted that the current on-chain structure echoes moments before Bitcoin\u2019s major rallies in past bull markets. AVIV Ratio Flashes Familiar Pattern Before Market Top Bitcoin&#8217;s price volatility has slightly cooled since the initial surge to a new all-time high above $111,800 in May, and the latest candlestick structure suggests it may be preparing for another leg higher. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? Taking to the social media platform X, Gert van Lagen revealed a Bitcoin price prediction that centers around the true market Deviation metric known as the AVIV Ratio. This orange-colored line on the chart tracks a specific deviation in Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior and has always crossed a red line denoting +3 standard deviations at or just before cycle tops. The current AVIV behavior can be compared to previous price points before market tops in previous cycles. For instance, in 2013, the AVIV Ratio flagged a major rally when Bitcoin was trading near $200, shortly before the price pushed past $1,200. In 2017, the metric behaved similarly when Bitcoin was trading at $3,700 and later peaked near $20,000. The current AVIV Ratio can also be compared to when Bitcoin was priced at $13,000 in the 2021 bull market run, before its surge to an all-time high of $69,000. According to the analyst, today\u2019s AVIV ratio level is closely aligned with those previous mid-cycle breakouts. The current ratio has not yet crossed the red +3\u03c3 line, which the analyst refers to as the cycle top trigger. As such, its current reading suggests Bitcoin may be in the early phase of a major bull market expansion. If history repeats itself, a 3x move from today\u2019s levels would be a standard price move in line with previous price action. $300,000 Target Within Sight If AVIV Behavior Holds Crypto analyst van Lagen stops short of calling for an immediate top, but his analysis implies that Bitcoin could be preparing for a new parabolic surge to the upside. Using the AVIV model as a reference, a conservative 3x multiplier on the current Bitcoin price places a possible target around $300,000.

      "summary": "As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to impact cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin (BTC) recently dipping below the $105,000 mark, market analyst VirtualBacon has shared insights suggesting that altcoins are gearing up for a potentially robust summer. Emerging AI Memecoins In a recent update on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), he highlighted several promising developments within the altcoin space. VirtualBacon pointed to an emerging wave of AI-focused Layer-1 blockchain projects, many backed by prominent figures in both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. He mentioned several names to watch, including Sahara Labs, Sentient AGI, and Gaianet, among others. While these projects have yet to release tokens, many are expected to conduct airdrops or early access rounds, presenting opportunities for early investors. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge For those seeking \u201chigher-risk, high-reward investments,\u201d VirtualBacon noted the impressive performance of artificial intelligence (AI) agent memecoins. He cited the launch of IRIS, which skyrocketed from a $220,000 fully diluted valuation (FDV) to $120 million, representing a 600x return. Platforms such as Virtuals, CreatorBid, and SeedifyFund are turning user engagement into allocation opportunities, likening this phenomenon to a form of airdrop farming on steroids. In addition, VirtualBacon highlighted a relatively overlooked area: Bittensor subnet tokens. He mentioned that seasoned investors can now acquire early-stage subnets directly on Bittensor\u2019s chain, with projects like SN65_TPN and inference_labs raising capital through token auctions at valuations below $4 million. Stablecoins Take Center Stage Turning to real-world assets (RWAs), VirtualBacon advised focusing on mid-cap infrastructure projects with tangible revenue streams. He pointed to CHEX and CPOOL, which has shown consistent upward movement, as examples of promising investments. Another emerging narrative is the merger and acquisition activity involving public companies and crypto projects. VirtualBacon noted that Tron is set to go public through a Nasdaq reverse merger, while Mixie has been acquired by Netcapital, which boasts a team that includes notable figures like Tim Draper and a co-founder of Helium. A particularly intriguing development is World Liberty Financial (WLF), co-founded by Eric and Donald Jr. Trump, which aims to become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With plans for its own stablecoin, USD1, and expected to launch in October, the token could have an estimated FDV of $10\u201315 billion, a conservative projection given its potential. VirtualBacon also pointed out that stablecoins are becoming central to macroeconomic strategies. Tether now ranks as the fifth-largest holder of US Treasuries, highlighting the increasing need for buyers in the market. The analyst urged investors to keep an eye on stablecoin projects that integrate artificial intelligence technology and yield generation, such as USD1, Circle\u2019s USDC, and others. Liquidity Shifts To Altcoin Platforms In the gaming sector, liquidity is coalescing around BlackholeDex, a decentralized exchange (DEX) backed by the AVAX Foundation. With a fee-sharing model similar to Aerodrome and Shadow, BlackholeDex has launched veNFT staking, aligning long-term incentives for users. Related Reading: Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come Lastly, in the Solana ecosystem, Saros DLMM is emerging as a strong competitor to existing platforms like Jupiter and Meteora, utilizing similar bucket-based liquidity pools but with lower fees. It also plans a RADY meme airdrop for SAROS stakers, which could attract early adopters and fuel rapid growth, thus closing the list of highlighted altcoins. As of this writing, Ethereum, the market\u2019s leading altcoin, is trading at $2,521. It has consolidated above this level after dropping sharply from its two-week high of $2,878.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/jpmorgan-launches-usd-deposit-token-not-stablecoin/",
      "summary": "After days of rumors around the identity of the mysterious \u2018JPMD\u2019 token filed by JPMorgan, widely supposed to be a stablecoin, the truth has finally emerged. JPMD isn\u2019t a stablecoin after all \u2013 it\u2019s a deposit token on the Base blockchain (Coinbase\u2019s own blockchain). With JPMD, institutions have a round-the-clock method of making deposits, incorporating established banking systems with blockchain technology. It\u2019s one more step along the path towards crypto as a normal part of everyday life, alongside core crypto projects like Best Wallet token. Time to learn more about why JPMorgan thinks deposit tokens are part of the future of crypto. Not a Surprise After All: JPMorgan Champions Deposit Tokens Perhaps everyone should have guessed what JPMD was. After all, one of the largest banks in the US is hardly likely to do anything without a lot of research and preparation. And in this case, JPMorgan has been championing blockchain-powered deposit tokens since at least 2022. That was when the company published an extensive report on the utility and function of proposed deposit tokens. Calling them \u2018a foundation for stable digital money,\u2019 JPMorgan outlined a number of core advantages a deposit token could offer to traditional banks: \u2714\ufe0f Digital form of commercial bank money \u2013 deposit token fills the role of existing deposit claims \u2714\ufe0f Blockchain-native programmability \u2013 with deposit tokens, banks can access smart contracts, an atomic settlement option, and automated processing \u2714\ufe0f Payment efficiency and cost reduction \u2013 on-chain deposit tokens provide real-time transfers; no more waiting for deposits to settle after-hours \u2714\ufe0f Seamless integration with banking \u2013 established use cases, existing support networks, and even clear legal status; there\u2019s little to prevent immediate use of deposit tokens within the current banking infrastructure That last point is critical. Even while stablecoins draw increased attention, deposit tokens like JPMD hold one clear advantage: they fit neatly into existing rules and regulations. Trademark Filed, JPMorgan Builds Base for Crypto-Finance Integration JPMorgan filed the trademark application on June 15, 2025. As it turns out, the deposit token will be built on the Base blockchain and will leverage that chain to provide round-the-clock crypto access for its clients (Coinbase is one). If JPMD takes off \u2013 and it should, since JPMorgan has a market cap of roughly $738B \u2013 it could be the next step in the growing conjunction between crypto and finance. Institutions have led crypto adoption in recent months, but there are growing signs that retail adoption won\u2019t be far behind. Success in a fully integrated crypto-financial world will rest partly on the power of your crypto wallet. Best Wallet app is a leading non-custodial crypto wallet, and now the Best Wallet Token launch takes the wallet to the next level. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) \u2013 Upgrade Your Crypto Wallet to be Future-Proof Best Wallet Token ($BEST) takes the power of the Best Wallet app up a notch. $BEST token holders gain: \u2705 Exclusive crypto presale access \u2705 Reduced trading fees \u2705 Increased staking rewards \u2705 Governance rights and participation Best Wallet is the only crypto presale wallet, offering an Upcoming Tokens feature where you can research and invest in the best crypto presales. It\u2019s all part of a growing crypto ecosystem where Best Wallet, Best Wallet Token, and the upcoming Best Card work together to equip you to navigate a brave new crypto world. That gives $BEST unique utility, even among other crypto presales. Currently, tokens cost $0.025195, and early investors can stake them for a 104% variable APY. Our price prediction sees the token price potentially reaching $0.035215 by the end of the year, delivering 40% returns to anyone who buys in now. Learn how to buy Best Wallet token, and don\u2019t forget to visit the Best Wallet Token presale page today. JPMorgan, Best Wallet Show Path Forward for Crypto Together, the launch of both $BEST and $JPMD highlights the way forward for crypto. Traditional finance and crypto are no longer separate things \u2013 they\u2019re two sides of the same coin, and crypto wallets connect them. Before purchasing $BEST, do your own research. This isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/researchers-forecast-bitcoin-at-4-3-million-by-2036-citing-institutional-demand/",
      "summary": "In a striking forecast, two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, have predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to an astonishing $4.3 million by 2036 if institutional buying trends continue. This prediction was highlighted by market expert Giovanni Incasa, who emphasized the significance of applying rigorous supply-demand theories to Bitcoin&#8217;s unique economic structure. Supply Shock Warning Rudd and Porter have employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin&#8217;s market dynamics, warning that the impending supply shock could lead to price fluctuations ten times more severe than anything seen to date. Their findings suggest that the effects of this supply shock will result in permanent wealth redistribution, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge According to their conservative estimates, the Bitcoin price could reach $2.2 million per coin by 2036, a projection rooted in what they describe as &#8220;economic physics.&#8221; The researchers note that the current liquid supply of Bitcoin stands at only 11.2 million coins, with an estimated 4 million Bitcoin lost forever due to lost keys and Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s unspent stash. Their analysis reveals that only half of BTC\u2019s total supply is actively liquid, meaning that even modest institutional purchases could lead to significant supply shortages. Evidence of this trend can be seen in the daily buying habits of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have averaged 285 Bitcoin per day since their launch, and the actions of Bitcoin treasury companies that are removing thousands of coins from circulation through debt financing. Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a strategic reserve of one million Bitcoin, which would involve an acquisition of approximately 550 coins per day over five years. The researchers calculate that if 2,000 Bitcoin are removed from circulation daily, the price could reach $106,000\u2014a figure that is already close to today&#8217;s trading price of $104,800, suggesting that their mathematical framework is holding true. The crux of the researchers&#8217; findings is that traditional supply curves are not applicable to BTC. Its perfectly inelastic supply creates significant bottlenecks as demand rises, leading to dramatic price increases. They emphasize that institutions that delay their investments risk becoming permanently priced out of the market. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Rudd and Porter outline three potential scenarios for Bitcoin&#8217;s future. In a conservative scenario, with a 20-fold increase in demand and continued institutional adoption leading to 2,000 daily Bitcoin withdrawals, prices could reach $2.2 million by 2036. Their bullish scenario posits a 30-fold demand growth, where Bitcoin could hit $5 million by early 2031. The most extreme, hyperbolic scenario anticipates a 40-fold demand increase, with daily withdrawals escalating to 4,000 Bitcoin, potentially driving prices to $4.3 million by 2036 and valuing Bitcoin at six times the current market cap of gold. Related Reading: Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come The implications of Rudd and Porter\u2019s research extend beyond mere speculation. It highlights a transformative period for BTC and the broader financial landscape, where strategic positioning and early adoption could mean the difference between thriving and merely surviving in the digital economy.
