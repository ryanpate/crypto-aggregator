      "summary": "In a livestream on June 15, crypto analyst Cantonese Cat delivered a firm verdict on XRP\u2019s prolonged consolidation: don\u2019t be fooled by the sideways drift. Despite trading in a tight range for over half a year, the chart veteran argued XRP is building energy for a powerful move, one that could take it as high as $6 to $8 once it breaks out of its multi-month technical cage. XRP To $8? \u201cThis thing has been going sideways for seven months,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the entire time, it\u2019s just hugging this GAN line.\u201d He referred to a long-standing monthly Gann arc structure that XRP has been grinding against since late 2024. In his interpretation, the repeated tests of that arc\u2014combined with price holding above key support zones\u2014signal strength rather than weakness. \u201cIt\u2019s just waiting for its thing,\u201d he added, implying that the eventual move could be sharp and sudden. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance Cantonese Cat highlighted that the current price action is sitting just beneath the next major Gann resistance level, which aligns closely with a Fibonacci extension target between $6 and $8. That arc, he believes, will be the trigger. \u201cI think the next level is going to end up breaking up to the GAN arc up above,\u201d he said, adding that a clean breach of this level could mark the start of XRP\u2019s long-awaited parabolic run. He also pulled up the monthly Ichimoku Cloud, pointing out that XRP had already broken above it\u2014a significant bullish milestone in Ichimoku analysis. \u201cInitially it had a rejection of the Ichimoku cloud,\u201d he explained, \u201cand now we have a true breakout.\u201d Most importantly, XRP has held the Tenkan and Kijun without falling back into the cloud. \u201cThis is basically a look of bullishness,\u201d he noted, citing the textbook structure of a confirmed trend reversal. The broader structure, according to his analysis, is a classic breakout setup: a horizontal level was cleared, back-tested, and is now serving as support. \u201cYou\u2019re basically breaking above a horizontal level here and back testing it. And so far, you\u2019re holding it pretty convincingly.\u201d To reinforce his thesis, he pointed to Fibonacci retracements\u2014specifically, XRP\u2019s behavior around the 0.86 level, which the asset has been flirting with. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to convincingly break above 0.86 here,\u201d he said, \u201cthen all-time high stuff could happen.\u201d Asked by viewers why the market isn\u2019t moving yet, he dismissed the apparent stagnation as noise. \u201cIt\u2019s just going sideways, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just waiting for its thing.\u201d In his view, the lack of momentum is not a sign of weakness, but rather a signal that XRP is compressing in a low-volatility zone\u2014a typical prelude to a high-volatility expansion. \u201cWhenever it decides to get done with this shenanigans,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s probably going to go up.\u201d Despite XRP\u2019s muted performance while other assets like Bitcoin and Solana have captured headlines, Cantonese Cat made clear that he sees no structural damage on the chart. Quite the opposite: he views the persistent adherence to long-term support levels, especially on the monthly timeframe, as an indication that XRP is simply coiling beneath resistance. Related Reading: XRP Has A 70% Shot To Beat Bitcoin, Says Analyst In a cycle increasingly defined by breakout-driven flows and rotational capital, he framed XRP\u2019s dormancy not as a failure, but as a delayed opportunity. \u201cStill holding the Tenkan and Kijun just fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what bullish looks like.\u201d The analyst didn\u2019t offer a date, but was blunt about the price levels to watch. If XRP clears the monthly Gann arc and maintains strength above the 0.86 Fibonacci zone, the $6\u2013$8 range comes into play\u2014levels that would not only exceed previous all-time highs, but also flip sentiment from apathy to euphoria in a matter of weeks. Until then, he warned, XRP\u2019s breakout might not announce itself loudly. But when it comes, few will be positioned. \u201cStill sleeping on XRP?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou might want to wake up soon.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.20 Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

That boost represents a 3.70% rise in their combined holdings. These so\u2011called whales and sharks now control over 41 million ETH, or about a quarter of all Ether in circulation.

The slow grind suggests neither buyers nor sellers have full conviction. Still, big holders continue to stack coins, waiting for the next catalyst. Rising Activity On Layer 2 And Services On\u2011chain data shows whales directing attention to specific services. Transaction volume in Ethereum Name Service jumped over 300% in the second week of July. Lending protocols on Ethereum saw a more than 200% rise. Meanwhile, transfers of USDC on layer 2 networks\u2014Base, Arbitrum and Optimism\u2014all posted triple\u2011digit gains. These numbers point to growing use of scaling layers and services beyond simple trading. Spot ETF Inflows Update Institutional interest has been strong too. US spot Ether products saw inflows for 19 straight days before a small pullback. That streak brought in $1.37 billion, mostly into BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust. On the day the run ended, the funds recorded just a little over $2 million in outflows. It\u2019s a minor wobble in what has so far been a solid embrace of Ether by big financial firms.

      "summary": "Cantonese Cat\u2019s first livestream in weeks, broadcast on 15 June, devoted an extended segment to Dogecoin\u2019s long-term structure\u2014and the veteran technician was unequivocal about the upside he still sees. In his words, \u201cthis is still a cup and this is still a handle,\u201d and if that formation completes he expects the meme-coin to break \u201canywhere from like $5 to $8.\u201d That target, he added, is anchored by the intersection of a monthly GAN arc and Fibonacci extensions that have governed Dogecoin\u2019s entire post-2020 advance. Dogecoin Price Could Hit $8 The analyst began by stripping the chart to its monthly timeframe and toggling off short-term clutter. He noted that Dogecoin has already tested the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud and, despite failing to \u201cpenetrate the monthly cloud\u201d on the first attempt, continues to coil beneath it. \u201cEven if it goes sideways for another month or two,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to enter the Ichimoku cloud one way or another\u2014you can either push up like that or you can just go sideways and you get inside the cloud.\u201d Under either scenario, the tenor remains constructive because the price is \u201cforming higher highs and higher lows.\u201d Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash \u2013 Here\u2019s The Rest Of The Forecast Central to his conviction is the 20-month simple moving average, a line he regards as the spine of every major Dogecoin bull cycle. During the manic run of early 2021, price action \u201crode the 20[-month SMA] up\u201d without once breaking it; when that moving average finally failed, the bear market ensued. Today, Dogecoin sits on top of the same level. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re able to use that as support,\u201d he argued, and that support zone\u2014currently just below the handle\u2014doubles as what he calls a \u201cbuy zone\u201d for long-horizon traders. The analyst himself \u201cwas buying more DOGE the last 4-5 days,\u201d he revealed via X. Cantonese Cat also addressed the coin\u2019s lethargy since April, insisting that the compression is constructive rather than dangerous. He pointed to the fact that Dogecoin is grinding just beneath the 0.5 log-scale retracement of the entire 2021\u20132022 decline, a behaviour he interprets as \u201cbuilding up some energy.\u201d The longer the coil, the sharper the eventual expansion, he argued, provided the higher-timeframe moving averages remain intact. Related Reading: Will Dogecoin Moon Or Crash? This Indicator Holds The Answer Pressed by viewers about timing, the analyst declined to publish a timetable and reminded his audience that the breakout will almost certainly coincide with a broader alt-season. He did, however, flag the moment price re-enters the Ichimoku cloud as the technical \u201cgreen light\u201d for acceleration. Once that happens, the measured-move objective from the cup-and-handle and the GAN arc intersection converge in the $5\u2013$8 zone\u2014levels that would represent new all-time highs and deliver returns of roughly 3,000\u20135,000 percent from current prices. \u201cAnything that\u2019s closer to the twenty-one moving average is a good area to add,\u201d he concluded, cautioning newcomers not to chase sudden green candles but to accumulate methodically while the chart remains \u201cboring.\u201d The implication is clear: Dogecoin\u2019s dormancy may be the final shakeout before the largest impulse of the cycle, and those ignoring the calm may indeed \u201cregret sleeping on this chart\u201d if\u2014and only if\u2014the structural signals Cantonese Cat tracks fall into place.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-primed-90000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price, while still holding above $100,000, has not exactly inspired confidence in the crypto community recently. This comes as the digital asset failed to break above new all-time highs during last week\u2019s rallies and, with the Israel-Iran conflict, saw a sharp plunge, erasing its weekly gains. Amid this, the bears have gained even more ground and are now more in control of the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Thus, the probability of a deep crash is heightened during this time. Bitcoin Price Could Crash Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, pseudonymous crypto analyst MIRZA has called for a possible Bitcoin price crash that could send the market spiraling even more. The crypto analyst points to the rising weakness of the Bitcoin price and the formation of bearish patterns on its price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions The first notable bearish development was the fact that the Bitcoin price had been unable to break above $111,000 despite coming close last week. Since this is where the resistance for the previous all-time high lies, it shows that there is still not enough strength in the digital asset to continue its ascent. The result of this was the decline that sent it back toward the $103,000 as bears took a stand once more. This bearish drop suggests that the asset is now forming a potential double top or a lower high structure. Both of this are bad signs for any asset as it suggests that the upward momentum has ended and there is nowhere to go but down. This change in momentum toward the negative suggests that there could be a liquidity grab at lower levels. The crypto analyst predicts that there is a possibility that the upward trend could continue if the Bitcoin price is able to break above $107,000 and maintain it. Otherwise, the Bitcoin price is expected to crash by more than 15%, pushing it below $90,000 and as low as $85,000 before a bottom is established. BTC Bearish Sentiment Grows MIRZA is not the only crypto analyst who has called a possible price crash for Bitcoin. RLinda, also took to the platform to share what she expects next for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. She points out that the Israel-Iran conflict was the reason that the Bitcoin price lost its bullish trend and was trending back downward at this point. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance However, Bitcoin continues to hold support above $100,000 so far, which has shown some strength. As a result, the analyst explains that the BTC price could end up ranging between $102,500 and $106,200 for a while as a result. The end of this, however, could end up going two ways. If Bitcoin breaks above $106,200, then it has a shot to rise above $110,000 again. However, if it loses the $102,500 support, then the next crash would send it toward $100,000 again.

Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $0.1880 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE declined below the $0.1800 and $0.1750 levels. The bears even pushed the price below the $0.1720 level. A low was formed at $0.1695 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2064 swing high to the $0.1697 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.180 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1760 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1760 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1785 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.180 level. A close above the $0.180 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1880 resistance. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2064 swing high to the $0.1697 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.200 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2120. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.180 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1720 level. The next major support is near the $0.1700 level. The main support sits at $0.1680. If there is a downside break below the $0.1680 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1550 level or even $0.1525 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.
