      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-on-the-way-to-4-ath/",
      "summary": "The XRP price action is drawing significant attention, as analysts highlight a distinct wave structure suggesting increased volatility ahead. According to technical patterns on the XRP chart, the cryptocurrency could soon face wild fluctuations on its potential path to retesting its all-time high and aiming for the $4 mark. XRP Wave Map Lays Out Path To A New ATH The XRP price is currently trading at $2.13 after enduring a months-long downtrend that has prevented any upward movement toward revisiting all-time highs. However, despite these momentum struggles, a certified crypto and Elliott Wave analyst, XForceGlobal, has boldly predicted on X (formerly Twitter) that XRP is on a clear path toward a $4 all-time high. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target The analyst shared a detailed Elliott Wave chart of XRP, suggesting that while the digital asset is poised for a new ATH, it is also set to face significant volatility on its way to this price high. The chart illustrates a well-defined pattern of corrective and impulsive wave structures that signal both short-term turbulence and long-term bullish potential for XRP. XForceGlobal\u2019s chart analysis begins by identifying a major correction that unfolded from XRP\u2019s high in January through a low in April. This move is labeled with a complex wave formation, especially a double zigzag (W-X-Y), showing strong symmetry across multiple degrees of wave structures. Interestingly, the analyst notes that the precision of these wave structures aligns almost perfectly with classic Fibonacci extension levels on the way down, including the 61.8% and 100% retracements. This indicates that the corrective cycle followed a technically sound and predictable path, leading to the conclusion that the worst of the downtrend may be over, and XRP could be entering a new wave sequence with bullish implications. The chart analysis also highlights a critical accumulation zone marked between $1.84 and $2.25. This range coincides with Fibonacci Retracement thresholds and represents a crucial decision point in XRP\u2019s price structure. Recently, XRP dipped into this zone and appears to be bouncing off it, potentially setting the stage for the next impulsive wave higher. Based on this setup, XForceGlobal forecasts an initial rally toward the $3.20 and $3.80 zone, followed by a short-term correction and then an eventual push toward a fresh ATH near $4 or higher. Analyst Predicts XRP Price In Next 3-6 Months A crypto market expert identified as \u2018Steph is Crypto\u2019 on X has declared that an XRP price explosion is imminent. The analyst shared a chart, predicting that the cryptocurrency could soon skyrocket to a jaw-dropping all-time high of $50. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Community Should Pay Attention To June 4-6, Here\u2019s Why Notably, the chart indicates that this bullish projection will only occur after XRP crosses the $2.5 resistance threshold. From there, the path could see a steady ascent through $5, $10, and even $22, ultimately aiming for the ambitious $50 milestone. What\u2019s even more striking is the timeline of this bullish forecast\u2014\u2014 Steph predicts that XRP could achieve a $50 valuation within just 3 to 6 months. If realized, this would amount to an astonishing 2,280% increase from the current price of nearly $2.1 before the end of the year. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-stabilizes-after-market-drop-key-ma-reclaim-could-trigger-a-june-rally/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has experienced a sharp pullback, retracing over 10% since yesterday as the broader crypto market faced a wave of volatility. Despite the decline, bulls are showing resilience. ETH failed to break below the critical $2,300 mark and is now holding firm above $2,400, a sign that demand remains strong at current levels. Investors are watching closely as Ethereum consolidates and attempts to recover lost ground. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure \u2013 Bearish Target At $142 Top analyst M-Log1 shared a technical update indicating that ETH is currently sitting around the 200-period moving average on the 4-hour chart. This level often acts as a major trend indicator, and reclaiming it could spark renewed bullish momentum. According to M-Log1, Ethereum\u2019s price action suggests a potential recovery toward the $2,600 zone, especially if bulls manage to push above the 50 and 100 MAs. This renewed interest in ETH comes at a pivotal moment for altcoins. Many market participants are now evaluating whether this consolidation phase marks the beginning of a larger move for Ethereum and related assets. For now, all eyes remain on key technical levels as the market awaits confirmation of direction. Ethereum Eyes Recovery After Market Shake-Up Ethereum is showing signs of strength amid heightened market volatility sparked by rising tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. The sharp war of words between the two high-profile figures triggered a wave of uncertainty in financial markets, prompting swift reactions across the cryptocurrency sector. While Bitcoin remains stable above the $100K level, altcoins have experienced significant pullbacks\u2014ETH included. However, the coming weeks are shaping up to be decisive, with many investors closely watching for signs of recovery. ETH has retraced over 10% in recent sessions but is now bouncing from the lows. Bulls appear confident as Ethereum holds above the $2,400 level and attempts to reclaim key moving averages on the 4-hour chart. According to M-Log1, ETH currently sits near the 200MA, a crucial technical level that often signals trend reversals. He notes that Ethereum is bouncing exactly as expected following last week\u2019s broader altcoin correction. M-Log1\u2019s analysis points to the $2,600 level as the next target. A successful push toward that zone, along with reclaiming the 50 and 100 moving averages, could set the stage for a strong rally throughout June. If ETH manages to build momentum and maintain support, the altcoin market could experience renewed bullish energy. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and political risk, Ethereum\u2019s resilience is notable. With technical support holding and confidence slowly returning, the setup remains constructive, assuming bulls continue to defend key levels. As the market digests recent events, ETH&#8217;s price action over the next few days will offer critical insight into whether a new altseason can take off or whether further downside is still in play. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup \u2013 Historic Run Incoming? ETH Weekly Chart: Key Levels Hold Ethereum is currently trading around $2,475 on the weekly chart, showing signs of hesitation as it faces strong resistance near the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) at $2,450. Although ETH managed to surge above this level briefly, the candle is showing rejection near the $2,680 area, which coincides with both historical resistance and the upper end of the 34-week EMA ($2,499). This confluence of resistance levels is proving to be a critical zone for bulls to reclaim. Despite the recent bounce from April lows, ETH is still struggling to gain bullish momentum on the higher timeframes. The last few candles reflect indecision, with long wicks and narrowing body size, suggesting that while buyers are defending downside levels, sellers remain active near resistance. If ETH fails to close the week above the 200-week SMA, a pullback toward the $2,300\u2013$2,250 range is likely, which aligns with the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC \u2013 Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout On the upside, a strong weekly close above $2,700 would be a major breakout signal, potentially triggering a broader altseason. For now, Ethereum\u2019s weekly structure remains neutral-to-bullish, with consolidation above the 200-week SMA acting as a key battleground for trend confirmation.

      "title": "Litecoin Wobbles Under Pressure: Can It Find Footing Below $87?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-wobbles-under-pressure/",
      "summary": "Grayhoood, a crypto trader, said on X that Litecoin is currently experiencing a bearish trend, emphasizing the ongoing weakness in price action. Over the past 24 hours, LTC has decreased by 2.8%, and the candlestick charts reflect a noticeable downward movement. As shown in the chart he referenced, LTC started the day around $89.00 but faced a sharp decline, dropping to $87.00 before managing a brief recovery to $88.50. However, the price has since fallen again to $84, indicating sustained selling pressure in the short term. Momentum Fades: RSI Drifts Toward Oversold Territory According to Grayhoood, current technical indicators suggest that Litecoin may face further downside, with multiple metrics aligning to support a bearish short-term outlook. One of the primary indicators in focus is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which appears to be drifting toward oversold territory. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D\u2019s Next Move While such a move could hint at a potential bounce, Grayhoood cautions that it also signals bearish sentiment in the market. Beyond the RSI, momentum oscillators such as the Stochastic indicator and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) are also painting a gloomy picture. These tools are typically used to gauge market reversals and the strength of ongoing trends. In this case, both are tilting toward further downward momentum if no strong bullish catalyst appears, especially as prices struggle to hold above the $87 support level. Short-Term Declines Contrast with Yearly Gains in LTC\u2019s Moving Averages The analyst further highlighted a mixed outlook from Litecoin\u2019s moving averages, suggesting a market caught between short-term weakness and long-term potential. In the near term, shorter-duration averages are flashing strong sell signals. These are driven by LTC\u2019s recent negative performance, with a -9.0% drop over the past week and a -12.5% decline over the last two weeks, painting a clear picture of growing bearish momentum and sustained selling pressure. Related Reading: Market Expert Projects \u2018Undervalued\u2019 Litecoin To Soar At Least 1,000% \u2014 Here\u2019s How However, the longer-term moving averages tell a different story. Despite recent setbacks, Litecoin has posted a 2.3% gain over the past year, which keeps the long-term trend technically bullish. This divergence suggests that while short-term traders may be responding to immediate price volatility and weakness, long-term investors could still see value in the asset, especially if broader market conditions stabilize or improve. That said, the broader market sentiment currently leans bearish, weighed down by Litecoin\u2019s inability to maintain key support levels amid recent price volatility. Even with long-term growth providing a degree of optimism, the prevailing trend is defined by downward pressure and uncertainty. Until short-term indicators begin to align with the long-term bullish structure, Litecoin may continue to face a challenging environment. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/bloodbath-incoming-dogecoin-must-hold-this-level/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s daily time-frame has reached a critical point that leaves virtually no margin for error. Price settled last night at $0.17551, clinging to a slender cushion just above the confluence of two of the chart\u2019s most important guide rails: the former down-trend resistance that runs from late February and the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2024\u2019s late advance to $0.48440. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone The structural landscape is defined by a six-month descending channel that has corralled every impulse since Dogecoin topped at $0.48440 on 8 December. The median of that channel\u2014slicing through the field at roughly $0.1800\u2014functioned as durable support until Thursday, when an 11% slide in sympathy with Bitcoin split it cleanly. A failure-retest of a channel mid-line is seldom trivial; until DOGE can reclaim $0.1800 on a closing basis, the chart message remains one of trend continuity. Beneath the market, the black trendline that first rejected rallies on 26 March, 26 April and 2 May reclaimed centre-stage after price vaulted it on 8 May, ran to the channel ceiling at $0.2540, and was twice rebuffed\u2014the first rejection on 11 May, the second on 23 May. The trendline is now retested as support where it intersects the 0.786 Fib at $0.16700, producing a high-stakes cross-point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst If that level fractures, the only historical scaffolding is the multi-year ascending trendline (drawn from May 2021\u2019s all-time high) that merges with a proven demand band spanning $0.14500 to $0.13500. That rectangle arrested the early-April shake-out and would represent the bulls\u2019 final trench; surrendering it would invalidate the long-term series of higher lows and almost certainly inaugurate a broader bear phase with potential gravitational pull back to the January pivot at $0.12990. Oscillators and overlays do little to contradict the bearish drift. The fourteen-day Relative Strength Index sits at 34.70, hovering just above oversold territory but still tracking below its own moving average at 45.22, underscoring persistent negative momentum. Price Targets Overhead, resistance layers are stacked like dominoes. Immediate priority for the bulls is a daily close back above the channel midline at $0.1800; failing that, any attempt at recovery is suspect. Related Reading: Dogecoin\u2019s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The next ceiling is the compressing exponential moving average cluster: the 20-day EMA at $0.20120, the 50-day at $0.20091, the 100-day at $0.20677 and the 200-day at $0.21550. With all four averages declining and bunched inside a three-cent band, they act as a single reinforced lid near the psychological $0.20 handle. Clearing that barricade would deliver price to the channel\u2019s upper rail, now descending through $0.22. A weekly close outside that boundary would finally neutralise the half-year downtrend and force shorts to cover into the next Fibonacci checkpoints derived from the November high: the 61.8 percent retracement at $0.23484, the 50 percent at $0.28249, the 38.2 percent at $0.33014 and the 23.6 percent at $0.38910. Until then, however, the blunt arithmetic favours the bears. A floor at $0.16700 backed by a multi-touch trendline is slim protection when sentiment is fragile and macro flows are unhelpful. If that shelf cracks, the market\u2019s inertia points toward $0.14500\u2013$0.13500, Dogecoin\u2019s last defensible plateau. Should that red demand zone capitulate, the technical map turns blank down to the January base at $0.12990 and, beyond that into deep bearish territory, especially the August 2024 low at $0.08.

As reported, crypto analyst Crypto GEM recently predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,000 by next year.

Ongoing V-Shape Recovery For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted an ongoing V-shape recovery for Ethereum.
