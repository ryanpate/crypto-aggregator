      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-under-0-20-is-free-predicts-2000-upside/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin is revisiting a technical juncture it has not seen since the months preceding its 2020\u201321 parabolic rally, according to a comparative chart published by the pseudonymous analyst Kaleo to his 705,000 followers on X. In the annotated TradingView graphic, weekly candles for DOGE-USD trace two multi-year falling wedge structures\u2014one stretching from the January 2018 high to early 2021, and an almost mirror-image pattern extending from the May 2021 peak until today. History Repeating For Dogecoin? The first wedge resolved in late 2020 with a decisive breakout above a descending trend-line that had capped every rally for more than thirty-six months. Kaleo marks that moment with a yellow label reading \u201cWe are here\u201d at roughly $0.003, immediately before the price detonated to the cycle top near $0.75 in May 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit The current structure shows the same downward-sloping resistance\u2014now anchored by successive lower highs from $0.16 in late 2022 to $0.11 in late 2023\u2014finally giving way. Since the, DOGE has recorded higher highs in April at $0.22 and in December 2024 at $0.48. Friday\u2019s close printed at $0.1604, still below the psychological $0.20 threshold but fractionally above the dotted secondary resistance that has defined the wedge\u2019s upper boundary since mid-2022. Kaleo\u2019s overlay projects the 2020 breakout trajectory forward in time, mapping a near-vertical thrust from the present $0.16 area to roughly $0.55, a brief consolidation, and a continuation leg that tops close to $3.50. While this upper target hasn\u2019t ever been printed in DOGE\u2019s history, the analyst\u2019s replica path underscores how little overhead structure exists once price escapes the wedge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal\u2014But One Move Could Ruin It A key role in the chart are playing the two vertical dashed lines labeled \u201cBTC Halving\u201d: 12 May 2020 and 21 April 2024. In Kaleo\u2019s read, Dogecoin\u2019s macro reversals are synchronized with Bitcoin\u2019s quadrennial supply shock, implying that the breakout could be a post-halving echo of the 2020 move. Price construction within the wedge also mirrors the earlier cycle: successive lower highs and higher lows compress volatility until an impulsive weekly bar pierces resistance. The horizontal line intersecting the new breakout\u2014will be the first major test of post-wedge momentum. Below, the lower dashed boundary intersects in the region between $0.10 and $0.09; a weekly close beneath that floor would invalidate the fractal. Kaleo distills the setup into a single line: \u201cDogecoin under 20 cents is free.\u201d On the chart\u2019s scale, the red quote-box at $0.1604 sits a hair\u2019s breadth under the $0.20 psychological band, reinforcing the idea that the risk-to-reward profile remains asymmetric so long as price stays below that number. Whether history rhymes as precisely as the analyst\u2019s fractal suggests will hinge on broader market liquidity and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, but from a purely structural perspective the meme-coin has already checked the same boxes it did four years ago. And the US Federal Reserve money printer hasn\u2019t even started roaring again. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.161. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "According to CNBC, corporate treasuries around the globe have surpassed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions for three consecutive quarters. This indicates a growing interest among public companies to adopt strategies similar to those pioneered by Strategy, especially in a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Bitcoin Holdings Surge Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that public companies acquired approximately 131,000 Bitcoin in the second quarter of the year, marking an 18% increase in their BTC holdings. In contrast, exchange-traded funds managed to secure about 111,000 Bitcoin, representing an 8% growth during the same period. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup \u2013 Here\u2019s Why BTC Holds The Key Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, emphasized that the motivations behind these purchases differ significantly. While institutional buyers utilizing ETFs seek exposure to BTC for a variety of reasons, Marie asserted that public companies are primarily focused on accumulating Bitcoin to enhance shareholder value. The market dynamics have also shown that public company BTC holdings increased by 4% in April, a month marked by significant volatility following President Trump\u2019s announcement of initial tariffs. During the same time frame, ETF holdings rose by only 2%. Marie noted that public companies are less concerned with Bitcoin&#8217;s current market price, prioritizing the growth of their Bitcoin reserves to appear more attractive to potential investors. ETFs Still Dominate In This Key Metric Despite the increasing activity from public companies, Bitcoin ETFs remain the largest holders of the cryptocurrency, collectively holding over 1.4 million BTC, or about 6.8% of the total capped supply of 21 million coins. Public companies, on the other hand, hold around 855,000 Bitcoin, approximately 4% of the total supply. The recent surge in corporate BTC accumulation is also a reflection of significant regulatory changes favoring the crypto industry. The last time ETFs outperformed public companies in Bitcoin purchases was during the third quarter of 2024, prior to Trump&#8217;s re-election. Several notable companies have entered the Bitcoin market recently. GameStop began acquiring Bitcoin after its board approved it as a treasury reserve asset earlier this year. Similarly, health-care firm KindlyMD merged with Nakamoto, a Bitcoin investment company, while investor Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s ProCap launched its own BTC purchasing initiative and plans to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Direct Exposure May Ease Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, continues to lead the charge in the Bitcoin treasury space with approximately 597,000 Bitcoin in its possession. Following closely is Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings, which holds nearly 50,000 coins. Ben Werkman, chief investment officer at Swan BTC, remarked on the challenges smaller firms face in trying to match Strategy&#8217;s scale. He predicted that institutional capital will continue to gravitate toward Strategy due to its deep liquidity and established presence. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury Looking ahead, Marie suggested that the number of companies adhering to a BTC treasury strategy may dwindle over the next decade as the market matures. He noted that as more firms enter the space, the individual impact of each company will likely diminish. Additionally, as Bitcoin becomes more normalized, investor constraints regarding direct exposure may fade. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, long\u2011term Bitcoin holders are sitting on unrealized gains last seen during the October 2024 market dip. Right now, those holders show an average profit of 220% on coins they bought and held for the long run. That figure is surprisingly low given Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge back above $107,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming Lower Profit Levels Than Previous Peaks Darkfost used the MVRV ratio \u2014 market value relative to the average cost paid by long\u2011term holders \u2014 to track these shifts. In March 2024, when Bitcoin pushed up to $74,500, MVRV hit 300%. Then in December 2024, at the $108,000 peak, it climbed to 350%. By contrast, today\u2019s 220% gain reflects the fact that many long\u2011term holders bought in at much higher levels than earlier in the cycle. Price Needs To Rise To Match Past Gains Based on an average cost basis of $33,800, Bitcoin would need to climb back to $135,200 just to restore that 300% profit level. If the market aimed to hit the 357% mark again, prices would have to reach roughly $154,400. Both figures track with what history tells us about investor behavior \u2014 people tend to sell when profits hit big round numbers. \ud83d\udcc9 Unrealized profits of LTH continue to decline and are now approaching levels last seen during the October 2024 correction.

That may seem high for BTC, but when compared to previous\u2026 pic.twitter.com/NeTCmXZVTY \u2014 Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) July 1, 2025 &#160; Historical Cycle Comparisons Looking farther back shows how much room remains. In December 2017, at the $19,500 top, long\u2011term holders saw unrealized profits of 4,000%. Then during the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin spiked to $63,000 in April 2021 and MVRV topped out at 1,230%. By November 2021, prices hit about $68,400 but unrealized gains for long\u2011term holders had already fallen to 340%. An analyst&#8217;s recent outlook lines up with this math, first pegging a cycle top at $135,000 in October 2024. After reviewing new data in May 2025, they revised the target range to $120,000\u2013$150,000 and suggested a likely peak between August and September 2025. That range overlaps with the price levels needed to bring MVRV back to earlier highs. Room For More Upside, But Watch The Risks Based on latest figures, Bitcoin is trading at $106,750, roughly flat over the last 24 hours. Lower profit margins mean fewer long\u2011term holders are itching to sell right now, which could leave more fuel for higher prices. Still, on\u2011chain numbers don\u2019t capture the whole picture. Spot-market flows, ETF moves and wider economic shifts can all trigger sharp reversals. Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful?

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/michael-saylors-strategy-set-to-yield-14-billion-profit-in-q2-bloomberg/",
      "summary": "Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is on track to report an impressive $14 billion in unrealized gains from its extensive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Co-founded by Michael Saylor, the company has successfully transformed itself from a struggling enterprise software provider into a leading leveraged Bitcoin proxy, drawing comparisons to major corporate powerhouses such as Amazon and JPMorgan Chase. Strategy Set To Post Record Profits According to a recent Bloomberg report, Strategy&#8217;s anticipated profits stem largely from the rebound in Bitcoin prices and recent changes in accounting practices that allow the firm to value its substantial cryptocurrency holdings at market rates. Analysts project that while Strategy&#8217;s software business may only generate approximately $112.8 million in revenue for the second quarter, the surge in Bitcoin prices has significantly bolstered its financial outlook. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury This potential record profit comes after a turbulent period for the company, which faced criticism from notable investors like Jim Chanos. Chanos has publicly derided Saylor&#8217;s valuation model, describing it as &#8220;financial gibberish,&#8221; while Saylor has countered that Chanos fails to grasp the intricacies of his approach. Despite the skepticism, Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Capital, noted Saylor&#8217;s resilience, stating that he has consistently outperformed not only his critics but also the broader market. Since Saylor initiated his Bitcoin buying spree, Strategy\u2019s stock has skyrocketed over 3,300%. In the same time frame, Bitcoin has appreciated approximately 1,000%, while the S&#38;P 500 has advanced around 115%. The company&#8217;s shares saw a 40% increase in the second quarter, significantly outpacing the S&#38;P&#8217;s 11% rise. $64 Billion Bitcoin Value The recent accounting change at Strategy, which took effect in the first quarter, allows the firm to recognize the market value of its Bitcoin holdings\u2014currently valued at about $64 billion\u2014resulting in substantial swings in reported earnings. Previously, the company treated its Bitcoin similar to intangible assets, which limited their ability to recognize gains unless the assets were sold. This change has positioned Strategy to capture the full benefit of Bitcoin&#8217;s price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase At the start of the second quarter, Strategy held 528,185 BTC, valued at over $43.5 billion based on market prices. An increase in the value of Bitcoin of 30% during the quarter alone contributed more than $13 billion to the company&#8217;s unrealized gains. Cumulatively, weekly purchases have brought the company closer to holding 600,000 BTC. Despite the positive outlook, the company has faced legal challenges, including several class-action lawsuits claiming that executives misled shareholders regarding the first-quarter losses. In response, Strategy has pledged to vigorously defend against these accusations. As of press time, BTC trades at $106,100, down 5% from its current record high of $111,800 during May\u2019s rally.

      "title": "Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-seasonality-summer-2025/",
      "summary": "A growing number of Bitcoin and crypto market participants have fallen victim to a dangerous assumption: that summer in the crypto markets is synonymous with stagnation. However, crypto analyst Cristian Chifoi warns that this summer may follow a drastically different script. In a video analysis released on July 1, Chifoi lays out a compelling case that 2025 fits a historical pattern that has previously delivered some of Bitcoin\u2019s strongest summer performances. Summer 2025 Could Flip Bitcoin\u2019s Script Chifoi\u2019s thesis is based on a concept he has long explored: Bitcoin seasonality\u2014a recurring, cyclical behavior in Bitcoin\u2019s price action across the calendar year, especially in relation to the four-year halving cycles. According to Chifoi, there is an identifiable seasonal window from mid-January to mid-March where Bitcoin historically shows explosive movement in one direction, only to reverse course in the subsequent months. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm\u2014Bitcoin Could Explode Soon This pattern has held across multiple years and cycles. In 2021, for example, Bitcoin rallied from $28,000 to $60,000 between January and March before collapsing back to $28,000 by summer. The opposite occurred in 2023, when Bitcoin dumped in Q1 and reversed upwards during summer. \u201cFrom January 22nd to March 11th [2024], we had a 2x on Bitcoin,\u201d Chifoi noted. \u201cAnd if the price moves in one direction in this window, it tends to do the exact opposite after that. That\u2019s the seasonality reversal.\u201d Chifoi highlighted this tendency across previous cycles as well, identifying the same trend flip in 2022, 2023, and most notably in 2021. Critically, Chifoi warns that while most traders are anchored to the recent past\u2014recalling three consecutive \u201cboring\u201d summers\u2014this year is historically aligned with a different kind of setup. \u201cNobody is prepared for this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause people only look at the past three years. But those were not the years to look at.\u201d Instead, Chifoi compares 2025 to three historical analogues: 2013, 2017, and 2021\u2014all years that followed a halving and saw significant summer rallies. In each of those years, after early-year volatility or corrections, Bitcoin posted dramatic gains from mid-July into early September. In 2017, Bitcoin rallied 160% in that timeframe. In 2021, the move was 77%. \u201cThe common factor in those years? They were one year after a halving, with a post-March reversal in trend,\u201d Chifoi explained. \u201cNow we are in the same window again. And people are not looking at it.\u201d First Crash, Then Surge? The analyst also emphasized that current price action fits his broader fractal thesis. After Bitcoin\u2019s local top at $109K earlier this year and the rejection that followed, the market appears to be chopping sideways\u2014something he predicted back in late 2024. He expects this phase to continue into July 20, potentially ending with a sudden flush to the downside. But this, he argues, would be the setup for the next leg higher. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if the drop comes with a lot of bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a dump before a rally, the media has a narrative ready. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s real. It just means the market is doing what it always does\u2014shake out the majority.\u201d Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 \u2014 Details Chifoi also addressed broader market confluences, notably pointing out similar behavior in the S&#38;P 500, where a corrective move in early July appears to align with his crypto timing model. He expects a pullback in both markets to precede the next upward thrust, targeting a Fibonacci resistance zone that historically acts as a pause point during price discovery. Despite his bullishness, Chifoi made it clear he\u2019s not buying Bitcoin right now. \u201cI already bought below $20K,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m watching altcoin charts, looking for pullbacks to accumulate.\u201d He expressed frustration at the prevailing narratives circulating among large X accounts, particularly those pushing for rotating altcoins into Bitcoin under the assumption that dominance will rise indefinitely. \u201cThis is very stupid,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cThe market is behaving exactly as it should\u2014for the fewest number of people to make money.\u201d In closing, Chifoi cautioned that those who insist on saying this time is different will likely find themselves on the wrong side of the trade. \u201cOnly if this time is different will this not play out. But if you base your strategy on those words, I can guarantee you 99% of the time, you won\u2019t make money.\u201d As the July 20 pivot approaches, Chifoi\u2019s analysis suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s next move may catch a complacent market off guard. Whether or not history rhymes once more, the veteran analyst has made his stance clear: this is not a summer to sleep through. At press time, BTC traded at $106,880.
