      "summary": "A sweeping new research report by Ben Harvey and Will Clemente III, commissioned by market maker Keyrock, projects that Bitcoin could reach $160,000 by the end of 2025\u2014but only if the capital structure supporting Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTC-TCs) remains intact. The research, \u201cBTC Treasuries Uncovered: Premiums, Leverage, and the Sustainability of Proxy Exposure,\u201d dissects the capital structures, market impact, and debt profiles of the fast-growing cohort of \u201cBitcoin Treasury Companies\u201d (BTC-TCs), led by Strategy (the renamed MicroStrategy). The Impact Of Bitcoin Treasury Firms Harvey and Clemente open with a startling figure: \u201cBitcoin Treasury Companies have accumulated around 725,000 BTC, equivalent to 3.64 percent of the entire BTC supply.\u201d Much of that hoard sits with Strategy\u2019s 597,000-coin trove, but the analysts track more than a dozen follow-on players\u2014from Marathon Digital and Metaplanet to newer entrants such as Twenty One Capital\u2014whose combined exposure now outstrips US spot-ETF holdings by more than half. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Yet the report\u2019s headline forecast is explicitly conditional. Keyrock\u2019s bull case assigns a thirty-percent probability that global liquidity remains flush, institutional demand accelerates, and Bitcoin rallies fifty percent past today\u2019s levels, \u201cpushing BTC to over $160 k by EOY.\u201d That outcome rests on the fragile flywheel of net-asset-value premiums: BTC-TC equities still trade, on average, at a seventy-three-percent premium to the dollar value of the coins they custody. Those premiums let boards issue new shares \u201caccretively,\u201d convert sentiment into fresh BTC, and\u2014crucially\u2014service the $33.7 billion in debt and preferred stock the sector has rung up to fund its buying binge. No company illustrates the reflexive loop better than Strategy. Since August 2020, Michael Saylor has driven Bitcoin-per-share (BPS) up eleven-fold, an annualized sixty-three-percent run rate that dwarfs the 6.7 percent CAGR needed to justify the firm\u2019s current ninety-one-percent NAV premium. \u201cIf an investor believes that Strategy\u2019s BPS growth rates will hold long-term,\u201d the authors contend, \u201cholding MSTR would be far more beneficial in BTC terms than holding spot BTC.\u201d Still, that calculus assumes the equity premium stays afloat; if sentiment turns, dilution flips from accretive to punitive overnight. Debt maturities pose the next stress point. BTC-TCs owe a wall of convertible notes in 2027-28. Harvey and Clemente calculate that Strategy alone has issued $8.2 billion of the cohort\u2019s $9.5 billion in debt; Marathon follows at $1.3 billion. Most instruments carry zero-to-low coupons and conversion prices well below current share levels, but a deep Bitcoin drawdown could drive equities under those strikes, forcing firms to repay in cash or refinance at far harsher terms. \u201cSince many BTC-TC valuations are tightly correlated to Bitcoin price performance,\u201d the authors warn, \u201ca sharp BTC drawdown could drive down equity value, increasing the risk that conversion thresholds are breached.\u201d Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000\u2014Is History Repeating? The report splits the universe into cash-flow-generative names such as Metaplanet, CoinShares, and Boyaa Interactive\u2014each with eight or more quarters of runway\u2014and capital-dependent players like Marathon, Nakamoto, and DeFi Technologies, which could face dilution above three percent per quarter merely to stay solvent if premiums persist. Should those premiums compress, equity issuance \u201cbecomes purely dilutive,\u201d and treasury companies could be forced to sell Bitcoin, undermining the proxy thesis that justifies their existence. The Base Case Keyrock\u2019s base case, to which it assigns the highest probability, envisions Bitcoin finishing 2025 around $135,000, with NAV premiums cooling into a thirty-to-sixty-percent range. In that environment, well-managed treasuries still out-perform spot, but the leverage trade loses its shine. The bear scenario\u2014assigned the lowest but non-trivial odds\u2014combines a twenty-percent Bitcoin drawdown with a glut of new treasury listings that flood the market with supply. In that world, premiums vanish, refinancing windows slam shut, and \u201cthe entire investment case for BTC-TCs comes under pressure.\u201d Harvey and Clemente do not dismiss the BTC-TC model; rather, they frame it as a high-beta overlay that amplifies both the upside and the solvency risk inherent in Bitcoin itself. They credit Saylor\u2019s \u201cBitcoin yield\u201d thesis\u2014using premium-funded share issuance to compound coin holdings\u2014as a demonstrably effective strategy to date, but caution that it relies on a delicate equilibrium of bullish sentiment, cheap capital, and meticulous execution. \u201cThe premium to NAV is of the utmost importance here,\u201d the study concludes, \u201cassuming a BTC-TC doesn\u2019t have a core operating business that can cover debt payments, or is entirely free of debt payments altogether.\u201d Whether Bitcoin can sprint to $160,000 by 31 December hinges less on hash-rate projections or macro modeling than on the continued faith of equity investors willing to pay a dollar-fifty for a dollar of embedded BTC. If those investors blink\u2014if premiums fade or convertible maturities collide with a broad risk-off shift\u2014the leverage that has propelled treasury companies to date could flip, turning \u201cone of the best performing equities on the planet\u201d into the market\u2019s most crowded exit. For now, Keyrock\u2019s research leaves readers with a simple countdown: hold the line, and the path to price discovery remains intact; lose it, and the proxy trade could unwind long before the New Year\u2019s fireworks.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-open-interest-climbs/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin open interest has risen rapidly once again, with the price pushing above previous peaks to new all-time highs. The BTC price has also stayed over the $100,000 mark for an extended period of time, triggering a new wave of confidence that the cryptocurrency has found its bottom. This has led to crypto traders making their bets and driving the open interest up, pushing it back above December 2024 levels and May 2025 peaks. Bitcoin Open Interest Crosses $70 Billion Again Back in December 2024, the Bitcoin open interest had recorded a new milestone after the volume rose to over $70 billion, marking a new all-time high at the time. The Bitcoin price had also risen sharply at this time and was able to hit $100,000 for the first time in history, triggering even more interest in the asset. Related Reading: Last Crash Before The Surge: Why Bitcoin Is Set To Drop Below $107,000 However, once both the price and the open interest hit these milestones, it wasn\u2019t long before the shorters began to take over the market. The Bitcoin price quickly plummeted back down below $100,000, and over the next few months, open interest would crash back down to the $40 billion territory, resulting in a 40% loss by May 2025. Now, once again, the Bitcoin open interest has crossed the $70 billion mark, sitting close to the $77 billion peak recorded back in May 2025, data from Coinglass shows. In the same vein, the BTC price has been able to maintain above $100,000 and has hit a new all-time high of $117,000. Going by historical performance, it is likely that the Bitcoin price will continue to rise from here, but this break to new all-time highs could carry bearish implications. This is because it is possible that the trend from December 2024 could play out once again. If this happens, then the Bitcoin price could retrace after hitting new highs, an expected correction as shorts pile up. BTC Price Risks Another Crash As the Bitcoin open interest continues to rise and the price has already broken out to new highs, the expectations of a downtrend have become stronger. reported that crypto analyst FriendlyRox expects the Bitcoin price to crash by almost 50%, putting the target as low as $60,000 by the time it\u2019s done.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-breaks-symmetrical-triangle-next-stop-164/",
      "summary": "Solana has shown a potential breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle. Here&#8217;s where the next price target could lie, according to an analyst. Solana Has Surged Above Symmetrical Triangle Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Solana has just broken a resistance line. The level in question is part of a Symmetrical Triangle, a pattern from technical analysis (TA). This pattern belongs to the class of triangles, formations that involve the asset trading within two converging trendlines. The upper line acts as a source of resistance, while the lower one as that of support. A break out of either of these levels implies a continuation of trend in that direction. A surge above the triangle is a bullish sign and a drop under it a bearish one. Since the price&#8217;s range becomes narrower as it travels within a triangle, a breakout can become more likely as it approaches the apex. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype\u2014$4.4B Inflows Back The Move Generally, triangle breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the height of the formation (that is, the distance between the upper and lower trendlines at their widest). There are three popular triangle types: Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical. The first and second variants have one trendline parallel to the time-axis. In the case of the Ascending type, it&#8217;s the upper level. This means that as Solana moves inside an Ascending Triangle, its range gets narrower toward a net upside. Similarly, the Descending Triangle involves the opposite setup, with the support line being parallel to the time-axis instead. The third type, the Symmetrical Triangle, is the middle ground between the two: it has the two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In other words, the Symmetrical Triangle represents a period of consolidation where the range gets narrower in true sideways fashion. Due to this fact, a breakout is more-or-less equally probable to occur in either direction. In contrast, there is a bias associated in Ascending and Descending Triangles. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle Solana was trading inside just earlier: As is visible in the above graph, the Solana price was nearing in on the end of the triangle and as probability would dictate, a breakout was becoming likely. The asset indeed ended up finding a break and it seems to have been in the up direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading So what could be next for SOL? According to the analyst, the asset might target $164. This level corresponds to the 1.272 Fibonacci Extension line. Fibonacci Extension levels are defined based on ratios found in the popular Fibonacci series. The 1.272 level, in particular, corresponds to the square root of 1.618, which is the famous &#8216;Golden Ratio.&#8217; SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $158, up 3% in the last 24 hours.

DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1750 and $0.180 levels. The price is trading above the $0.1880 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1910 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Dogecoin Price Eyes More Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase from the $0.1750 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE was able to climb above the $0.180 and $0.1880 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.1920 resistance. Finally, the price traded close to the $0.20 barrier. A high was formed at $0.1992 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1660 swing low to the $0.1992 high.

Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1910 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1980 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.20 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2050 level. A close above the $0.2050 resistance might send the price toward the $0.220 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2320 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.250. Downside Correction In DOGE? If DOGE\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.20 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1910 level or the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $0.1820 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1660 swing low to the $0.1992 high. The main support sits at $0.1780. If there is a downside break below the $0.1780 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1750 level or even $0.1720 in the near term.
