      "summary": "Bitcoin is facing resistance just below its $112,000 all-time high, struggling to break into price discovery as the market gains momentum. After reaching a high of $110,500 yesterday, BTC has retraced over 2%, but price action remains bullish. Traders are closely watching this consolidation, which may act as a springboard for a decisive move upward. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern \u2013 $2,200 Support Back In Focus? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, multiple technical indicators support a bullish outlook. Notably, Bitcoin has just confirmed a bullish MACD crossover on the daily timeframe, which is often a precursor to upside continuation. Adding to the bullish case is Bitcoin\u2019s highest monthly close in history, a key psychological milestone that could bring new inflows and spark renewed interest from sidelined investors. The current setup points to a market that\u2019s primed for upside, provided buyers can reclaim the $112K level. As macroeconomic uncertainty fades and bullish momentum builds across the crypto space, Bitcoin could soon enter uncharted territory. All eyes are on the next few sessions as BTC tests critical levels with strong technical backing. Bitcoin Nears Crucial Breakout Phase Amid Bullish Momentum Bitcoin has gained over 10% since June 22, climbing from local lows near $98,000 to current levels around $108,000. This steady advance reflects renewed optimism across the crypto market, but the asset now enters a critical phase. Price action has stalled just below the $112,000 all-time high\u2014a resistance level that has capped Bitcoin\u2019s upside since late May. The coming days will be decisive, as a breakout above this level could trigger price discovery, while a rejection may open the door for a broader pullback. Despite the short-term uncertainty, the long-term outlook remains firmly bullish. Many analysts argue that an eventual move beyond $112K is inevitable, driven by favorable macro trends, strong institutional interest, and growing demand for spot ETFs. Still, caution is warranted. A failure to hold current support levels\u2014especially the $105,000\u2013$106,000 zone\u2014could lead to a drop below $100,000 and shake out overleveraged positions. Ted Pillows remains confident, stating, \u201cYou can\u2019t be bearish on Bitcoin now.\u201d His view is based on a confluence of technical factors: a confirmed bullish MACD crossover, a clean support retest, and Bitcoin\u2019s highest monthly close on record. These signals, combined with steady momentum, suggest that a new all-time high could be just days away. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support \u2013 Bulls Eye $20 Range BTC Faces Rejection At $109K, Eyes Key Support At $106K Bitcoin\u2019s price is consolidating after failing to hold above the $109,300 resistance level, as seen on the 4-hour chart. After briefly tapping above $110,000, BTC retraced and is now hovering around $107,961. This rejection suggests that the all-time high zone remains a major obstacle for bulls despite the ongoing uptrend. Price is now testing the 50 SMA (blue line), currently acting as dynamic support, while the 100 and 200 SMAs (green and red) below provide a broader safety net in the $106,000\u2013$106,500 region. The key level to watch remains $109,300. A decisive break and close above this level on strong volume would likely signal the start of price discovery. However, if bears manage to push BTC below $106,000, we could see a retest of the $103,600 support\u2014an area that has held multiple times since late May. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility \u2013 $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum Volume is relatively low compared to previous impulse moves, indicating that the current pullback may be a healthy pause rather than a trend reversal. For now, Bitcoin\u2019s structure remains bullish, with higher highs and higher lows intact. If bulls can defend this support zone and regain momentum, a new attempt at breaking $112,000 may come sooner rather than later. The next 48\u201372 hours will be critical.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/chainlink-price-to-struggle-below-15-levels-to-watch/",
      "summary": "The Chainlink price has impressed at times this year, but it has struggled to mount a sustained bullish run over the past few months. Most recently, the altcoin demonstrated a strong resurgence by moving from around $13 to just beneath $16 in the first half of June. However, the Chainlink price soon suffered a severe downturn, reaching as low as $11.2 by June 22. While the price of the LINK token has recovered above the $13 level, below are two of the critical levels investors should watch out for over the coming weeks. If Resistance Is At $15, Where Is LINK\u2019s Next Support? In a recent post on the social media platform X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting on-chain insight into the current setup of the Chainlink price. According to the market pundit, the altcoin could be approaching a critical resistance level around the $15 region. Related Reading: Whales Are Loading Up on Chainlink (LINK), But Retail Investors Are Still Missing the Signal This on-chain revelation is based on the average cost basis of several LINK investors. For context, cost-basis analysis examines a level\u2019s capacity to function as support or resistance based on the volume of tokens last acquired by investors in the price region. As depicted in the chart above, the size of the dot represents the amount of LINK tokens purchased within each price region and its corresponding strength. The bigger the dot, the larger the volume of purchased tokens, and the stronger the support or resistance. It is worth noting that the green dots are the support levels, as they are below the current price, while the red dots refer to resistance, as they are above the current price. According to data highlighted by Martinez, the Chainlink price faces a major supply barrier around the $14.88 \u2013 $15.32 region, where 10,440 addresses bought 89.63 million LINK tokens (equivalent $1.36 billion at an average price of $15.12). This region could prove to be a resistance to price, as investors with their cost basis around the level would likely sell as soon as they break even, thereby putting downward pressure on the LINK price. Furthermore, IntoTheBlock data shows that the Chainlink price could find significant support around the $12.87 \u2013 $13.26 bracket, where 20,260 investors acquired 53.91 million LINK tokens at an average price of $13.05. The rationale behind this is that, when LINK\u2019s price returns to around $12.8, investors with their cost basis in and around this level are likely to defend their position by purchasing more coins, ensuring the altcoin stays above the support area. Chainlink Price At A Glance As of this writing, the LINK token is valued at around $13.16, reflecting an almost 4% price decline in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "Solana is facing a critical test this week, consolidating in a tight range between $145 and $160 since Monday. The price action reflects strong buying interest but also hesitation as bulls struggle to reclaim higher levels. Despite holding above key support, Solana must break decisively above resistance to confirm a bullish breakout and continue its upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern \u2013 $2,200 Support Back In Focus? Market momentum has favored bulls in recent weeks, but Solana\u2019s inability to breach the $160 zone raises questions about the strength of this trend. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights highlighting that Solana is currently ranging within a rising channel pattern\u2014a structure that, while seemingly bullish, can often precede a breakdown to lower demand zones if support fails. This makes the coming days especially important for SOL\u2019s trajectory. As macro conditions improve and Bitcoin flirts with new all-time highs, Solana is expected to respond in kind. However, technical signals suggest caution. A break below the rising channel could target the $128.50 support area, while a successful breakout above $160 could open the door to retesting local highs. Traders and investors alike are closely watching Solana\u2019s next move in this high-stakes consolidation phase. Solana Holds Key Support Amid Rising Channel Formation Solana is currently trading below the $150 level, reflecting a notable 20% decline from its local high set in May. Despite this setback, the asset continues to hold a strong support base, signaling that bullish sentiment has not entirely faded. The broader market remains in a consolidation phase, with Solana showing signs of indecision as it moves sideways within a tightening price range. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, pointing out that a breakout above the key $150\u2013$160 supply zone could spark renewed upside momentum. However, the current price structure suggests that Solana may not be ready yet to retest previous highs. According to Carl Runefelt, Solana is ranging within a rising channel\u2014a pattern that can lead to sharp movements if broken. While rising channels can sustain bullish continuation, a breakdown below the lower trendline often results in accelerated downside moves. Runefelt warns that if Solana breaks below the channel, the next key support area lies around $128.50. This level has historically acted as a strong demand zone and could serve as the next target in the event of a bearish move. In the meantime, Solana\u2019s consolidation reflects broader market uncertainty, with traders waiting for a decisive breakout or breakdown to guide positioning. A successful reclaim of the $150 level would improve sentiment significantly and could set the stage for a push toward the $170\u2013$180 range. On the other hand, failure to hold above current levels may shift the narrative toward further downside risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support \u2013 Bulls Eye $20 Range SOL Holds Range Amid Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $147.62, moving sideways within a tightening range and forming a potential rising channel pattern. The daily chart reveals that SOL has been unable to break decisively above the $155\u2013$160 resistance zone, while strong support remains near the $140 level. Price action shows repeated rejections near the 100-day moving average (blue line), which now acts as dynamic resistance around $155.60. The 200-day moving average (red) sits further above $165.54, marking a long-term resistance area. Volume remains relatively low compared to early June spikes, suggesting market participants are waiting for a clear breakout direction. A push above $160 would likely trigger bullish momentum, potentially opening the door toward the $170 level. However, the rising channel identified by analysts suggests a possible downside risk if the lower trendline fails. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance \u2013 Bulls Target $97.10 Level If Solana breaks below the $145 support and falls out of the channel, the next target would be the $128.50 area, which previously acted as a demand zone in mid-May. Until then, bulls must defend current levels and aim to reclaim the 100-day SMA to maintain the broader recovery structure. The coming sessions may offer clarity as consolidation nears its resolution. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-wave-count-1800/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is still struggling below $3,000 despite the Bitcoin price sitting close to all-time highs. At the current levels, Ethereum continues to look incredibly bearish, with sell-offs dominating the market at this level. While piling shorts are pointing to a possible relief rally, there is also the possibility that the price will crash back down from here. Crypto analyst Weslad maps out the ETH price trajectory using the ABCDE wave structure, showing a possible crash below $2,000. The Bullish Ethereum Scenario Weslad points to the 2021 Ethereum peak when the price reached $4,851 as the point when a large-scale symmetrical pennant had formed for the digital asset. Interestingly, this has continued for multiple years already, and continues to play out even in 2025, four years later. So far, the analyst believes that the altcoin has been in a long-term accumulation phase in a defined corrective range. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says Another important development is the formation of an ABCDE wave pattern. This pattern often predicts peaks and troughs, and depending on where the asset is in the pattern, it could point to a recovery or a crash. Presently, the crypto analyst puts the Ethereum price as being somewhere in a D wave, which is still bullish for the price. \u201cCurrently, price action is developing near point D, approaching the upper boundary of the pennant, a crucial area that could define the next directional move,\u201d the analyst said. If this D wave plays out as expected, then the Ethereum price is expected to actually surge from here. The top of this pattern would put it above $3,500 before the move is completed. On the upper end of this is the formation of an Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern. This pattern has seen the $2,855 acting as key resistance, beating the Ethereum price down multiple times this year. However, if a sustained break is achieved above this level, in conjunction with a breakout from Wave D, then it is possible that the price does rally to new all-time highs above $6,000. The Bearish Scenario While the formation of the ABCDE wave count points to some bullishness for the Ethereum price, there is still the possibility that the price could go in the opposite direction. For example, after the D wave is completed, comes the next wave in the sequence, which is the E wave, and this is a bearish wave. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says As the crypto analyst explains, a temporary rejection at the neckline or pennant resistance would trigger an E wave retracement. In this case, the Ethereum price could see an over 30% crash, putting it back toward the $1,400-$1,800 level, where there is the most support. \u201cRecent price behavior shows compressed volatility and increased buying interest on dips, reinforcing the possibility of an imminent directional breakout,\u201d Weslad warned. \u201cA decisive move outside this macro structure may mark the beginning of a new phase of long-term price expansion.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"
