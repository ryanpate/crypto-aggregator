He\u2019s put about 80% of his net worth into BTC at an average price below $25,000. Rather than fret over today\u2019s high sticker, he says the odds favor more gains ahead than losses. Related Reading: Blank Pi Network Wallets Spark Outcry\u2014What\u2019s The Network Hiding? Deaton\u2019s Big Bet According to Deaton, buying at six figures isn\u2019t too late. He calls today\u2019s price range \u201cmore asymmetrical,\u201d meaning the upside is greater than the downside. He\u2019s put 80% of his wealth into Bitcoin. His average entry cost was less than $25,000. Still, he sees room to run even from around $106,000. Macro Concerns Drive Interest Based on reports, Deaton worries about soaring national debt in the US and fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office. He flags endless money printing by central banks as a red flag. I\u2019m not in favor of telling people living paycheck to paycheck (me until 15 years ago) to take out a mortgage on their primary home to buy Bitcoin (I\u2019m not suggesting that that\u2019s what David is recommending either), but I am in the process of selling real estate, and although my\u2026 https://t.co/JMB1zgeazW \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 8, 2025 He says all these moves are chipping away at trust in fiat cash. With only 21 million BTC ever to be mined, Bitcoin can\u2019t be inflated away. That fixed supply, he argues, makes it a solid hedge against a shaky dollar. Corporate And State Adoption Institutional demand is also on the rise. MicroStrategy\u2014now called Strategy\u2014holds more than 200,000 BTC, worth tens of billions of dollars. And in the last seven days, 16 companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. On the government side, Rep. Tim Burchett introduced a bill to turn a Trump executive order into law, creating a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries like Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are weighing similar steps. They want to see if holding Bitcoin could protect their foreign exchange plans. Skeptics Voice Worries Not everyone agrees with Deaton\u2019s rosy outlook. Economist Peter Schiff, a gold advocate, says Bitcoin has no real value and is too wild to be a safe haven. He tweeted that today\u2019s rally is just hype. Deaton doesn\u2019t shy away from such criticism. He admits he has \u201cconfirmation and wealth-preservation bias.\u201d He still insists Bitcoin is the best store of value during today\u2019s economic storms. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Deaton warns against buying with money you can\u2019t afford to lose. He tells people living paycheck-to-paycheck not to risk their homes or take out loans just to buy crypto. His basic message is simple: look past daily price swings and ask where the world\u2019s money is headed. If you share his concerns about the dollar and believe institutions will keep piling in, his bet on Bitcoin could pay off. But anyone on the sidelines should be ready for big swings and should only invest what they can handle. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-chart-flexes-strength/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is making waves once again, flashing strength on the weekly chart as it closes well above key moving averages. With momentum indicators still favoring the bulls and no signs of exhaustion in sight, the current setup hints that the rally might be far from over. Could this be the beginning of an even bigger breakout? Bitcoin Stays Elevated: Bulls Show No Signs of Fatigue In a recent update shared on X, Shaco AI highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s continued bullish momentum, pointing to strong weekly performance on the BTC/USDT chart. The analyst noted that BTC has \u201cballooned past recent expectations,\u201d closing the week at an impressive $105,700. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $97,000 Cost Basis Holds Key To Next Breakout This places the asset well above its 25-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $95,009.55 and the 50-week SMA at $83,318.12, an encouraging technical signal that suggests Bitcoin\u2019s uptrend remains firmly intact. As Shaco AI put it, \u201cThe party isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d hinting that bullish sentiment could carry BTC even higher. Technical indicators further support this upbeat outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads 63.51, indicating that buying momentum remains robust without entering overbought territory. This suggests that traders are still comfortable accumulating at current levels, and the market hasn&#8217;t yet reached a point of exhaustion. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains firmly in positive territory at 5835.33. The MACD&#8217;s positioning reflects steady buyer interest and a favorable trend structure, both of which are crucial for sustaining an upward move. Volume Slackens While Price Nears Critical Resistance Zone The analyst went on to point out that despite the bullish setup currently seen on Bitcoin\u2019s chart, the enthusiasm might be tempered by softening trading volume. Specifically, trading volume has only reached 95,302, significantly lower than the average volume of 179,421. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Again, Triggering Fresh Fears of a Deeper Correction This discrepancy signals a noticeable dip in market participation, raising the question of whether the ongoing price rally has enough fuel to sustain its momentum in the short term. As the analyst emphasized, this drop in volume is worth watching closely since it may influence the momentum of next week\u2019s price action. Looking at the broader picture, Bitcoin is approaching a major resistance level at $111,980. This key barrier represents a potential turning point; either it gets broken and paves the way for further upside, or it holds and prompts a short-term correction. Should a pullback occur, the analyst noted that BTC appears to have a comfortable support zone at $49,000, which could act as a solid cushion. In any case, the analyst suggests keeping a close eye on how these technical levels play out, as they could dictate Bitcoin\u2019s next big move.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-remains-bullish-above-2/",
      "summary": "The XRP price is holding strongly above $2, maintaining its momentum as technical indicators show signs of a bullish trend. Notably, a distinct Falling Channel on the XRP price chart suggests that a breakout could be brewing, with a potential rally toward $3.8 in sight. XRP Price Holds Steady As Bulls Target $3.8 A technical analysis by Rose Premium Signals reveals that XRP is currently flashing strong bullish signals following a breakout from a long-term Falling Channel. Earlier in January, XRP broke past $3 but experienced a strong correction that has kept its price down ever since. Despite the ongoing downtrend, XRP has been firmly holding above the $2 threshold as it prepares for new all-time highs. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? Previously, XRP traded within a descending range for several months, forming lower highs and lower lows. However, recent price action has seemingly invalidated this downtrend structure with a decisive breakout above the upper boundary of the Falling Channel, indicating a potential trend reversal and the beginning of a bullish continuation. The chart shared by Rose Premium Signals on X (formerly Twitter) shows that after the breakout, XRP has been consolidating above the former resistance-turned-support zone, around the $2 level. The analyst confidently states that XRP\u2019s outlook remains inherently bullish despite past downtrends, suggesting that the recent consolidation pattern indicates that bulls are still in control. Notably, the breakout above the Falling Channel is significant, as it typically implies a strong upside move, especially on higher time frames. Projected price targets based on technical formation are positioned at $2.9520, $3.3967, and $3.8767. Interestingly, the highest projected target exceeds XRP\u2019s all-time high of $3.84 and reflects a 73.54% increase from current price levels. It\u2019s important to note that these bullish targets forecasted by Rose Premium Signals align with historical resistance zones and measured moves from the Falling Channel breakout. If momentum sustains and market conditions remain favorable, XRP could rally toward these targets over the coming weeks, potentially offering significant upside for long-term holders and traders. Analyst Says Buy The Dip, With Ideal Entry At $1.85 While forecasting several optimistic targets for XRP, Rose Premium Signals emphasized a strategy of buying the altcoin during dips. This method aims to capitalize on low price points to maximize potential gains as XRP rebounds. Related Reading: Wave Count Analysis Reveals The XRP Price Trigger Point For Take-Off The analyst\u2018s chart highlights the $1.85 support level with a clear \u201cBuy Here\u201d label, suggesting that this level is considered an ideal entry point should the price revisit it. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.23, meaning a drop to $1.85 would represent a 17.04% decrease. According to the analysis, this support level also marks the base of the recent Falling Channel breakout, providing a favorable risk-reward setup for those looking to enter or expand their positions.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/coinbase-account-freezing-issue-best-wallet-alternative/",
      "summary": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has acknowledged that the unexpected freezing of user accounts has been a major issue for the cryptocurrency exchange. In a recent announcement on X, Armstrong stated that the company has successfully reduced these unnecessary account restrictions by 82% and is committed to further improvements. The progress comes after significant investment in upgrading the platform\u2019s machine learning models and infrastructure, according to Dor Levi, a product team member at Coinbase. The enhancements have improved the precision of the Coinbase security systems, leading to fewer legitimate accounts being mistakenly flagged and frozen. Despite these advancements, Armstrong and Levi confirmed that Coinbase will continue to comply with court orders and legal sanctions requiring account restrictions. The Custodial Dilemma: When Your Crypto Isn\u2019t Yours Despite the platform\u2019s efforts, the announcement has been met with continued frustration from many customers. Some users on social media reported being unable to access funds for months, and in some cases, over two years, leading many to abandon the platform. Compounding the issue are complaints made on X about the difficulty of reaching a human customer service representative to resolve matters. The situation is a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with custodial wallets, where a third party, like Coinbase, holds the user\u2019s private keys and thus has ultimate control over their funds. Given these challenges, the principle of \u2018not your keys, not your crypto\u2019 has never been more relevant. The only way to guarantee immunity from third-party freezes, breaches, or restrictions is by using a non-custodial wallet like Best Wallet, where you retain complete control of your private keys and digital assets. Best Wallet: Security You Control, Freedom You Deserve If you\u2019re looking to escape these custodial risks, Best Wallet offers a powerful solution built on the principle of true ownership.
