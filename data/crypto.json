      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-30-crash-to-1800/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst Crypto Wave has indicated that Ethereum could witness another significant price crash, presenting a bearish outlook for the altcoin. This price crash is expected to mark Wave C of a corrective move, with ETH dropping to as low as $1,800. Why Ethereum Could Still Drop To As Low As $1,800 In an X post, Crypto Wave declared that the primary expectation remains that Ethereum will see one more leg down in wave c of wave 2, targeting the zone between $1,950 and $1,700. Specifically, his accompanying chart showed that the largest altcoin by market cap could drop to around $1,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000? The crypto analyst revealed that Ethereum has already hit the 0.5 fib retracement at $2,100, which is the minimum target for a Wave 2 correction. However, structurally, he claimed that this drop still looks like wave A only. Crypto Wave further explained that these ABC corrections are always three-part moves, and that is what he sees forming now for ETH. The broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin, has bounced back following the ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Ethereum has also rebounded, having dropped to as low as $2,100 last week. However, Crypto Wave suggested that the current market sentiment doesn\u2019t invalidate this bearish setup for ETH and that it could still witness a deeper sell-off. The crypto analyst alluded to the fourth quarter of last year when Ethereum was underperforming heavily while many altcoins rallied. In line with this, he remarked that there could be a repeat of this scenario. However, on the other hand, Crypto Wave claimed that if ETH breaks above $2,880 impulsively, especially in one clean wave, then the correction could be over. He added that this would also put the altcoin in the early stages of a new bull cycle. 2021 Pattern Playing Out For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Merlijn drew similarities between the current Ethereum price action and that of 2021. He stated that the 2021 playbook is repeating, with ETH having a dead count bounce, then a final retest before the parabolic leg. The analyst expects the altcoin to retest the $2,000 level before the massive move to the upside. Related Reading: Market Expert Who Predicted Ethereum Price Crash At $2,800 Reveals What\u2019s Coming Next His accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could rally to as high as $11,000 on this uptrend. Merlijn had remarked that ETH has more firepower this time around than in 2021, which is why the altcoin could witness such a parabolic move to the upside. Interestingly, based on the chart, this rally is expected to happen between now and year-end. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,480, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "XRP is showing all the signs of a move brewing, and the chart doesn&#8217;t lie. After a period of consolidation, price action is tightening, and technical indicators are flashing signals of an impending move. Whether it&#8217;s a surge to the upside or a sharp reversal, the setup is in place, and momentum is building. XRP looks loaded and ready to make its next move. Volume Remains Subdued \u2014 Calm Before The Storm? XRP price remains trapped inside a long-standing triangle, a pattern known for building pressure before sharp directional moves. The chart shows that sellers continue to push lower highs, compressing price action toward a support level. Related Reading: XRP Price Trades Sideways \u2014 Bulls Preparing for Next Push? Parshwa Turakhiya pointed out on X that the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) cluster between $2.17 and $2.23 is the key breakout zone capping any upward momentum. A clean break above this range could trigger a bullish reversal. On the other hand, $2.09 is the last line of defense for the bulls. If this level fails, the structure breaks down, and XRP could swiftly drop to $1.85. Despite the building tension, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, which Parshwa Turakhiya describes as &#8220;the calm before the volatility storm.&#8221; The chart structure suggests that a move is imminent. With early July just ahead, Parshwa Turakhiya warns that a breakout or breakdown is coming, and it won&#8217;t be subtle. XRP is on the edge of eruption. Fabio Zuccara stated that Dr. Profit, known for his sharp and historically accurate calls on XRP at $0.15, $0.38, and $0.50, has now projected a new mid-term target of $4.00. In a weekly chart shared via social media, XRP is forming a bullish structure, with a green arrow projecting a continuation move to the upside. Zuccara outlined a crucial level for maintaining the bullish trajectory. This rebound adds strength to the outlook, suggesting that momentum is building in favor of the bulls. In the same vein, SquirtleCharts revealed that XRP&#8217;s 4-hour chart has mapped out a precise path toward $3.00 target, with several resistance levels standing in the way, and each level varies in difficulty. The first is $2.22, the easy one, a weak resistance point that XRP could clear without much effort. Next is $2.33, which SquirtleCharts labels as &#8220;a lot harder,&#8221; signaling a barrier that may require volume and conviction to break. The $2.48 level is &#8220;not too bad,&#8221; a moderate resistance area that might slow the rally but not be a roadblock. Finally, the $2.65 is the &#8220;pretty hard,&#8221; a zone where bulls may face challenges. Perfect Technical Structure Sets Stage For Explosive Breakout Massive move incoming for XRP. After a clean bounce off the $2.00 support level, the setup is aligning perfectly on the daily chart. Related Reading: XRP Pullback Nearly Complete\u2014Next Stop: $8 To $12, Says Analyst Sara emphasizes that the chart structure looks flawless, with price action respecting critical zones and now coiling for an explosive breakout, with momentum building and bulls defending the support zone.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-reclaims-2444-level-bullish-continuation-in-focus/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has bounced back sharply, reclaiming the $2,400 level after a volatile week marked by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Last weekend, ETH briefly dipped below the $2,200 mark as panic selling swept across global markets following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The sell-off triggered a sharp fakeout that briefly pushed ETH out of its multi-week trading range. However, bulls are regaining control, and Ethereum\u2019s price action now signals the early stages of a potential recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 \u2013 Bullish Momentum Builds Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is reclaiming the key $2,444 resistance level \u2014 a zone that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout May and June. If bulls maintain momentum above this threshold, it could open the door for a bullish continuation toward the higher end of the established range. While uncertainty remains due to lingering macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, Ethereum\u2019s current structure shows renewed strength. Market participants are watching closely, as ETH often serves as a leading indicator for broader altcoin performance. Holding above $2,400 could become a catalyst for a broader rally, especially if Bitcoin continues to stabilize and approach new all-time highs. Ethereum Battles For Breakout As Market Awaits Direction Ethereum is trading at a critical juncture after a turbulent week of price action driven by geopolitical instability and macroeconomic uncertainty. Following a sharp drop below $2,200 amid panic selling over the Middle East conflict escalation, ETH has recovered significantly, now hovering around the $2,444 level. This price zone is key, not only as a technical resistance but also as a sentiment marker for traders watching for signs of a trend reversal or confirmation of a deeper pullback. Analysts remain divided on what comes next. Some believe Ethereum\u2019s recent recovery could signal the beginning of a bullish continuation, especially if price action holds and pushes above the upper range levels near $2,600. A breakout from this zone would indicate renewed strength and could set the tone for a broader altcoin rally, particularly as Ethereum often leads sector momentum. Others, however, warn that the recovery might be short-lived, and a retreat to lower demand zones could occur if macro conditions worsen. Ted Pillows notes that Ethereum is currently reclaiming the $2,444 resistance level. He emphasizes that bullish continuation into the range highs is necessary to confirm breakout strength. Until then, traders are watching closely, as any rejection at this level could shift momentum back to the downside. With global tensions and monetary tightening from central banks continuing to influence markets, the coming weeks may determine whether ETH enters a new uptrend or retreats further into its long-standing consolidation range. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure \u2013 Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25\u2013$30 Surge ETH Faces Long-Term Resistance The weekly chart of Ethereum (ETH/USD) shows a strong recovery from the $2,189 low, with ETH currently trading at $2,463 \u2014 a 10.5% gain so far this week. This sharp bounce comes after a fakeout below the $2,200 level and suggests renewed buying pressure following recent geopolitical volatility. However, price is now testing a major confluence zone formed by the 50-week ($2,660), 100-week ($2,625), and 200-week ($2,437) simple moving averages. This cluster of moving averages is acting as resistance, capping ETH\u2019s upside momentum. Historically, when Ethereum breaks through these long-term trend lines, a significant trend continuation follows. But for now, bulls must decisively clear this $2,450\u2013$2,660 zone to confirm a breakout and open the door toward the $3,000 psychological level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply Volume has slightly increased, indicating rising interest, but the rejection wicks from prior weekly candles suggest the market remains indecisive. As long as ETH holds above the 200-week SMA ($2,437), the structure remains constructive, but a breakdown below it would likely reintroduce bearish sentiment.

      "title": "Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-bitcoin-top-in/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is starting to inch closer toward $110,000 again, recently pushing to an intraday high of $108,116 and now steadily trading above $107,000. Despite the retracement below $99,000 in the past week, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price action shows that the broader market is still bullish. Notably, the recent price action in the past 24 hours is beginning to quiet questions about whether Bitcoin has already reached its top for this cycle. The MVRV Z-Score may be offering a clear answer, and it points in a very different direction from what some might expect. MVRV Z-Score Says Bitcoin Has Room To Run According to crypto analyst Doctor Profit, who initially posted an on-chain analysis of Bitcoin on the social media platform X, the MVRV Z-Score indicates that BTC is still far from its cycle top. The MVRV Z-Score is an established on-chain metric used to determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Is In And Price Is Headed For $92,000, Analyst Warns As pointed out by the analyst, the current level on the MVRV Z-Score metric is only slightly above 2, which has been a relatively neutral zone since Bitcoin&#8217;s creation. Bitcoin only reached its major tops in past cycles when this metric climbed into the red zone and above a value of around 8 and above. The overall Bitcoin price chart shared by Doctor Profit supports this claim. Peaks in the orange MVRV Z-Score line are shown with red shaded zones in the chart below. These red zones have aligned almost perfectly with Bitcoin&#8217;s price tops in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021. On the other hand, despite the recent surge to new all-time highs in May, the current cycle has yet to push BItcoin&#8217;s price into that overheated region. Instead, the chart shows the Z-Score still in a much lower band. This boils down to show that the Bitcoin price could have a very significant upside left. MVRV vs Price: What The Current Setup Means For Bitcoin One detail that stands out in the current cycle is the pattern of lower highs forming in the MVRV Z-Score, as seen in the chart. Unlike in old cycles, where the metric surged into extreme overvaluation zones above 10, the most recent peaks have been noticeably more subdued. This trend could be interpreted as a signal that the market is beginning to mature or that Bitcoin may even already be approaching the peak of its current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align However, although this pattern is worth keeping an eye on, it is far from conclusive. The only conclusive fact is that Bitcoin&#8217;s price has never reached a definitive cycle top until the MVRV Z-Score has pushed into the red zone, which it has yet to do this time around. Although there isn&#8217;t a set price peak from the metric, other analysts have offered a wide range of predictions for where it might land. Predictions of Bitcoin price peaks range anywhere from $150,000 to as high as $500,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,740, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/179000-or-79000-bitcoin-critical-cycle-pivot/",
      "summary": "A popular crypto analyst has issued a stark cyclical warning that could define Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory for the rest of the summer. Dr. Cat, known for his integrated use of Ichimoku Cloud analysis, Elliott Wave Theory, and proprietary time-cycle forecasting, posted an intricate scenario on X suggesting Bitcoin now stands at a pivotal inflection point\u2014one that may ultimately determine whether the next major move is to $179,000 or back down to $79,000. Bitcoin Faces Make-or-Break Moment \u201cIf we set a daily high between the 25th and 27th of June,\u201d Dr. Cat began, referencing the window derived from his Time Theory model, \u201cand it turns out to be a lower high per the Wave Theory, then a lower low should follow.\u201d The implications, however, go far beyond near-term downside. \u201cIf a lower low comes, we invalidate the weekly cycle which implies no bottom before mid-July to mid-August.\u201d According to the forecast timeline, the earliest potential bottom would fall between July 14 and August 17, with a primary target range from July 28 to August 3, incorporating a \u00b12 week deviation. That timing model dovetails with the chart\u2019s behavior around critical Ichimoku levels. Dr. Cat emphasized that Bitcoin is currently \u201cmaking a bearish retest of the weekly Tenkan Sen,\u201d adding that yesterday&#8217;s attempt to reclaim that level failed: \u201cPrice touched Tenkan Sen yesterday but I saw that it would open below it today.\u201d Related Reading: Trump\u2019s Truth Social Officialy Files For Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs With NYSE The Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen\u2014two key lines in the Ichimoku system\u2014are not just flat; they are structurally unconvincing despite a nominal 10% price advance. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a real uptrend,\u201d noted one user, to which Dr. Cat replied: \u201cThis is simply a neutral chart trying to flip bullish.\u201d He elaborated that this neutrality means neither bullish nor bearish continuation is guaranteed, but warned that inaction or false optimism at this stage could expose traders to a cascading downside. One of the most significant technical levels lies just beneath current price. \u201cThe super key support of 93.2K (weekly Kijun Sen) is relatively close\u2014and too close to hold if the time cycles play out,\u201d Dr. Cat stated. A failure of that level would likely trigger a deeper reversion to the 3-week Kijun Sen, which remains unvisited and is currently positioned near $75K but rising. The entire bearish cascade remains \u201ccompletely valid and with a very real chance of playing out,\u201d unless Bitcoin manages to break above $110.6K after June 27. Such a move would invalidate both the time and wave-based lower-high structure and neutralize the scenario before it unfolds. But until then, Dr. Cat is urging traders to look beyond surface-level price movements. \u201cMost people look at whether price goes up or down but don\u2019t look at how it does it,\u201d he said. Recalling his accurate bullish stance in April and May\u2014when others were waiting for retracement\u2014and his caution in early June, he emphasized the importance of reading the structure, not just the candles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern\u2014Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead \u201cThe weekly chart was one candle away from a bullish TK cross, which would\u2019ve implied big bullish continuation. But I waited. Then the market dumped,\u201d he reminded followers. \u201cNow it is relatively similar\u2026 dramatic reversals happen as close to invalidation as possible so everyone is tested and trapped to the limit.\u201d In summary, Dr. Cat\u2019s outlook remains balanced\u2014but volatile. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you I can read the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that you need to distinguish neutral from bullish charts, which many people can\u2019t\u2014and suffer the consequences.\u201d With time cycles converging and Ichimoku structures flashing indecision, Bitcoin now stands at a binary junction. The next high or low could lock in a multi-week trend, with targets as distant as $179K\u2014or as painful as $79K\u2014hanging in the balance. \u201cThis is simply a neutral chart trying to flip bullish. Which can certainly flip bullish pretty soon but until that happens I discuss whether first comes 179K or 79K with pretty much equal probability and I&#8217;m warning about an absolutely valid scenario which is on the table unless the chart flips bullish,\u201d Dr. Cat concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $107,356. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
