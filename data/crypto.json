      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-sopr-signals-more-gains-ahead-despite-new-ath-analyst/",
      "summary": "In the past week, Bitcoin has grabbed the major headlines as prices surge to a new all-time high of $118,856 following a market gain of 9.77%. In remarkable fashion, the premier cryptocurrency added an estimated $10,000 to its market value increasing its market cap to a solid $2.34 trillion. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggest there may be more tailwind ahead backing Bitcoin\u2019s ability to explore new price territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000\u2014But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns STH SOPR Sits At 1.02, Suggests Market Not Overheating In a recent quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a market analyst with username CryptoMe has shared some compelling insights on Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory amidst current market euphoria. As earlier stated, the flagship cryptocurrency experienced a significant price gain to brush nearly against the $120,000 mark. Despite this rise, CryptoMe notes that short-term holders&#8217; spent output profit ratio (STH SOPR) indicates that this class of investors are yet to engage in significant profit-taking. For context, The STH-SOPR measures the ratio of realized profits or losses by investors who\u2019ve held BTC for less than 155 days. A STH-SOPR reading above 1.0 indicates that BTC are being sold at a profit, while values below 1.0 indicate losses. Based on the chart below, sharp increases in this on-chain metric especially into the 1.05-1.20+ range (red zone) have correlated with profit-taking phases and can often precede local tops. However, the STH-SOPR currently sits at 1.02, suggesting that although some short-term holders are in profit, no aggressive market distribution has commenced. This development is particularly bullish considering the STH realized price is presently at $100,000 indicating these investors are 17%-18% in profit and are opting to hold for further price gains. Meanwhile, the analyst notes that this present on-chain situation aligns with the broader sentiment in the derivatives market. Open Interest is climbing, signaling growing participation, but funding rates remain neutral to slightly positive. This lack of extreme funding imbalances suggests that traders are not flooding the market with overleveraged long positions due to FOMO. CryptoMe explains that all these factors indicate the Bitcoin market is far from overheating and there is still potential for more growth ahead.

Meanwhile, the asset\u2019s daily trading volume is up by 96.53% indicating a strong market activity behind the ongoing rally backing the potential for a continuation.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst TradingShot has drawn attention to a bullish pattern for Dogecoin, indicating that a significant price surge is on the horizon. The analyst suggested that this could be the final leg up for the foremost meme coin and advised market participants not to miss it. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally With Megaphone Pattern In a TradingView post, TradingShot predicted that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $1.25. He noted that the meme coin has been trading in a bullish Megaphone pattern within a channel up. The analyst added that the recent rebound on June 16 on the weekly MA200 is a higher low at the bottom of both patterns. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price To Jump Double-Digits To $0.2 With the 1-week Relative Strength Index (RSI) also rebounding on its long-term support zone, TradingShot declared that Dogecoin is most likely at the start of a new bullish leg. He noted that this could be the final rally that will shape this cycle\u2019s top. Meanwhile, the analyst claimed that DOGE is targeting $1.25 because the previous two bullish legs peaked on the 3.618 Fibonacci extension of the last decline. He told market participants that they can settle for $0.8 if they wish to pursue a target within the Channel up. A rally to both $0.8 and $1.25 would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for Dogecoin, whose current ATH is at $0.73. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach these targets in the first half of next year. Dogecoin is expected to maintain a steady climb from now till then as it reaches those targets. The meme coin has already begun another uptrend following Bitcoin\u2019s rally to a new ATH. DOGE has again reclaimed the $ 0.20 psychological price level and could potentially reach its last local high at around $0.26. DOGE Against Its Bitcoin Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support with the monthly time frame indicators fully reset. The analyst indicated that this was possibly the best setup for Dogecoin, one that could spark a massive run for the meme coin. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline Meanwhile, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the Dogecoin-to-Bitcoin chart might show a God candle this month.

The analyst\u2019s accompanying chart showed that DOGE could rally to as high as $9 during this period. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $0.2 support level as being crucial for this lift-off for the meme coin.

      "summary": "In line with a bullish trading week, Sui (SUI) prices soared by over 20% reaching a local peak of $3.54 before experiencing a slight retracement. The prominent altcoin, which is tipped to be a major player in a potential altseason, has maintained a remarkable price performance in the present market cycle rising by 352.04% in the last year alone. Based on technical indicators, renowned market analyst Ted Pillows postulates SUI may be gearing up for parabolic rally following recent market gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Through 50EMA After Rejection, ETH Dominance Sees Resurgence SUI Market Structure Signals Potential Breakout In an X post on July 11, Ted Pillows shares an insightful price analysis on the SUI market identifying a series of technical signals that precedes explosive market gains. These include a well-defined price movement within a well-defined ascending channel on the weekly timeframe, combined with an imminent bullish MACD crossover. In analyzing the ascending price channel, SUI has shown a strict adherence to both resistance and support zones. Notably, a healthy correction from its previous highs near $5.00 resulted in the altcoin finding support around $2.50 before initiating another rebound. As the altcoin presently consolidates, historical data indicates a potential return to the channel upper\u2019s boundary between $10.50 and $13.00. However, the major strength in Pillows\u2019 bullish thesis is the MACD setup that shows an impending bullish crossover i.e. when the MACD line (white) crosses above the signal line (orange), often interpreted by traders as an early sign of trend reversal or strengthening bullish momentum. Historically, the last time a decisive bullish MACD cross occurred on the weekly chart, it induced a six-month rally that delivered over 400% in gains. Going by this precedent, SUI bulls may be eying a potential price target of $13.76 by end of 2025. Related Reading: SUI Explodes Higher, Climbing Above 20-Day MA \u2014 But Can The Rally Hold? SUI Market Overview At the time of writing, SUI trades at $3.42 reflecting a 1.16% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the market trading volume is up by 17.68% and valued at $1.95 billion. On a monthly scale, SUI has recorded a marginal loss of 0.11%, suggesting that bearish forces still maintain a subtle grip on the market. Nevertheless, data from CoinMarketCap shows the Sui community remains bullish on the altcoin\u2019s future. Contributors to this market optimism includes the potential of SUI spot ETF following applications by prominent asset managers such as Grayscale, Canary Capital and 21 Shares. Meanwhile, the potential of an altseason remains valid amidst continuous speculations by market analysts. As earlier stated, SUI&#8217;s strong price history and growing recognition places the cryptocurrency as a major frontrunner in any altcoin market run.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dominance-continues-historic-climb-altcoins-struggle-to-gain-ground/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has officially entered a new chapter in its bull market, surging to fresh all-time highs near $118,800 after weeks of tight consolidation. This decisive breakout marks a pivotal shift in momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential explosive leg higher as bullish sentiment returns. The move above previous highs has not only reignited interest in BTC but also fueled optimism across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 \u2013 Price Magnet Forming One of the most telling indicators of the current cycle\u2019s strength is Bitcoin Dominance. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, BTC dominance has climbed to 65% since the beginning of this bull market. This sharp increase highlights a clear preference among investors for Bitcoin over altcoins, solidifying its position as the market\u2019s anchor in times of volatility and growth. As Bitcoin leads the charge, market watchers believe the breakout could trigger a wave of institutional inflows and renewed attention from sidelined retail investors. With momentum building and confidence growing, the breakout above $118K may just be the start of an even larger move, one that could define the next phase of the 2025 crypto bull cycle. Bitcoin Leads The Charge After weeks of sideways consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, launching a new bullish phase and pushing the broader crypto market into motion. Altcoins, which had lagged in recent months, are now climbing above key resistance levels as confidence spreads. This coordinated move comes amid a backdrop of macroeconomic shifts, with market participants increasingly anticipating a weakening US dollar and the return of inflationary policies under US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. With expectations of rate cuts looming and pressure mounting on the Federal Reserve, the market sees crypto\u2014especially Bitcoin\u2014as a natural hedge. However, caution still lingers. US Treasury yields remain elevated, continuing to flash warnings of systemic stress in the traditional financial system. That tension has only strengthened Bitcoin\u2019s appeal as a non-sovereign, hard-capped monetary asset. Bitcoin dominance tells the story clearly. \u201cAt the start of this bull market, it sat at 40%. Today? 65%,\u201d noted On-Chain Mind, emphasizing how investor preference has overwhelmingly leaned toward BTC. This dominance reflects a trend that has barely flinched, even as Ethereum and other altcoins attempt to catch up. As BTC leads the market higher, its dominance reinforces its role as the primary beneficiary of macro uncertainty. While the altcoin space is beginning to show signs of life, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin remains the anchor, and investors aren\u2019t ready to rotate just yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 \u2013 Details 4\u2011Hour Chart: Post\u2011Breakout Cooling Bitcoin\u2019s 4-hour chart shows a clean breakout followed by consolidation, a typical sign of strength after an impulsive move. Price surged from the long-standing resistance at $109,300 to a local high of $118,000 in less than twelve hours, marking an 8% rally. This breakout flipped prior resistance into support and triggered strong volume, validating the move. Volume has decreased during this period, which is characteristic of a bullish consolidation rather than distribution. The 50-period moving average (blue) has crossed above the 100-period (green), forming a short-term golden cross near $109K. This crossover supports a bullish outlook, with the 200-period moving average (red) trending upward from $105K, reinforcing the structure of higher lows. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level \u2013 Relief Or Reversal? As long as Bitcoin remains above $112K, bulls are firmly in control. A drop below $109K would invalidate the breakout and raise short-term risks. However, if price can break above $118K with conviction, it could open the door to a run toward the $120K psychological level. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Ethereum has finally broken above the critical $2,850 level, igniting momentum across the broader altcoin market. After weeks of sideways trading, this breakout marks a potential turning point, as many altcoins followed ETH\u2019s lead with sharp upward moves. Analysts are calling this shift the early stages of a new altseason \u2014 a period where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin and deliver significant gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 \u2013 Details Among those spotlighting Ethereum\u2019s strength is Ryan Sean Adams, founder of Mythos Capital, who took to X to highlight the strategic evolution of Ethereum\u2019s positioning. \u201cThe ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months,\u201d he wrote, referring to his earlier thesis of Ethereum as a global, productive asset. This renewed narrative, focused on Ethereum as a yield-generating, store-of-value asset backed by an active economy, appears to be resonating with institutional and retail investors alike. With Ethereum leading the market and altcoins gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether this rally can sustain and confirm the start of a broader bullish phase for the crypto market. Ethereum Undervaluation Sparks New Narrative Since 2022, Ethereum has been underperforming against Bitcoin, with altcoins suffering as a result. While Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto narrative \u2014 recently breaking into new all-time highs \u2014 Ethereum still trades more than 60% below its November 2021 peak. This stark divergence has frustrated many ETH holders, but some analysts and investors now view it as a massive opportunity. Adams has become a prominent voice in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, and believes a major shift is already underway. According to Adams, the Ethereum community has successfully rebranded ETH as a \u201cblue money\u201d asset \u2014 a concept that positions Ethereum alongside traditional stores of value like gold, oil, and Bitcoin. But unlike those, ETH is backed by an on-chain economy that generates yield. \u201cWe are emphasizing ETH, the asset now,\u201d Adams wrote on X. \u201cIt\u2019s made a huge difference. Keep going. ETH = world reserve asset.\u201d His bold, almost maximalist stance is a call for the market to reassess Ethereum\u2019s fundamental value. Rather than seeing it solely as infrastructure for decentralized apps, Adams argues that Ethereum is maturing into a globally viable reserve asset \u2014 one that offers both security and yield. If that narrative continues gaining traction, ETH could be poised for a major revaluation in the months ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 \u2013 Price Magnet Forming ETH Reclaims Key Level As Bulls Regain Control Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength, surging nearly 15% on the week to trade around $2,955. This marks a successful breakout above the key resistance zone at $2,850, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout the past two years. The weekly candle shows strong bullish momentum, supported by a significant increase in trading volume. The chart reveals that ETH has now reclaimed the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, which sit at $2,644 and $2,428, respectively. Reclaiming these long-term averages is a strong technical signal that the downtrend may be over, and a new bullish phase could be starting. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level \u2013 Relief Or Reversal? Despite the breakout, Ethereum is still trading far below its all-time high near $4,900. This presents upside potential if the bullish momentum continues. With this breakout, ETH also confirms a higher low structure, reinforcing the bullish case for further gains. If price holds above $2,850 in the coming days, the next resistance zone sits around $3,300\u2013$3,600. A close above those levels could open the door to a rally toward $4,000 and beyond.
