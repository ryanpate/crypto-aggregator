      "summary": "Senator Cynthia Lummis, who leads the Senate Subcommittee on Digital Assets, says the US military backs a plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of a major bank, recently called that plan a waste. Lummis pushed back. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Lummis told Bloomberg the military thinks having Bitcoin on hand matters. She said it could be a tool in the economic contest with China. Some see that as a bold step. Others say it\u2019s risky. Military Backs Bitcoin Reserve According to the senator, military leaders say Bitcoin could help in an economic showdown. They see it as a way to hold value if traditional assets get hit by sanctions or big moves from other nations. She spoke about weapons and ammunitions being part of national security, but she added that a Bitcoin reserve is also vital. Some military voices have warned that future conflicts won\u2019t just be fought on battlefields. Money and digital assets could play a key role too. Legislative And Executive Moves Based on reports, Lummis introduced a bill to have the US buy and hold 1 million BTC. That would mirror what countries do with gold. The idea is to pull funds from the Treasury or Federal Reserve rather than use new budget money. It has not moved far in Congress. Still, US President Donald Trump issued an order on March 6, 2025, to set up a Bitcoin reserve plus a digital asset stockpile for other coins. He said the government would use assets seized in civil and criminal actions to start the fund. That means some 200,000 BTC the government already has could be part of it. Lummis Sees Bitcoin Price Rising In The Next Decade Lummis unveiled a proprietary model forecasting a dramatic rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price over the next decade, citing factors such as its fixed supply, growing institutional adoption, and expanding network effects. Analysts caution that such long-term forecasts hinge on unpredictable factors like regulatory shifts, technological breakthroughs, and market sentiment, any of which could derail even the most optimistic projections. She also praised Trump for pushing simple rules for crypto and for using digital coins as part of national strategy. Trump\u2019s family runs a DeFi platform, a stablecoin project, and even some meme coins. Lummis thinks everyone will end up in the crypto economy sooner or later. Related Reading: $500M Bet On Solana: Education Platform Aims To Supercharge Its Treasury Skeptic Voices And Uncertain Path Jamie Dimon disagrees. He calls the Bitcoin reserve a waste of resources. Other experts worry about Bitcoin\u2019s ups and downs. They say a strategic reserve shouldn\u2019t ride on something that can swing 20% in a single day. Some economists at top universities give zero support to borrowing money to build a crypto stash. They argue it doesn\u2019t make sense against the US\u2019s nearly $36 trillion national debt. For now, the bill to buy 1 million BTC sits in committee. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Bitcoin is experiencing a short-term price decline. In the past 24 hours, the asset has fallen by approximately 9.3% to a trading value of $105,062. This pullback places Bitcoin roughly 8% below its all-time high recorded last month. The dip comes amid broader market volatility, but on-chain indicators and exchange data suggest deeper structural trends that may influence the next phase of Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory. Recent market analysis points to renewed accumulation among long-term holders, a spike in exchange withdrawals, and rising spot trading activity on Binance. These developments are being interpreted as signals of underlying strength despite recent price weakness. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha has provided a detailed breakdown of these emerging patterns, offering a perspective on how long-term dynamics may be shaping Bitcoin\u2019s current market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3\u20135 Year Holders Slow Selloff\u2014Waiting for Higher Prices? Binance Trading Volume Rises, Long-Term Holders Accumulate Since early June, Binance has seen its share of Bitcoin spot trading volume increase from 26% to 35%, positioning it more firmly as the dominant platform in the market. This increase in trading activity has occurred as Bitcoin approaches and tests key price levels. According to Taha, this surge may indicate renewed interest from retail and institutional traders alike, particularly as volatility draws more short-term market participants to major exchanges. In addition to exchange volume shifts, on-chain data reveals growing confidence among long-term Bitcoin holders. The Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap, a metric that reflects the value of coins held by entities with a holding period of over 155 days, has returned above $20 billion. Historically, this type of accumulation pattern has preceded periods of price expansion, as long-term investors tend to hold through corrections and avoid frequent selling. The rise in LTH realized cap suggests these entities are not exiting positions during this market dip, which may reduce available supply and support future upward movement. Bitcoin Large Exchange Withdrawals Signal Tightening Supply Beyond trading activity and holder behavior, Taha pointed out that another notable trend is emerging on centralized exchanges. Over a two-day period, Kraken and Bitfinex recorded net Bitcoin outflows exceeding 20,000 BTC, among the largest short-term withdrawals in recent months. Such movements are often interpreted as signals of investors shifting assets into self-custody, possibly in anticipation of long-term holding or strategic redeployment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go \u2018Bananas\u2019 If Price Closes Above This Level, Top Analyst Says Combined, the rise in Binance\u2019s market share, increased LTH accumulation, and exchange outflows present a picture of a market undergoing structural positioning rather than widespread exit activity. While the short-term price trend reflects a pullback from recent highs, the simultaneous withdrawal of supply and steady long-term holder confidence could act as foundational elements for potential future growth.
