In that sense, traders should closely monitor any bullish price action close to the $2.35 area, and an hourly close above this level as potential confirmation.

However, at that time, the cryptocurrency failed to achieve the $2.35 breakout and continued trading in a tight channel between this level and $2.13. A separate analyst believes that XRP is close to a rally and placed the target above Martinez\u2019s claiming that the cryptocurrency could hit $2.69 on short timeframes. For this analyst, a breakout above $2.4 holds the key to future gains. The analyst stated: $XRP strength is telling. Something is brewing What\u2019s Behind the Momentum? The XRP price positive performance could be attributed to the massive inflow of capital coming into its ecosystem.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-another-460-run-rare-fiat-signal-returned/",
      "summary": "The Global Money Supply has just hit a rare yearly growth rate of 9%. Here&#8217;s what followed for Bitcoin the last few times this signal appeared. Global Money Supply Is Currently Sharply Going Up In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about the latest trend in the Global Money Supply. The &#8220;Global Money Supply&#8221; refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of fiat supply (priced in US Dollars) issued by the top countries around the world. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins\u201462% Held By Just 10 Whales Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the data for the year-on-year growth in the metric: As displayed in the graph, the metric&#8217;s value has recently been witnessing an increase, indicating that fiat supply is going up. &#8220;Central banks are flooding the market with fiat money,&#8221; notes the analyst. Currently, the indicator stands at around 9%, which corresponds to the Global Money Supply undergoing a 9% jump over the last twelve months. &#8220;This is extreme and rare,&#8221; says Edwards. In the same chart, the Capriole Investments founder has also attached the historical data of the daily Bitcoin price. Interestingly, past surges of the metric to this level all preceded significant bull rallies for the cryptocurrency over the next twelve months. More specifically, the August 2017 signal led to a 663% surge, the November 2017 one to a 136% increase, and the June 2020 one to a 580% rally. This comes to an average gain of 460%. Thus, it would appear that money printers being busy around the world is something that tends to be bullish for Bitcoin. Considering that the Global Money Supply is once again rising at an appreciable rate, it only remains to be seen whether BTC will once again feel a positive effect over the coming year. In some other news, the Bitcoin network recently saw its largest ever movement of coins older than ten years, as CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has pointed out in an X post. In total, this latest spike of transactions involving ancient coins saw the movement of around 81,000 BTC, worth a whopping $8.8 billion. Generally, old coins move when they are being sold, so these transfers could correspond to profit-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report Interestingly, the Apparent Demand indicator has remained positive for Bitcoin even after these transactions, as Edwards has explained in another X post. This metric gauges the demand for Bitcoin by comparing its production (mining issuance) against its inventory (supply inactive over 1 year). &#8220;Despite 80,000 BTC moving, Bitcoin&#8217;s Apparent Demand is still bullish,&#8221; says the analyst.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-heating-up-nvt-golden-cross-hints-at-potential-local-top/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7% over the last two weeks, showing signs of strength despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. However, some indicators suggest that the market may be entering overheating territory. Bitcoin Market Entering Overheating Territory? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Golden Cross is on the rise. Importantly, this upward movement is beginning to signal signs of market overheating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is a technical indicator that compares short-term and long-term moving averages of the NVT ratio to identify potential market tops or bottoms. When the short-term NVT crosses above the long-term average, it often signals that Bitcoin is becoming overvalued and may face a short-term correction. Notably, this indicator has successfully predicted three local tops so far in 2025. The first occurred on February 5, when the NVT Golden Cross hit 2.68 while BTC traded at $97,600, followed by a 23.65% correction. On March 24, the indicator peaked at 2.87 with BTC around $87,500, leading to a subsequent correction of 16.06%. Most recently &#8211; on June 16 &#8211; it rose to 2.21 with BTC trading at $106,800, which was followed by a 9.87% price dip. Currently, the NVT Golden Cross stands at 1.98. Although it hasn\u2019t crossed the key 2.2 threshold yet, its upward trajectory suggests that market overheating could be brewing. The CryptoQuant analyst explained: Breaking its previous high is moderately bullish and shows momentum is building. If the metric crosses 2.2 again, it may hint at a local top. But don\u2019t rush to exit &#8211; historically, the metric has stayed above 2.2 for several days. In conclusion, burakkesmeci noted that while crossing the 2.2 level might suggest Bitcoin is heating up in the short-term, it could also signal a return of bullish momentum in the medium-term. That said, the opinion on BTC&#8217;s short-term price trajectory is largely divided. Analysts Split Over BTC Price Action \u200b\u200bThe NVT Golden Cross suggests that BTC may still have room to rally before hitting a potential local top. However, some analysts foresee a short-term pullback before Bitcoin reaches new highs.

For instance, noted crypto analyst Chistian Chifoi described the current BTC price action as a \u201cdeceptive setup,\u201d warning it may trap bulls before a possible surge toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $160,000.
