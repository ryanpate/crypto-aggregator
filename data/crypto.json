      "summary": "Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has warned about a potential crash for the Bitcoin price, after the flagship crypto closed below a critical resistance level. The analyst also highlighted the level that BTC needs to reclaim to invalidate this bearish setup. Bitcoin Price Risks Crash With Weekly Close Below Resistance In an X post, Rekt Capital revealed that the Bitcoin price has closed below the final major weekly resistance at around $108,890. Based on this, he remarked that a possible early-stage Lower High resistance may be developing at around $107,720, with BTC at risk of crashing. The analyst added that Bitcoin will need to reclaim $108,890 as support on the daily to invalidate this Lower High. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs In an earlier X post, Rekt Capital highlighted how significant it would have been if the Bitcoin price had closed above this final major weekly resistance. He noted that BTC had never performed such a weekly close. As such, if that had happened last week, he claimed it would not only be \u201chistoric\u201d but would enable BTC to enjoy a new uptrend into new all-time highs (ATHs). However, the Bitcoin price now appears to be on a downtrend, having failed to hold above the $107,720 level successfully. BTC had reached an intraday high of $107,970 but has since then been on a decline and is now at risk of losing the $106,800 macro level. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has warned that BTC being below this level puts it in the danger zone. Meanwhile, based on historical bull market cycles, Rekt Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still has some more upside left. In an X post, he stated that history suggests that Bitcoin may end its bull market in two to three months. BTC Still Fuel In The Tank Despite the recent Bitcoin price drop, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto declared that the flagship crypto still has fuel in the tank. He claimed that the weekly market structure remains strong with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The analyst added that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pushing towards its trendline.

He alluded to dojis that had formed for the flagship crypto in its current corrective channel and declared they were bullish for Bitcoin.

      "summary": "After rebounding from a local bottom of around $75,000 in April, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be stuck in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, showing little indication of a clear directional trend. One key data point reflecting this indecision is Bitcoin\u2019s network volume. Bitcoin Network Volume Stuck In Balance Zone According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, Bitcoin\u2019s network volume has stabilized in a state of &#8216;stable equilibrium,&#8217; reminiscent of the mid-2021 consolidation phase that preceded a major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, Bitcoin network volume refers to the total value of BTC transferred across the blockchain over a specific period, typically used to gauge market activity and capital flow. Higher network volume suggests increased investor engagement and liquidity, while lower volume may indicate reduced interest or market stagnation. Notably, when BTC reached the upper end of its current range &#8211; around $110,000 &#8211; its average network volume surged to as high as $67 billion. Since then, the metric has slightly declined and now hovers around $58.7 billion. Since January 2024, Bitcoin\u2019s average network volume has ranged between $40 billion and $80 billion. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this corridor has become a key indicator of network activity balance and broader market sentiment. Historically, when the Bitcoin average volume approached the upper-end of the range at $80 billion, it coincided with local price peaks of $70,000 and $100,000. On the contrary, moves toward the lower-end &#8211; around $40 billion &#8211; were associated with short-term pullbacks, though these dips were often quickly bought up by market participants. Currently, the $58.7 billion reading sits near the midpoint of this range, mirroring the consolidation phase observed in mid-2021. The analyst explained: As long as the indicator remains above the $40 billion level, we can speak of a stable fundamental market condition. Rising volumes above the $80 billion mark will confirm strengthening activity and fresh capital inflow. On the other hand, a sustained drop below $40 billion will indicate weakening network demand and may be a harbinger of a deeper correction. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? While Bitcoin network volume suggests the market is in a state of equilibrium, some on-chain metrics hint at a potential breakout building in the background &#8211; possibly paving the way for renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall For example, the BTC short-term holder floor has been rising steadily in recent months, currently hovering around $98,000. This provides a strong support base, potentially preventing a sharp downside correction. However, selling pressure from miners and long-term holders is also beginning to increase &#8211; casting some uncertainty over BTC\u2019s short-term price trajectory.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-break-above-108500/",
      "summary": "A crypto analyst has forecasted a powerful Wave 3 Bitcoin price rally that could take it toward new all-time highs between $160,000 and $200,000. Notably, this surge is expected to come with rising Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) and a delayed altcoin season, particularly if BTC can make a clean break above the $108,500 resistance level. Bitcoin Price Breakout To Spark Next Bull Run The Bitcoin price is currently hovering below a critical resistance level at $108,500, and according to a crypto analyst known as \u2018BigMike7335\u2019 on the X social media platform, a clean breakout and flip of this level into support could ignite an explosive Wave 3 bull run. Based on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci Extension analysis, a successful move above this threshold could open the door to a bullish price surge with potential targets set in the $160,000 to $200,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Double Top Above $106,000: FVG Says A Large Crash Is Coming The analyst\u2019s chart shows that Bitcoin has already completed its Wave 1 of a five-wave impulse move, followed by an ABC corrective Wave 2. The market is also currently consolidating, and Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum appears to be rebuilding. These positive developments are supported by a rising Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the oversold region and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, both of which point toward upward price action. Notably, the 0.618 and 1.0 Fibonacci Extensions around $117,795 and $137,421, respectively, are highlighted as interim resistance zones where price momentum could temporarily slow before continuing upward. A clean breakout above $108,500 could also place Bitcoin above a heavy volume node visible in the volume profile within the chart, suggesting less overhead resistance and a stronger potential for a price rally. Furthermore, the analysis implies that during this powerful Wave 3 phase, Bitcoin Dominance will likely climb toward 70%. This increase in BTC.D would mean capital is concentrating in the leading cryptocurrency, which historically results in altcoins underperforming. As a result, the expected altcoin season for this cycle may be postponed, following the completion or cooling of Wave 3. Analyst Predicts $375,000 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak Crypto analyst TechDave has just sounded the alarm on what he calls the Bitcoin \u201claunch signal\u201d, a rare trigger that has only appeared four times in history and each time marked the start of major bull market rallies. This signal previously appeared in October 2012, July 2016, and July 2020\u2014all preceding major upward moves that ended in new cycle peaks. Related Reading: Fading Spot Volumes And Muted Futures Sentiment Threaten To Send Bitcoin Below $99,000 Again Currently, the same signal is emerging this July, aligning with the previous cycle structures and reinforcing the expectation of a breakout phase. Notably, the formation has led to exponential gains, with each bull market run typically peaking months later. Following this historical pattern, TechDave now predicts a fresh cycle top for Bitcoin at $375,000. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Shaun Donelly knows a hot item when he sees one \u2013 and Bitcoin\u2019s the hottest item of them all. The CEO of the Lingerie Fighting Championship plans to build the company\u2019s own Bitcoin treasury, and he\u2019s taking inspiration from an unlikely source: GameStop. Is this a flash in the pan, or is the Lingerie Fighting Championship onto something? And what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin treasuries \u2013 and for innovative applications of the blockchain? From GameStop, to Strategy, and Back Again Remember the glory days of GameStop stonks? Back when Robinhood, the trading platform, and GameStop were household names, at least for a certain sector of the trading populace. Since the heady days of $81.25 $GME stock, back in 2021, GameStop has largely trundled along, doing its own thing. Over the past year, it traded in a fairly narrow range, up a little under 5%. But GameStop did make a big splash a few weeks ago, when it announced that it was taking a step back from Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy approach, and would be amassing its own Bitcoin treasury. Ironically, back in 2020 and 2021, when $GME was soaring, Michael Saylor had already started to take the approach with (Micro)Strategy that would make him famous, purchasing Bitcoin early and often. And as Bitcoin\u2019s price rose, Strategy\u2019s strategy paid off. So when GameStop announced that it would follow in Saylor\u2019s footsteps, some heads turned. And without further ado, GameStop purchased 4,170 Bitcoin. GameStop Inspires LFC Back to Shaun Donelly. The LFC CEO watched GameStop make its big Bitcoin purchase and decided to follow suit. To that end, the LFC will purchase $230K of Bitcoin in the next month; they plan to spend up to $2M in the next six months. The move comes ahead of a series of first-ever UK shows, with key fighters in the LFC ready to take the stage. It\u2019s not a trendsetting move, but rather one that follows a Bitcoin treasury strategy that has been adopted by companies both large and small alike, and even by the US government itself. And there\u2019s every sign that GameStop isn\u2019t done \u2013 the company has $450M of a potential $2.25B ready to deploy to bolster its Bitcoin supply, according to a recent SEC filing. Donelly hopes that his company can tap into the same energy Strategy did, and maybe even a bit of the same profit over the next decade; since making its first Bitcoin purchase, $MSTR stock is up 3,170%. There\u2019s another project in the works that aims to take advantage of the healthy crypto climate. SUBBD Token aims to spice up the $85B content creation market with a combination of AI + blockchain. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) \u2013 Bringing Fans and Creators Together with $SUBBD The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is another red-hot commodity. The SUBBD platform unleashes AI content management and production, bringing both together in one place for the first time. Creators gain new ways to connect with their fans, who can use $SUBBD to access exclusive content and receive subscription discounts. At the same time, the $SUBBD platform offers several AI tools, including: \u2705 AI profile creation \u2705 AI voice notes \u2705 AI video generator \u2705 AI livestream The entire suite can be used to boost AI influencers and to manage content from human creators. And with $SUBBD, both fans and creators alike can token-gate exclusive content to create new and more personal ways of interacting. The SUBBD Token presale, now on, has raised over $714K so far. Tokens are priced at $0.0558. Our price prediction shows the token price could reach $0.438by by the end of 2025, returning 684% to current investors. Learn how to buy SUBBD Token with our guide. Visit the SUBBD Token presale to learn more. From SUBBD to the LFC From GameStop to MicroStrategy and now to the Lingerie Fighting Championship, the Bitcoin treasury strategy continues to ripple across unexpected sectors. Shaun Donelly\u2019s $2M commitment to BTC might seem unconventional, but it reflects a broader realization: Bitcoin \u2013 and crypto more broadly \u2013 is no longer fringe; it\u2019s foundational. Projects like SUBBD Token are capitalizing on blockchain\u2019s flexibility, merging AI, content creation, and fan engagement in powerful new ways. In the ring and online, the crypto fight is heating up. Remember to always do your own research; this isn\u2019t financial advice."
