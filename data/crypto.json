      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/can-bitcoin-bounce-to-120000/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price has continued to trade sideways since hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,900 earlier in May. Amid the current price action, crypto analyst Decode has provided insights into whether the leading crypto will rally to $120,000 or drop below $100,000 next. Analyst Reveals What&#8217;s Next For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Decode shared an accompanying chart in which he made an ABC wave analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, the leading crypto is expected to drop below $100,000 before it rallies to a new ATH of $120,000. The chart showed that BTC could fall to as low as $96,500 on the Wave B corrective move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next This drop to $96,500 is expected to happen this month. Once that is done, Decode predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally above $120,500 before the end of July. This will mark the Wave C impulsive move to the upside. This aligns with veteran trader Peter Brandt\u2019s prediction that BTC could reach as high as $150,000 by late summer. However, crypto analyst KillaXBT has predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit the $120,000 target by mid-June. This coincides with the June FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18. A Fed rate cut could serve as the catalyst for such a parabolic rally from the current BTC price level. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 97.4% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged. As such, market participants aren\u2019t expecting a rate cut, which is why the Bitcoin price could pump massively if Jerome Powell and the FOMC were to surprise everyone. Moreover, US President Donald Trump yesterday urged the Fed to cut rates by a full point. A Breakout Might Be On The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that a breakout could be imminent for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is progressing inside a 4-hour falling wedge, which indicates a bullish reversal pattern. If confirmed, the analyst stated that the breakout could target the $107,500 and $109,500 zones, which are the Fibonacci confluence areas. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the solid V-shape recovery for the Bitcoin price after the leading crypto dropped to as low as $100,000 on May 5. However, the analyst noted that BTC\u2019s rebound back to the $105,000 zone won\u2019t matter until it breaks above the $106,800 level. The leading crypto must also show actual follow-through with 3-day to 1-week closes to support a breakout. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,000.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-returns-to-100k-blockchain-firm/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price has not had quite the same spark it did at the beginning of the last month so far in June. The premier cryptocurrency has somewhat struggled to break out of a consolidation range since reaching a new all-time high in the month of May. The Bitcoin price recently succumbed to bearish pressure, falling to around $101,000 on Friday, June 6. While the market leader has enjoyed some resurgence to begin the weekend, a prominent blockchain firm has now identified significant levels in the event of a return to the $100,000 level in the coming days. Here Are The Next Support Levels For BTC In a June 6 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Sentora (previously known as IntoTheBlock) revealed an interesting on-chain perspective on the price of Bitcoin and its latest dip toward $100,000. According to the intelligence platform, there are some significant levels lying just beneath the six-figure valuation threshold. This analysis is based on the average cost basis of several Bitcoin investors and the distribution of the BTC supply around the current price. For context, cost-basis analysis basically evaluates the capacity of a price level to act as support or resistance, depending on the volume of crypto last acquired by investors at this level. As observed in the chart below, the size of the dots directly corresponds with the quantity of BTC purchased within each price bracket and the region\u2019s capacity to act as support or resistance. This implies that the larger the dot, the higher the number of coins purchased, and the stronger the support or resistance level; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots serve as resistance (as they are above the asset price). According to data by Sentora, the Bitcoin price seems to have major support within the $95,000 &#8211; $99.000 region due to heavy accumulation by investors. This price zone would serve as an on-chain cushion for the Bitcoin price, as investors with their cost bases around the level are likely to defend their positions by acquiring more coins if the price falls toward the $95,000 \u2013 $99,000 zone. Sentora mentioned that if the bulls do defend this support level, the Bitcoin price could be in for an extended rally. On the flip side, the on-chain firm asked investors to expect a surge in volatility if this support level fails to hold. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $104,400, reflecting an almost 3% increase in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "XRP is currently showing signs of vulnerability as its recent price action is becoming increasingly bearish. After attempting to reclaim upside momentum above $ 2.60 in May, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain this run, and its price action over the past few days has brought it close to losing the $2.10 price level. Notably, the price action has resulted in the formation of a head and shoulders pattern on the daily candlestick chart. This might be the final straw that finally sends the XRP price plummeting below $2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows XRP Breaks Head And Shoulders Neckline As identified by a crypto analyst on the social media platform X, XRP has now printed a classic head and shoulders formation, with clearly defined symmetry between the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. The head and shoulders formation began taking shape in late April, when the price climbed to $2.26 to become the left shoulder of the pattern. In early to mid-May, XRP surged above $2.60 to create the head of the formation and what appeared at the time to be a resumption of strong bullish momentum. The rally lost steam soon after reaching that May peak, and the price began to retreat once again. By June 3, XRP made another attempt to push higher, reaching $2.27 in what is the formation of the right shoulder. However, this push wasn&#8217;t enough, and the ensuing price action has seen sellers gradually fighting for control. The head and shoulders pattern, which is often associated with trend reversals, became more concerning once XRP broke below the neckline around the $2.18 level to reach as low as $2.07 on July 6. Interestingly, the breakdown below the neckline was accompanied by increased volume, which provided additional confirmation of the bearish signal. EMA Rejections For XRP: What&#8217;s Next? Now that XRP has broken beneath the neckline, the $2.18 to $2.20 zone is beginning to flip into a firm resistance barrier for any attempt at recovery. The daily candlestick chart shows XRP continuing to trade below both the 9-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, which currently stand at $2.1877 and $2.2649 respectively. Despite a modest recovery over the past 24 hours, XRP has repeatedly failed to break back above the 9-day EMA since the neckline breakdown, showing persistent weakness in the short-term structure. As long as XRP is trapped beneath the neckline and the EMA/SMA resistance cluster, the prevailing structure continues to favor a downward extension. Based on the head and shoulders setup, a measured move from the neckline breakdown projects a decline toward the $1.85 to $1.80 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market\u2014Data At the time of writing, XRP now finds itself trading at the neckline resistance again at $2.18 after a 2.6% increase in the past 24 hours from $2.13. However, the strength of this bounce is questionable, as it has occurred alongside a sharp 48.14% drop in trading volume. The next 24 hours will be important, as price behavior around the $2.18 to $2.20 range could determine whether XRP resumes its descent and break below $2.

      "summary": "Solana (SOL) is showing resilience amid broader market weakness, as volatility shakes crypto assets across the board. After a sharp retrace alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is stabilizing above key demand levels, sparking cautious optimism among investors. Many are eyeing this zone as a potential launchpad for the next leg up, especially as the market seeks to recover and regain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 \u2013 Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Despite recent uncertainty, sentiment around Solana remains constructive. Analysts point to strong structural support and a history of sharp rebounds from similar technical setups. Among them, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a key signal that has caught the attention of traders: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal for Solana on the daily timeframe. Historically, this signal has preceded notable price rallies, particularly when it aligns with strong support zones. With Solana holding firm and broader sentiment gradually improving, bulls are watching closely for a push into higher supply zones. If confirmed, a breakout from this range could send SOL toward new short-term highs. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Solana can sustain this momentum and lead the next altcoin rally. Solana Tests Support As TD Sequential Signals Rebound Solana is holding a critical support zone near $145 after shedding more than 20% of its value since late May. The correction has brought SOL into a key demand area, where bulls appear to be defending the level with strength. Despite attempts to reclaim $160, the altcoin has faced persistent resistance, with fading momentum and rising macro risks clouding short-term price action. Market-wide conditions haven\u2019t helped either. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have stalled below key resistance zones, failing to spark a broader rally in altcoins. This hesitation has intensified uncertainty, with some analysts calling for a deeper retracement in SOL if market leaders continue to slide. However, others remain optimistic that Solana could soon turn the tide. A key signal for Solana has emerged, with analyst Martinez reporting that the TD Sequential indicator printed a buy signal on the daily chart. Historically, this indicator has been a reliable precursor to significant local bottoms and bullish reversals, particularly when seen near strong support levels. With SOL recently experiencing a selloff and now stabilizing, this signal underscores the growing bullish potential. For now, Solana\u2019s ability to hold above $145 will be key. A bounce from this level, combined with improving sentiment across large-cap assets, could trigger a fresh push toward $160 and beyond. If confirmed, such a move would signal that SOL is regaining strength and ready to retest higher resistance levels in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop \u2013 Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally SOL Retests Support After Prolonged Correction Solana (SOL) is trading at $148.44 after attempting a modest rebound from its recent local low near $145. The daily chart shows that SOL has lost momentum since peaking above $180 in late May, marking a 20% correction. Price is now holding just above the 100-day moving average (144.68), a key technical level that previously acted as support during consolidation phases. The 50-day and 34-day moving averages are now trending downward, with the 50-day SMA around $159.33 and the 34-day EMA near $159.35 \u2014 both acting as dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA remains higher at $177.49, reinforcing the presence of a strong overhead supply zone between $160 and $180. Despite the bearish pressure, volume has remained relatively muted during the recent drop, suggesting that panic selling hasn\u2019t taken over yet. If SOL manages to hold above the $144\u2013$145 region, this could form the base for a rebound, especially if broader market sentiment improves. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup \u2013 Historic Run Incoming? A daily close back above the 34-EMA could open the door for a recovery toward $160.
