      "summary": "Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $13.36, following a 3% drop in the past 24 hours, which places the altcoin approximately 74% below its all-time high of $52.70, recorded in May. Despite this short-term dip, LINK has held onto weekly gains of around 2.4%, suggesting broader market participants may still be weighing its long-term potential. While price remains rangebound, recent on-chain data indicates that LINK\u2019s price action could be the result of diverging behavior between retail and institutional investors. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move Holds The Key Chainlink Institutional Accumulation and Supply Pressure CryptoQuant contributor \u201cBanker\u201d highlighted a growing structural dynamic in the LINK ecosystem in a recent QuickTake analysis titled \u201cLINK\u2019s Accumulation Standoff: Whales Build, Retail Waits.\u201d The report outlines how LINK is currently in a consolidation phase between $12 and $15, where institutional actors have been steadily accumulating tokens, while retail users remain largely passive. This discrepancy may be playing a key role in capping upward momentum despite persistent LINK outflows from centralized exchanges. According to Banker, exchange netflows for LINK have remained negative at roughly -100,000 LINK per week, signaling that more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This behavior is typically associated with accumulation activity, particularly from larger holders or \u201cwhales\u201d who may be positioning for longer-term appreciation. Historical spikes in retail deposits, such as the +5 million LINK deposited in March 2025, have proven to be exceptions rather than the norm, as retail activity has since remained subdued. Supporting this view, active LINK addresses have hovered consistently between 28,000 and 32,000 per day, while transaction counts average around 9,000 daily. These figures have not rebounded from previous activity peaks seen in late 2024, even as Chainlink\u2019s oracle usage has expanded. Meanwhile, elevated levels of exchange withdrawals, peaking at over 3,000 per day in Q4 2024, remain a dominant force. With leverage metrics staying neutral, whales have been able to withdraw LINK without introducing significant price volatility, resulting in a 40% year-to-date drop in exchange reserves. Market Outlook Hinges on Retail Reentry or Whale Fatigue As LINK\u2019s consolidation persists, the path forward may depend on a shift in market dynamics. Banker points out that a meaningful breakout will likely require renewed participation from retail traders, as evidenced by a spike in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals \u2018Opportunity\u2019 If these metrics rise and price breaks above the $15 price mark, momentum could build for a stronger upward trend. On the other hand, a decline in whale-driven withdrawals or an increase in exchange inflows could weaken accumulation, potentially pushing LINK back down toward the $10 level. Banker added: Until catalysts emerge, whales silently build positions, echoing Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 consolidation before its 2024 surge. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens\u2014Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What\u2019s Coming He points out that transactions on the XRP Ledger settle in 3\u20135 seconds and cost fractions of a penny. That beats SWIFT transfers, which can take days and cost up to $50 per payment. XRP still trades around $2,25 but that figure, he argues, won\u2019t stay low for long if the token keeps winning regulatory approvals and new partners. XRP is the most disruptive financial technology of our lifetime. Ripple isn\u2019t just competing with the banking system, it\u2019s replacing it. The old system is dead. The new financial rails are being laid right before your eyes. Stay asleep and you\u2019ll miss the greatest wealth transfer\u2026 \u2014 Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) July 2, 2025 Ripple\u2019s Technology Versus Legacy Rails Based on reports, RippleNet now counts more than 300 financial institutions in its network. Yet daily on\u2011chain volumes for XRP hover around $1 billion\u2014small next to global cross\u2011border flows of roughly $150 billion per day. Banks are testing the tech, but most haven\u2019t shifted large sums yet. That gap between tests and real\u2011world use is one reason XRP\u2019s price has stayed below its all\u2011time high for seven years. Push For Regulatory Clarity XRP backers are watching the US carefully. They see growing buzz around spot XRP ETFs. Analysts like Eric Balchunas have given those filings up to 95% odds of approval by year\u2011end. If an ETF hits a US exchange, they say, more money will pour in. Ripple has also been chasing money\u2011transmitter licenses in Europe and Asia. Every new license, they believe, brings Ripple a step closer to mainstream use. Community Calls For Patience Coach JV keeps telling followers not to panic over a stagnant price. He uses phrases like \u201cgreatest wealth transfer in history\u201d to drive home his point. In an earlier tweet, he promised \u201cunimaginable wealth\u201d for anyone who holds on. Other voices, such as commentator Edoardo Farina, point out that only about 1 to 2 million people hold XRP today. That number, they say, leaves room for 100 million or more newcomers\u2014and more buyers often means higher prices.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-targets-3000/",
      "summary": "The Ethereum price is flashing major upside signals as on-chain and market activity align toward a potential breakout to the $3,000 level. With crypto exchange balances falling to their lowest in nine years, stablecoin rails hitting record highs, and Spot Ethereum ETF inflows spiking last month, analysts now describe ETH as a \u201cpowder keg\u201d primed for explosive movement. Ethereum Price Eyes A $3,300 Breakout The Ethereum price action is drawing attention as it continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation range, hovering near $2,555 at the time of writing. Based on a recently released technical analysis by crypto analyst Pentoshi on X social media, ETH could be on the verge of a significant move, with $3,300 marked as the next bullish target in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here\u2019s Why The crypto expert\u2019s chart reveals that since early May 2025, Ethereum has been locked between two key levels\u2014a support zone around $2,190 and resistance near $2,750. This range has remained intact for over eight weeks, signaling a period of accumulation and low volatility after the sharp decline experienced in the first quarter of the year. Pentoshi has pinpointed $2,100 as the key downside risk in his bullish outlook, aligning closely with the lower support zone marked on the chart. While the next bullish extension and major resistance level has been identified as $3,300, the analyst expects Ethereum to make a move toward this price level within the next three months. He suggests that the current setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, estimating a potential upside of roughly 3.2x compared to the downside risk. Analyst Calls Ethereum A \u201cPowder Keg\u201d In other news, Eric Conner refers to Ethereum as a \u201cpowder keg,\u201d highlighting a growing convergence of fundamental factors that are building up pressure and positioning the cryptocurrency for a potentially parabolic move in the market. Related Reading: The Ethereum Waiting Game: Breakout To $2,800 Or Crash To $2,000? The analyst reports that Stablecoin activity on Ethereum has reached historic highs, with the total market capitalization of on-chain dollar-denominated assets hitting $251 billion\u2014a record that also marks 21 consecutive months of uninterrupted growth. In parallel, Ethereum Spot ETFs have brought in $1.17 billion in net inflows during June alone, marking a major shift in investors&#8217; appetite for ETH exposure. Even more notable, the amount of Ethereum available for trading is now at its lowest level in nearly a decade, with only nine million ETH tokens on centralized crypto exchanges. This nine-year low in exchange balances signals a drying float, where any fresh demand has an outsized impact on price. Conner has stated that large-scale crypto investors are beginning to take note. He reports that wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have accumulated more than 800,000 tokens daily during the peak week in June, marking the most aggressive absorption by whales since 2017. Currently, price action mirrors tension, and the analyst warns that if Ethereum decisively clears the $2,600 resistance level, the combination of supply scarcity, ETF-driven demand, and explosive stablecoin usage could unleash a violent and rapid breakout.

      "summary": "SUI is moving decisively on the chart, breaking through key levels with rising momentum, signaling a shift in sentiment and renewed bullish interest. With volume picking up and structure turning clean, SUI could be setting the stage for a move if this momentum holds. Immediate Targets In Sight \u2014 But Can SUI Push Further? In an X post, crypto expert and moderator, Tinkerbell, shared an update that SUI has broken decisively above the $3.00 mark, surging to $3.08 and notching a 9% gain on Thursday, July 3rd. The price action reflects a breakout on the chart, which shows strong momentum, is backed by rising volume and steady buying pressure, signaling that bulls are firmly in control. Related Reading: SUI Prepares For Bullish Flag Breakout Amid $3 Reclaim \u2013 Analyst Doubles The Target If this strength continues, Tinkerbell highlights the $3.25 as the next immediate target, followed by the $3.50 level, both levels could act as stepping stones for further upside. Another analyst, Professor, mentioned that SUI has come alive on the charts, and it&#8217;s pumping. With a sharp 11.08% gain in the past 24 hours, the token is currently trading at $3.02, marking one of the strongest day performances across the market. SUI broke through the key resistance level, a zone that had capped upside momentum for weeks. This breakout arrived quietly, with strong bullish momentum, increased volume, and a shift in sentiment that now favors the bulls. Professor also highlighted in another X post that a textbook bullish reversal for the SUI 1-hour chart. After finding strong support around $2.65, the price began forming a series of higher lows, signaling a clear shift in momentum. The structure, paired with rising volume, pointed to growing buyer confidence. This setup led to a breakout, with SUI blasting through short-term resistance at $2.90 and reaching as high as $3.04. This move established a new high, signaling the potential start of a sustained uptrend. Momentum Indicators Point To A Cautious Climb SUI shows a gradual uptrend on the daily chart, currently trading at $3.02. Cleanwater, a crypto analyst, pointed out that after touching lows near $2.50 in late June, the price has steadily climbed, forming a series of higher lows and attempting to establish a recovery pattern. Related Reading: Sui (SUI) Eyes Breakout With Bullish Dual Pattern: Is A Rally To $27 On? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 52.94, suggesting neutral momentum, placing SUI in the middle of the momentum range between overbought and oversold. Meanwhile, the MACD shows bullish divergence, indicating possible strength building on the surface that is not yet at the breakout levels. SUI key resistance is around $3.50, which will be a crucial level to clear if bulls want to sustain upward momentum. On the downside, $2,80 is a support zone that needs to hold for this recovery structure to remain intact. Market expert Trade4ddict also noted that SUI has confirmed an ascending triangle breakout on the 4-hour chart, showing a continuation of bullish momentum. After a brief retest, price action has turned green with trend bars painting a promising picture for the days ahead. The analyst stated that the chart looks very bullish, and he has entered a long position targeting the $3.74 level, which aligns with previous highs and offers a clean objective if this bullish wave continues.

      "title": "XRP Could Hit $9 In Euphoric Fifth Wave, Elliott Wave Analyst Predicts",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-could-hit-9-in-euphoric-fifth-wave/",
      "summary": "XRP is inching toward what could be its most consequential technical inflection in more than a year, according to the June 3 video analysis from the YouTube channel More Crypto Online (MCO). Employing classical Elliott-wave mapping, the analyst argues that XRP has been building a five-wave advance ever since the market reset in July 2023 and is now attempting to ignite the terminal \u201cfifth\u201d wave\u2014a rally that, if it unfolds under euphoric conditions, could extend as far as $9. How The Roadmap Is Built For XRP \u201cWe might be in a process of upside reversal\u2026 It\u2019s like a now-or-never moment,\u201d the commentator told viewers, stressing that breakouts are usually obvious only after large portions of the move are already spent. In Elliott wave terminology the market is said to be preparing for a smaller-degree third wave inside the larger fifth, \u201cnormally the most aggressive one,\u201d he noted, pointing to the explosive impulse that followed a similar set-up last year. Related Reading: Analyst: XRP Is Coiled For A Short Squeeze Rally On MCO\u2019s primary chart the July 2023 trough serves as the wave-four low of an even larger advance. From there, a series of lower-degree one-two formations appears to have carried XRP into wave three and, more recently, into a sideways, three-legged correction that completed in April. \u201cWe have a wave 1, a wave 2, a wave 3, the wave 4, and maybe this is now the fifth wave that\u2019s unfolding,\u201d he explained, adding that wave four\u2019s depth and duration were textbook for a counter-trend pause. To translate wave counts into price objectives the analyst measured waves 1 through 3 and projected the classic 61.8 percent Fibonacci extension from the bottom of wave 4. That calculation yields $6.20 as a \u201cstraightforward\u201d fifth-wave target. The same measurement\u2019s 78.6 percent extension sits at roughly $9.00, a level the commentator said \u201csometimes materialises in a very euphoric fifth wave.\u201d Before any discussion of $5-plus prices becomes actionable, XRP must clear a cluster of near-term hurdles. The analyst identifies the $2.30\u2013$2.40 range as the first structural ceiling; it coincides with a descending trend-line that has capped every rally since March and with the 100-day exponential moving average. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $50 If Ripple Gets Bank License, Claims Crypto Pundit The shorter-time-frame wave count shows why this band matters. From the 7 April swing low the market printed a clear five-wave micro-structure, implying that a fresh up-trend may already be underway. Yet, as the analyst cautioned, \u201cWe still have to clear all these previous swing highs\u2026 We\u2019ve got resistance in this area around $2.30, structurally $2.40.\u201d A decisive break above that shelf would validate a sub-wave (iii) target around $3.30\u2013$3.50, the January swing-high zone the video calls \u201cthe next level.\u201d Bearish Scenario For XRP Every Elliott-wave blueprint comes with an invalidation level. In the MCO model the entire fifth-wave scenario survives only if price holds above the April nadir\u2014the start of wave 1 in the current one-two set-up. At the micro level the bulls must also defend what the video labels \u201cthe $1.99 support area.\u201d A deeper retracement to $1.60 (the \u201cred dotted line\u201d) could be tolerated inside an extended wave 2, but any sustained trade beneath that mark would probably mean wave 4 is still developing, pushing back the timetable for a breakout. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re holding above the April low, this pathway higher remains valid and plausible,\u201d the analyst reiterated. Conversely, a failure there would force a re-evaluation of the entire count. Although the headline $9 print grabs attention, the analyst is clear that such an extension presupposes an extreme sentiment shift. Historically XRP\u2019s rallies have often stalled near the 61.8 percent projection, and the channel\u2019s host reminds viewers that \u201cmarket sentiment\u201d ultimately decides whether the 78.6 percent extension is reachable. For now the focus is squarely on securing an impulsive close above $2.40 and then on challenging the mid-$3 region. Only once that campaign succeeds will the discussion move seriously toward $5.65, $6.20 and, in a parabolic climax, the high-single-digit zone. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.
