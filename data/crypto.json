      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-as-polymarket-nears-1b-valuation-bitgo-hits-100b/",
      "summary": "In a sign of crypto\u2019s accelerating maturation, two major developments reinforce how institutional adoption and investor confidence are surging in tandem. BitGo, one of the largest crypto custodians, has seen its assets under custody balloon to $100B in 2025. Polymarket \u2013 a decentralized prediction market \u2013 is set to raise $200M at a $1B valuation, riding the wave of surging interest in crypto-native applications. The stories showcase how demand for both regulated, institutional-grade services and platforms is growing rapidly. Safety Plus Speculation BitGo\u2019s rise underscores the growing institutional hunger for secure, compliant infrastructure. The California-based firm now holds $100B in digital assets, a 66% increase from $60B at the start of the year. Much of that growth comes from increased demand for staking services (which now account for half of its holdings) and from a rising tide of institutional adoption. BitGo also expanded into South Korea in 2024 and Dubai in 2025, further building on an already powerful foundation in its aim to become more competitive in the industry. In contrast, Polymarket\u2019s trajectory highlights the viral growth of speculative, user-driven DeFi applications. The platform, known for letting users bet on everything from elections to sports outcomes, surged in popularity during the 2024 U.S. presidential cycle, processing over $3.3B in bets. Now, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund is reportedly leading a $200M funding round, positioning Polymarket to become a unicorn asset And this immediately after Polymarket announced a partnership with X. The timing is perfect: there&#8217;s a strong appetite for decentralized markets offering high-risk, high-reward plays. Confidence on Two Fronts These contrasting success stories reveal a broader truth: crypto is no longer a monolith. Institutional players are flocking to battle-tested custodians like BitGo, who offer the compliance and security infrastructure needed to satisfy regulators (so far, at least: BitGo remains banned in the US). Meanwhile, crypto-native projects like Polymarket are pulling a different kind of capital \u2013 Venture Capitals betting on engaging decentralized apps that leverage core blockchain values of trustless systems and open markets. Both Bitgo and Polymarket demonstrate the growing confidence in the crypto economy, and the potential lying in wait. Confidence from institutions, who now see crypto as a serious asset class, and from venture backers, who see new economic behaviors forming around blockchain-native markets. BitGo\u2019s next chapter could include a public listing by late 2025. And Polymarket is reportedly exploring a token launch \u2013 a move that could further incentivize users and decentralize governance. Interested in tapping into that same retail interest? Here are three of the best crypto to buy now. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) \u2013 Find and Snipe Best Solana Meme Coins Want to know a meme coin trading secret? Some of the best Solana meme coins never make it to major platforms. They trade \u2018underground,\u2019 on platforms like Telegram. Trading them isn\u2019t just about getting the right insider info; it\u2019s about finding them and executing razor-sharp, perfectly timed trades. That\u2019s precisely where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. It\u2019s the newest and best Solana meme crypto trading bot. Snorter provides a suite of advanced algorithmic trading tools, including automated sniping and fast swaps with built-in front-running protection. Snorter isn\u2019t just about being fast \u2013 it emphasizes staying safe as well, with honeypot detection and rugpull protection.

That\u2019s a bit unfair to the ecosystem itself, but presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors. In fact, over the past year $TRX has posted 123% gains. Those gains are fueled not only by $TRX, but by broader activity on the Tron network, including $USDT. The world\u2019s leading stablecoin ($156B market cap) is heavily traded on Tron. The demand led to a recent minting of another $2B on the network. With stablecoins increasingly in the public eye \u2013 see the recent GENIUS Act \u2013 that demand is likely to only increase. BitGo and Polymarket Demonstrate Bullish Market Corporate success with BitGo and Polymarket shows just how broad the interest in crypto actually is \u2013 from retail investors to venture capitalists. And it makes these tokens some of the best crypto to buy right now. As always, do your own research \u2013 this isn\u2019t financial advice."

      "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill Tuesday left risk-asset traders with a single, binary question: does the most interest-sensitive summer in years end with a crypto breakout or a macro-driven crash? In a prepared statement, Powell stressed that \u201cinflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated,\u201d adding that the Federal Open Market Committee is \u201cwell-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\u201d Crypto\u2019s Fate May Be Sealed In July For crypto markets already oscillating on every nuance of policy guidance, the message was clear: the next four weeks\u2014anchored by the 12 July CPI release and the 19 July payrolls report\u2014will decide whether July\u2019s FOMC delivers relief or a reality check. POWELL: WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MEANINGFUL TARIFF INFLATION EFFECTS JUNE, JULY AUGUST POWELL: IF WE DON&#8217;T SEE THAT, THAT WOULD LEAD TO CUTTING EARLIER \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) June 24, 2025 Powell\u2019s caution sits atop a rare public split inside the Board itself. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both Trump appointees, have openly argued that tariff-related price spikes are likely to be \u201cone-time shifts\u201d and therefore should not stand in the way of an early cut\u2014potentially as soon as the 30 July meeting. Seven of their colleagues disagree, laying out projections that keep policy unchanged through December. Powell, for his part, told lawmakers: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be in any rush, because the economy is still strong.\u201d Related Reading: Crypto Bull Run Over? Here\u2019s What A Top Trader Just Said Markets reacted by flattening the front end of the curve. Two-year Treasury yields fell to 3.806 percent, while the benchmark 10-year dipped to 4.285 percent\u2014both lows not seen since early May\u2014after the testimony and a surprise cease-fire in the Middle East turbo-charged a global \u201crisk-on\u201d bid. Yet expectations for July remain finely balanced: CME FedWatch shows that traders have whittled the probability of a first 25-basis-point cut to roughly 19%. Crypto traded the cross-currents rather than the headline. Bitcoin, which had cratered to $99,000 on Monday, reclaimed $106,000 by Wednesday morning, mirroring the rebound in equities and high-beta currencies as the dollar slumped on falling yields. Ethereum, meanwhile, held above $2,400\u2014even as Powell\u2019s tone was widely described as hawkish. The broader crypto complex moved in sympathy, with BNB punching through $644 and Solana stabilising near $146. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant Veteran traders on X distilled the stakes. Pseudonymous analyst Byzantine General wrote, \u201cWe got a lot of clarity now. All eyes on the July CPI print.\u201d Nic from CoinBureau added that July \u201cis in play\u2014maybe\u2014but nothing\u2019s locked in,\u201d as Powell\u2019s testimony brought no big surprises. Meanwhile, Jim Bianco commented: \u201cTrump appointees Waller and Bowman are suggesting a July cut. Powell is reiterating \u2018no.\u2019 Will the July FOMC meeting see at least two dissenters?\u201d For now, Powell\u2019s \u201cwatch and wait\u201d stance has bought the FOMC four more weeks of optionality. If July inflation confirms the down-trend, the policy door swings open, and the next rally for crypto could morph into a full-blown melt-up. If it doesn\u2019t, the crash could come just as fast. As Byzantine General put it, the market \u201cgot clarity.\u201d What it did not get is comfort. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,892.

      "summary": "Trump Media and Technology Group Corp (TMTG) has officially filed for its second crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF), focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as detailed in a recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump Media Files For Second Crypto ETF If the SEC approves this new investment product, it will trade on NYSE Arca, the electronic division of the New York Stock Exchange known for handling exchange-traded fund transactions. This latest filing comes just eight days after TMTG submitted a prospectus with the Connecticut Attorney General through its Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) partner, Yorkville America. Majority-owned by President Donald Trump, Trump Media is intensifying its efforts to promote financial products linked to blockchain technologies. The company aims to provide the public with regulated investment vehicles that offer exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of 2021? Here\u2019s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow Recently, Trump Media announced its ambition to raise $2.4 billion, with the goal of becoming one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. This move appears to be part of a broader strategy to diversify its business and attract a wider array of investors. By launching multiple crypto-focused ETFs, Trump Media hopes to generate significant interest in its stock, potentially positioning itself as an appealing option for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, with several crypto ETFs already available in the market, there are questions about how much investor interest these funds will garner. The success of the ETFs will likely hinge on their fee structures and how competitive they are compared to existing options. Bitcoin To Hit $180,000-$250,000 As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $106,000, recovering 3% from a recent drop to $98,000. This volatility is largely attributed to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, which has intensified over the past 12 days, impacting financial markets significantly. Market analyst known as Mr. Wall Street recently shared his insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), reiterating his bullish targets for Bitcoin, which he believes will reach between $180,000 and $250,000 this year despite any external conflict. Interestingly, Mr. Wall Street noted a significant shift in capital flows, with over $20 billion moving from gold to Bitcoin in the last two weeks alone. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month This trend suggests that institutional investors and hedge funds are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a more reliable store of value compared to gold, given Bitcoin&#8217;s fixed supply. Additionally, Mr. Wall Street pointed out that the over-the-counter (OTC) desks are becoming less liquid, indicating that significant upward movement in Bitcoin&#8217;s price could be imminent. A key indicator, the hash ribbon, recently flashed, signaling that Bitcoin often experiences a 10% correction before rallying by 50-125%. Mr. Wall Street believes that the recent dip to $98,000 constituted this correction, and he anticipates a substantial return on investment from current levels. Moving forward, the analyst expects \u201ccontinued noise\u201d from the geopolitical landscape, but he believes that further escalation is unlikely. The recent market dip created a sense of peak fear, which historically precedes significant price breakouts, Mr. Wall Street said. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

Since then, DOGE has bounced about 6\u20137%, but the real test lies ahead. Kevin noted that this level has acted as structural support since the end of the 2022\u20132023 bear market. The macro 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, drawn from Dogecoin\u2019s full bull run top to its bear market bottom, aligns with long-standing trendlines and a weekly demand candle. \u201cThis is your zone,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cMark this off on your charts.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target Yet despite the recent bounce, Dogecoin remains beneath all its major daily and 4-hour moving averages. The next critical resistance stands at $0.19. \u201cIf you can reclaim $0.19 on Dogecoin, you then break back into this range\u2014the $0.19 to $0.26 range,\u201d Kevin explained, calling it the key to any continuation higher. Until then, he cautions against assuming a full reversal is underway: \u201cLet\u2019s not get too crazy here\u2026 still a lot of work to do.\u201d The RSI also tells a story. Kevin pointed out that Dogecoin\u2019s weekly RSI has repeatedly bounced off the 38 level throughout the current bull cycle. The coin now hovers just above that zone once again. \u201cAnything below 38 on this weekly RSI is going to be a breakdown of that $0.143 to $0.127 range, which would be very, very sketchy at that point,\u201d he warned. Momentum indicators on multiple time frames are sending mixed signals. The daily chart is flashing oversold conditions, and Kevin\u2019s custom indicator lit up with a buy signal. On the 3-day timeframe, market cipher\u2019s momentum wave is \u201ckind of trying to clip\u201d upward, while money flow is beginning to tick slightly higher. \u201cThat three-day candle was very nice,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind you want to see\u2014strong demand candles at major support.\u201d Related Reading: Dogecoin About To Explode? \u2018Don\u2019t Send It Too Hard,\u2019 Analyst Warns Still, Kevin urged caution. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work out and we start to head lower, the daily time frame doesn\u2019t produce the buy signal, doesn\u2019t produce much upside, we start to roll over\u2014then you know your Dogecoin support.\u201d DOGE/BTC Remains The Focus On the DOGE/BTC pair, Kevin noted that Dogecoin has returned to an \u201corange zone\u201d he previously highlighted as critical support. The strength of that zone may determine whether DOGE can hold relative strength against Bitcoin\u2014or continue to bleed lower as BTC dominance increases. \u201cDoge will follow Bitcoin at the end of the day,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cAnyone not doing their Dogecoin analysis in tandem with Bitcoin and USDT dominance\u2014be suspect of that analysis.\u201d Kevin concluded with a warning rooted in experience. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this game a long time. The first move out of these patterns\u2026 sometimes it\u2019s the wrong move. It traps people.\u201d While a reversal may be underway, confirmation is everything\u2014and the climb above $0.19 remains the gatekeeper. For now, Dogecoin teeters on the edge. The signals are there\u2014but so is the risk. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.166. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"
