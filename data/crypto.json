      "summary": "Bitcoin has been showing notable correlation to the stock equities recently, but data shows Ethereum is charting a more independent path. Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Showing Different Degrees Of Correlation To Other Assets In a post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) has talked about how the latest Correlation Matrix has looked between the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and traditional markets. The &#8220;Correlation Matrix&#8221; here refers to an indicator that tells us how closely tied together the prices of two given assets currently are. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the assets are reacting to moves in each other by moving in the same direction to some degree. The closer the metric is to 1, the stronger the relationship. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies there is a negative correlation between the two prices. That is, they are moving in opposite directions. For this side of the scale, the extreme point is -1. Naturally, the Correlation Matrix showing a value exactly equal to zero suggests there is no correlation whatsoever between the assets. In statistics, the two variables are said to be &#8216;independent&#8217; in this case. Now, here is the table shared by Sentora that shows how the Correlation Matrix of Bitcoin and Ethereum stands with respect to some traditional markets: As is visible above, the index that Bitcoin and Ethereum have the strongest positive correlation to is DAX. That said, the Correlation Matrix stands at 0.46 for ETH, meaning that while some correlation does exist, it&#8217;s not too intense. This isn&#8217;t the case for Bitcoin, which has the indicator sitting at 0.85, indicating its price is pretty in tandem with DAX. Likewise, BTC has a notable correlation to other stock market indices, with a metric value of 0.7, 0.68, and 0.69 for the Russel 2000, S&#38;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively. In contrast, Ethereum is almost fully independent from these indices, with the indicator standing quite close to zero for each of them. For US Dollar Index and VIX Index, the last two markets listed in the table, the Correlation Matrix is inside the negative zone for Bitcoin. This means that the digital asset has actively been moving against these indices.

Just like with the stocks, Ethereum is displaying little correlation to DXY and VIX, further reinforcing that the cryptocurrency has been following a trajectory of its own recently. BTC Price Bitcoin is mounting another bullish push as its price surges to $109,400, but it remains to be seen whether its fate will be any different from the weekend move.

      "summary": "On Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a remarkable all-time high (ATH) of $112,022, breaking free from its previous consolidation phase and lower resistance levels. Bitcoin Rally Faces Critical Test John Glover, the chief investment officer at crypto lending platform Ledn and a former managing director at Barclays Investment Bank, noted that the recent rally appears to be a retest of the previous all-time high set on May 22, which encountered selling pressure. As some investors opted to take profits, notable publicly traded companies, including Trump Media &#38; Technology Group and GameStop, have announced their intentions to purchase Bitcoin to bolster their treasuries. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% \u201cMoonshot\u201d For XRP Price If This Line Breaks Glover emphasized that the competition among these companies to accumulate Bitcoin could significantly impact market dynamics, given that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s popularity among publicly traded companies appears to be growing. However, the sustainability of Bitcoin&#8217;s rally largely hinges on macroeconomic conditions and developments in trade negotiations. Sid Powell, CEO of crypto asset-management firm Maple, highlighted that any setbacks in trade discussions before President Donald Trump\u2019s August 1 deadline could pose challenges for Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement. Conversely, if trade negotiations progress and inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve (Fed) might consider cutting interest rates, which could further support Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory. Scenarios For A Potential Breakout Toward $130,000 Market expert Doctor Profit recently took to social media, declaring that Bitcoin&#8217;s rally is just beginning. He confidently stated, &#8220;THE PARTY IS NOT OVER YET,&#8221; predicting a potential new all-time high soon. His analysis indicates a target range of $120,000 to $130,000 for this cycle. According to Doctor Profit, two potential scenarios could pave the way for this breakout. The first involves Bitcoin reaching the $113,000 to $114,000 range, followed by a correction to the $92,000 to $93,000 level, which aligns with a major liquidity pool and the CME gap. A rebound from this lower range could set the stage for a rapid ascent toward the $120,000 mark. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP\u2019s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated The second, more aggressive scenario suggests that Bitcoin could break through the $113,000 to $114,000 barrier and continue its upward momentum without revisiting lower liquidity levels. In either case, the $113,000 to $114,000 range is critical, as the market&#8217;s reaction to this level will significantly influence the speed and direction of Bitcoin&#8217;s next leg. When writing, BTC has retraced back toward $111,422, attempting to make this level its new support floor for further price appreciation. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-drop-below-107000/",
      "summary": "A new analysis shows that Bitcoin (BTC) may be on the verge of a calculated price crash that could take it below $107,000 before igniting the next bullish rally. The cryptocurrency market structure currently reflects a short-term bearish correction within a broader bullish trend, supporting the likelihood of a potential surge to new all-time highs soon. Bitcoin Prepares For Final Dip Below $107,000 Crypto market expert, Tehi Thomas, in a recent TradingView post, suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s current structure may be entering its final corrective phase. The analyst points to a potential price crash below the $107,000 level as part of a strategic play by smart money. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here\u2019s The Target The analyst shared a chart showing Bitcoin forming consecutive lower highs while its price presses downwards. Across these highs, the market is also respecting a descending trendline, a pattern which often indicates short-term bearish pressure. Notably, this trendline appears to be serving as a potential trap designed to engineer a liquidity grab and discount entry. Thomas notes that once the key zone and sell-side liquidity area around $107,800 is taken, Bitcoin\u2019s price is expected to dip into a nearby Fair Value Gap (FVG), extending down to the $106,500-$106,200 region. This FVG overlaps with critical Fibonacci levels, particularly the 0.786 retracement near $106,200, strengthening the confluence for a potential reversal point. Thomas has highlighted this $106,200 level as a high-probability buy zone, where institutions may re-enter the market. Notably, the analyst\u2019s anticipated price correction for Bitcoin is not seen as a breakdown of structure or market failure, but rather a calculated liquidity grab to fill inefficiencies left from the previous lag. As long as the price respects the $106,000 range and displays bullish order flow afterward, its projected correction is expected to complete the accumulation phase. All-Time Highs In Sight After Key Reversal Following Bitcoin\u2019s projected sweep and fill of the FVG, the cryptocurrency is expected to form a reversal structure that could kick off the next major rally. Despite the projected crash below $107,000, Thomas asserts that Bitcoin\u2019s overall macro trend remains bullish. Moreover, this short-term pullback is considered a setup for a much larger move toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Thomas\u2019s chart marks the $110,500 zone as the final magnet and ATH target, with a significant layer of untapped liquidity above it. The analyst\u2019s thesis is that once the sell-side pressure is exhausted and displacement confirms the shift in direction, Bitcoin could once again regain bullish momentum. Furthermore, the TradingView expert has pointed out that the FVG near $106,200 acts as both a liquidity magnet and a springboard, set to launch the flagship cryptocurrency into price discovery mode once again. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $108,744, meaning a potential surge to the projected ATH level at $110,500 will represent a 1.61% increase. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "title": "Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It\u2019s No Meme",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-to-3-94-this-cycle/",
      "summary": "In a monthly chart shared on July 8, crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) outlined a long-term bullish thesis for Dogecoin (DOGE), identifying a clear historical pattern that may signal the next major leg in its price trajectory. The focal point of the chart is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension\u2014used as a key projection level\u2014which Kevin implies is Dogecoin\u2019s next major upside target. Based on the chart, this level corresponds to $3.94. History Says Dogecoin Will Hit $3.94 Dogecoin\u2019s price action has followed a remarkably consistent macro-pattern across three major market phases. In each, DOGE formed a clear descending wedge, followed by an impulsive breakout and parabolic rally. These structures are annotated in yellow on the chart and preceded both the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. The most recent wedge breakout completed in November last year, with a retest of the breakout currently taking place. Kevin marks two historical Fibonacci extension levels that were reached following previous consolidations. Both peaked near the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of their respective bases\u2014a common target for extended bullish moves in technical analysis. For the current structure, this places DOGE\u2019s long-term Fibonacci target near $3.94, which would represent a roughly 2,218% move from the current price around $0.17. Related Reading: Chartist Slams Misleading Dogecoin Analysis: \u2018Focus On This Instead\u2019 Indicators further support the notion of a long-term base having formed. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the monthly chart has just reclaimed the neutral 50 zone, currently sitting at 50.39, a signal often interpreted as the transition from bearish to bullish control. In prior cycle, the monthly RSI always topped above 90. Notably, the monthly RSI is also in an uptrend since mid-2022, respecting the yellow trendline drawn by the analyst. A significant confluence comes from the Stochastic RSI, which has just completed a bottoming crossover in the oversold region. The last time this occurred, in early 2020, Dogecoin followed with a parabolic surge. This same dynamic now appears to be setting up again, echoing the previous cycle. Also noteworthy is the chart\u2019s structural emphasis on 0.382 Fibonacci retracement support, currently plotted at $0.13778, from which Dogecoin appears to be bouncing. This aligns with the green supertrend support, suggesting a critical local floor has been found. Related Reading: The $1 Dogecoin Dream Is Alive: Chartist Lays Out Parabolic Scenario While the purple zones on the chart above $0.50 are not formal price targets, Kevin clarified in a response to a community member that they are key resistance zones\u2014intermediary checkpoints before DOGE can make a full move toward its final Fibonacci extension. These zones span from approximately $1.00 to $1.20 as well as from $2.30 to $2.50, and eventually up toward the $3.94 range. Kevin emphasized that \u201cas well as Dogecoin has done this cycle especially compared to other altcoins, it still has not even come close to what it is capable of. That will change in the right environment.\u201d He further noted that Dogecoin has already seen a 10x move from its bear market low to the local highs, but believes \u201cthere\u2019s still work to do\u201d when the cycle of quantitative tightening by the US Federal Reserve ends. The chart and commentary triggered a strong community reaction. Users like @MonetaryRegimee declared \u201cWe always hit the 1.618,\u201d to which Kevin replied, \u201cTypically yes,\u201d reinforcing his confidence in the fractal repetition. Others described the current price action as \u201cthe calm before the storm.\u201d Whether Dogecoin ultimately fulfills its fractal-driven destiny toward $3.94 remains to be seen. But the historical technical symmetry laid out by Kevin\u2019s chart offers a compelling case that DOGE\u2019s long-term rally may be far from over. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.174.

Some market observers say that some parts of the ecosystem saw 10\u201350 % jumps in TVL, with a few protocols posting even bigger gains. This buzz comes at a time when many DeFi projects are struggling to grow. Japan Approval Draws Investors Based on reports, a key boost arrived when Sei earned approval from the Japan Financial Services Agency. That nod gives it a regulated path into one of the world\u2019s strictest crypto markets. Artemis Analytics noted that daily active addresses hit a two\u2011year high right after the JFSA greenlight.

Even with that jump, the coin still sits about 78 % below its March 2024 peak, trading around $0.26 today. Some technical analysts point to a chart floor at $0.25. A breach there could push SEI closer to $0.20, which would put pressure on holders who bought in at higher levels. Related Reading: 2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands \u2014 But Who Is He?

Over the last 30 days, SEI logged 17/30 (57%) green days and saw 19% price swings in that window. These figures suggest that short\u2011term dips could be sharp, but buyers may view lower prices as a chance to get in. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
