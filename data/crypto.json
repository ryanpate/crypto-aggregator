      "summary": "Institutional demand for Ethereum appears strong as spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded seventh-straight week of inflows. US Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Recently Seen Continuous Inflows In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the netflow related to the US Ethereum spot ETFs is looking. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to a given cryptocurrency without having to directly own tokens of it. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk? If $2,200 Cracks, $1,160 May Be Coming These ETFs trade on traditional platforms, so traders taking this route don&#8217;t have to bother with digital asset exchanges and wallets. For investors only familiar with the traditional mode, this fact can make the ETFs the preferrable mode of investment. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot ETFs for Ethereum in mid 2024, half a year after Bitcoin&#8217;s approval went through near the start of the year. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows how the aggregate netflow has been like for the US ETH spot ETFs during the past few months. As is visible in the graph, the Ethereum spot ETFs saw outflows earlier in the year, but the trend has been different since the final third of April. Save for a week in May, a net amount of capital has been pouring into these investment vehicles. &#8220;As ETH rebounded from $2.2K to $2.5K, institutional appetite followed,&#8221; notes Glassnode. &#8220;Spot ETH ETFs recorded 106K ETH in net inflows last week &#8211; marking the 7th consecutive week of positive flows.&#8221; Ethereum isn&#8217;t the only cryptocurrency that has recently been enjoying ETF inflows. As the analytics firm has pointed out in another X post, the number one digital asset, Bitcoin, is also seeing demand pick up. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin has also been seeing a green netflow for the US spot ETFs, but due to a week of outflows in early June, the streak only stands at three weeks for the asset. During the latest week, around 15,000 BTC flowed into the ETFs. In USD terms, that&#8217;s equivalent to $1.6 billion. For comparison, inflows amounted to $258.6 million for Ethereum. Clearly, while both have seen demand, there is a clear difference of scale involved between the two. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit From the graph, it&#8217;s apparent that the US Bitcoin spot ETFs saw an acceleration of demand over the course of June. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the trend would keep up in this month of July. ETH Price Ethereum crossed the $2,500 level earlier, but it seems the coin has since faced a pullback as its price is back at $2,400.

The sleeping giant is about to wake up! pic.twitter.com/1Pq6L0g5hH \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 28, 2025 Rising Hoards Signal Confidence The pace of ETH going into cold wallets has shot up sharply over the past few months. It\u2019s a bigger build\u2011up than in past cycles. If history is any guide, that sort of move usually precedes a price surge. Long\u2011term holders often buy early and hold tight before a big run. This kind of confidence from big players can spark wider interest. Network Traffic Hits Peak Based on reports, daily transactions on Ethereum just topped 1,500,000. That\u2019s the most since early 2023. A rise in on\u2011chain transfers often points to more users, more apps and more trading. When people send coins or use smart contracts, they fuel network fees and show real demand. High activity can pull in more traders looking to catch the next wave. Technical Barriers Remain ETH is trading near $2,460 and it hasn\u2019t cleared two key hurdles yet. The 50\u2011day moving average sits just above price, as does the 200\u2011day line. Those are tough barriers for any asset. Momentum tools aren\u2019t screaming \u201cbuy\u201d yet, either. The RSI sits around 49 and the MACD has flattened out after a stretch of weak readings. On\u2011balance volume is low, which means big buyers are still cautious. Related Reading: Crypto Bombshell: Developer Claims XRP Could Hit $20,000 What Comes Next For ETH? Even with strong on\u2011chain signs, price needs to break past $2,600 before bulls can charge ahead. If Ethereum can push through that level, the road to $3,000 would look clear. Traders will watch for volume spikes and a steady move above those moving averages. If it fails, the big holders could be stuck on the sidelines, holding bags that lose value.

      "summary": "Bitcoin remains within a relatively tight range, struggling to gain sufficient momentum to break the $110,000 mark. At the time of writing, the leading crypto by market cap trades at $106,437, down 1.1% over the past 24 hours and nearly 4.8% below its May all-time high. The current consolidation range between $105,000 and $107,000 has prompted close monitoring of market behavior, especially from whales and long-term holders (LTHs), as the market attempts to find its next direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near Bitcoin Whales Lead Market Activity as Profit Realization Surges Recent data from CryptoQuant suggests that a significant shift in realized profits on Binance may be influencing short-term price trends. CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk highlighted a major event on June 16, when over $2.6 billion in profits were realized on Binance alone, the second-largest spike of its kind on the platform. This activity was followed by immediate selling pressure and market reaction, suggesting that profit-taking from large investors remains a core factor in the current price movement. According to Crazzyblockk, the June 16 event saw a total of $4.5 billion in realized profits across centralized exchanges, with Binance accounting for nearly 58% of that volume. \u201cThis milestone is more than just a data point \u2014 it\u2019s a reminder of Binance&#8217;s unmatched influence on global crypto markets,\u201d the analyst wrote. He emphasized Binance\u2019s role in price discovery and how whale behavior on the platform often serves as a proxy for broader market sentiment. As institutional participants and high-net-worth investors execute large moves on Binance, their actions can foreshadow phases of trend reversals or sustained accumulation. The data also shows the importance of tracking realized profit and loss (PnL) metrics, especially on high-volume exchanges. The event reflects what Crazzyblockk described as \u201cstrategic profit-taking by sophisticated participants,\u201d many of whom rely on Binance&#8217;s infrastructure for executing high-liquidity trades. Long-Term Holder Selling Seen as Constructive Rotation In a separate QuickTake post, CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei Dent offered a different perspective by analyzing long-term holder activity. Dent observed that although Bitcoin has been trading sideways between $100,000 and $110,000 since May, on-chain indicators such as Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) and Binary CDD show persistent selling from long-term holders. These are entities that have held their coins for more than six months, indicating a redistribution of supply. However, Dent argues that this selling may not imply weakness. \u201cDespite this steady LTH selling, the price hasn&#8217;t broken down. This means the market is absorbing the sell pressure\u2014implying new demand is coming in,\u201d he explained. According to Dent, this dynamic, a rotation from older holders to new buyers, is common during mid-to-late stages of a bull market. Related Reading: Warning Signs? Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Take Profits as Leverage Spikes He also noted increased activity from coins held for one to three years, possibly reflecting profit-taking from previous cycle participants. Ultimately, Dent suggested the market may be undergoing a quiet redistribution, a phase that could lay the groundwork for future upside if buy-side demand remains strong.
