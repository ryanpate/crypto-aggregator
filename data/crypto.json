      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-breaks-symmetrical-triangle-next-stop-164/",
      "summary": "Solana has shown a potential breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle. Here&#8217;s where the next price target could lie, according to an analyst. Solana Has Surged Above Symmetrical Triangle Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Solana has just broken a resistance line. The level in question is part of a Symmetrical Triangle, a pattern from technical analysis (TA). This pattern belongs to the class of triangles, formations that involve the asset trading within two converging trendlines. The upper line acts as a source of resistance, while the lower one as that of support. A break out of either of these levels implies a continuation of trend in that direction. A surge above the triangle is a bullish sign and a drop under it a bearish one. Since the price&#8217;s range becomes narrower as it travels within a triangle, a breakout can become more likely as it approaches the apex. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype\u2014$4.4B Inflows Back The Move Generally, triangle breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the height of the formation (that is, the distance between the upper and lower trendlines at their widest). There are three popular triangle types: Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical. The first and second variants have one trendline parallel to the time-axis. In the case of the Ascending type, it&#8217;s the upper level. This means that as Solana moves inside an Ascending Triangle, its range gets narrower toward a net upside. Similarly, the Descending Triangle involves the opposite setup, with the support line being parallel to the time-axis instead. The third type, the Symmetrical Triangle, is the middle ground between the two: it has the two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In other words, the Symmetrical Triangle represents a period of consolidation where the range gets narrower in true sideways fashion. Due to this fact, a breakout is more-or-less equally probable to occur in either direction. In contrast, there is a bias associated in Ascending and Descending Triangles. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle Solana was trading inside just earlier: As is visible in the above graph, the Solana price was nearing in on the end of the triangle and as probability would dictate, a breakout was becoming likely. The asset indeed ended up finding a break and it seems to have been in the up direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum\u2019s Correlation Is Fading So what could be next for SOL? According to the analyst, the asset might target $164. This level corresponds to the 1.272 Fibonacci Extension line. Fibonacci Extension levels are defined based on ratios found in the popular Fibonacci series. The 1.272 level, in particular, corresponds to the square root of 1.618, which is the famous &#8216;Golden Ratio.&#8217; SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $158, up 3% in the last 24 hours.

The next major support is near the $0.1820 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1660 swing low to the $0.1992 high. The main support sits at $0.1780.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pump-fun-token-surges-in-pre-market-but-whales-are-shorting-it-why/",
      "summary": "As the official public sale of Pump.fun\u2019s token approaches, significant activity has emerged across decentralized derivatives exchanges, where large investors appear to be managing risk by taking early positions. Market data shows that whales are interacting with pre-market perpetual contracts, particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid and Binance, as they anticipate potential volatility during the token\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO), scheduled for July 12. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds \u2013 Details Perpetual Market Signals Whale Hedging Strategy Three prominent wallets have collectively deposited over $11 million in USDC on Hyperliquid to open short positions on the newly listed PUMP perpetual contract. These trades appear to function as hedges against anticipated allocations in the upcoming token generation event. According to on-chain tracker Lookonchain and explorer Hypurrscan, the structure of these positions, utilizing low leverage and modest open interest compared to margin collateral, suggests a defensive rather than speculative stance. One wallet, identified as \u201c0xAc72,\u201d allocated $4 million in margin and opened a 2x leveraged short valued at approximately $1.07 million at an entry price of $0.00504. This trader\u2019s liquidation point sits at $0.02138, offering a wide buffer that implies the position is less about profit from a downturn and more about offsetting potential downside risk from PUMP exposure in the ICO. Two additional wallets deployed a combined $7 million in margin to open 1x leveraged shorts. Together, these positions amount to roughly $2.39 million in open interest, a small portion of their posted collateral. Hyperliquid\u2019s open interest in PUMP has surpassed $43 million since listing the token in the early hours of Thursday\u2019s European session. Binance followed suit by listing a PUMP perpetual contract, which quickly amassed over $12 billion in trading volume, indicating heightened market anticipation. It is worth noting that the early trading could serve multiple purposes, including valuation locking by whales, arbitrage strategies related to expected airdrops, or speculative profit-taking based on retail momentum. Pump.fun Token Launch Nears as Pricing Premium Narrows The PUMP token initially debuted in pre-market trading at a roughly 40% premium to its ICO price of $0.004. It reached a high of $0.0056 on Hyperliquid before retreating to around $0.0047 levels, a level closer to its public sale valuation. The narrowing premium suggests a recalibration in investor expectations as trading stabilizes ahead of the launch. Pump.fun, a meme-coin launchpad built on Solana, announced the token in June alongside a revenue-sharing initiative for token holders. The token has a total supply of 1 trillion, with 33% allocated to early participants via a private sale (18%) and public sale (15%). The ICO will run from July 12 to July 15 on crypto exchange Bybit, providing a limited window for broader participation.
