      "summary": "Bitcoin is undergoing a slight retrace after hitting a new all-time high of $123,000 on Monday. While the broader trend remains bullish, short-term sentiment has shifted as selling pressure begins to build. Bulls are now defending key support levels, with the $117,000 zone emerging as a critical line that could determine whether the uptrend holds or deeper corrections follow. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Locked Hits New ATH: Smart Money Bets On Long-Term Growth The pullback has introduced fresh uncertainty into the market. According to new data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin Futures Position Dominance has started to lean bearish, suggesting that short positions are gaining momentum across major derivatives platforms. This shift reflects growing caution among traders, particularly as long-to-short ratios weaken and funding rates normalize after weeks of elevated bullish activity. Although Bitcoin remains far above its 2024 highs and the macro structure still favors bulls, the current pause is being closely watched. Investors are looking for confirmation that the recent all-time high was not a local top. With fear slowly creeping in and derivatives data flashing early warning signs, the coming days could be pivotal. Whether bulls can hold the line\u2014or whether bears take control\u2014will likely set the tone for Bitcoin\u2019s next major move. Bitcoin Retraces As Bearish Sentiment Rises Bitcoin has pulled back more than 5% since reaching its all-time high of $123,000 earlier this week, with current price action testing the strength of short-term support levels. While retracements are common after major breakouts, some analysts note that Bitcoin\u2019s decline has been sharper than that of Ethereum and many altcoins, which have either held their ground or continued to climb. Top analyst Axel Adler pointed out a significant shift in sentiment following the ATH. According to his insights, bears began aggressively shorting immediately after the price peak, leading to a sharp drop in bullish dominance. Most notably, the long-to-short ratio flipped into negative territory for the first time in weeks, signaling a clear rise in short interest across derivatives platforms. This pivot in positioning reflects growing caution among traders and raises the stakes for bulls. The $117,000 level is now seen as a key support zone\u2014if Bitcoin fails to hold above it, a deeper correction could follow, potentially dragging the broader market down with it. The timing is especially critical. This week, the US Congress kicks off \u201cCrypto Week,\u201d a series of discussions and potential votes on important legislation that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets. The outcome of these debates may act as a catalyst for renewed bullish momentum\u2014or deepen the correction if uncertainty dominates. As markets brace for clarity, all eyes remain on Bitcoin\u2019s ability to defend $117K and reclaim its short-term trend. Related Reading: $30B In Bitcoin Added By Accumulator Wallets: Are Long-Term Players Preparing Early? BTC Pulls Back: $114K\u2013$117K Key Zone to Watch The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin retracing sharply after reaching an all-time high of $123,200 earlier this week. Currently trading at $116,900, BTC has dropped over 5% from its recent peak, marking its first significant correction since the breakout above $109,300. This pullback brings Bitcoin back toward the $114,000\u2013$117,000 zone, which now acts as short-term support. This area coincides with the rising 50-period simple moving average (SMA) at $114,466 and is closely aligned with the previous breakout structure. A successful retest of this level could provide the foundation for a new leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm However, failure to hold this zone could open the door for a deeper correction toward the $109,300 support level, which served as a multi-week resistance throughout May and June. The bearish momentum on the latest candles, combined with high sell volume, reflects rising short-term uncertainty. Despite this, Bitcoin remains above all major moving averages on this timeframe (50, 100, and 200 SMAs), indicating that the broader trend is still intact.

Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum\u2019s lead. Still, the network\u2019s mix of smart\u2011contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start. For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on\u2011chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

      "summary": "In a major display of bullish momentum, the market\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), surged to a new record high on Monday, surpassing $123,000 for the first time. US House Kicks Off &#8216;Crypto Week The Bitcoin price climbed more than 90% year-to-date with Monday\u2019s rally, reaching $123,200, and reflecting a nearly 15% increase over the past month. This upward momentum coincides with the US House of Representatives&#8217; \u201ccrypto week,\u201d which will feature debates on legislation aimed at reducing regulatory hurdles that have long been viewed as obstacles for the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23\u2014Is It Too Far-Fetched? One of the key pieces of legislation set for discussion in the House is the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. Proponents of the GENIUS Act argue that it is a groundbreaking initiative that formalizes a critical aspect of the cryptocurrency industry. They believe it will enhance consumer protections, facilitate the entry of traditional financial institutions, and contribute to the growth of the digital currency market. Conversely, critics assert that the bill represents a \u201cweak set of regulations\u201d that may not adequately safeguard consumers or prevent illicit trading activities involving stablecoins. Growing Support For Crypto Regulation In addition to the GENIUS Act, the House will also debate measures to clarify the federal government&#8217;s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies and proposals that could prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing its own digital currency. Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, remarked that this legislative push reflects a series of favorable developments for the crypto industry since President Donald Trump&#8217;s election in November. Since then, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged nearly 80%. As \u201ccrypto week\u201d unfolds, Armour suggests it signals a continuation of supportive policies under the Trump administration. However, Trump\u2019s involvement in the cryptocurrency space has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. For instance, his backing of World Liberty Financial&#8217;s stablecoin, USD1, has led to significant investments in major exchanges like Binance, which critics say creates opportunities for Trump\u2019s business to profit. Despite these concerns, Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and a White House spokesperson has stated that his financial assets are managed in a trust to avoid conflicts. Bitcoin ETFs Propel Price Surge The recent surge in Bitcoin prices has also been fueled by the US approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year. These investment vehicles have proven to be successful, with record-breaking amounts of capital moving into them. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: \u2018XRP Train Has Left The Station \u2013 Analyst The overall asset value of Bitcoin ETFs has reached a record high of over $158 billion, driven by a wave of investments that included over a billion dollars flowing into these funds on consecutive days last week. Nikhil Bhatia, a finance professor at the University of Southern California, noted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has contributed significantly to institutional adoption of Bitcoin, signaling a return to a bullish market sentiment. As of this writing, BTC\u2019s price has retraced back to the $117,000 level, 4.3% below its recently achieved all-time high. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-monster-rally-amid-brewing-altcoin-season/",
      "summary": "In livestream that stretched beyond the hour\u2011mark, technical analyst Kevin (Kev Capital TA) laid out the most compelling bullish case for Dogecoin since the meme\u2011coin\u2019s April lows. Speaking to a cross\u2011platform audience, Kevin argued that the market is standing \u201cright on the verge of a genuine altcoin season,\u201d and that the textbook double\u2011bottom visible on Dogecoin\u2019s higher\u2011time\u2011frame chart positions the asset for what he called \u201ca monster move\u201d once resistance levels yield. Dogecoin Chart Turns Bullish Kevin began by situating Dogecoin inside a broader macro chessboard. This week\u2019s cascade of inflation data\u2014CPI and PPI prints bracketed by near\u2011continuous Federal Reserve commentary\u2014could inject volatility, he conceded, but the direction of trend is already set by structural forces. \u201cTrueflation is sitting at 1.71 percent,\u201d he noted, adding that the crowdsourced gauge routinely prints about sixty to seventy basis points beneath official Bureau of Labor Statistics data. \u201cAnything under two is good. It means inflation isn\u2019t the story.\u201d Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23\u2014Is It Too Far-Fetched? With macro risks in check, his focus narrowed to USDT dominance, the metric he has used all cycle to time rotations into riskier assets. Tether\u2019s market\u2011share chart has completed a bear\u2011flag breakdown and is now pressing the 0.786 Fibonacci support band at roughly 4.14 percent. \u201cWhen money\u2011flow is deep red on USDT\u2011D, that\u2019s the green light for altcoins,\u201d he said, emphasising that fresh downside in the stablecoin gauge would coincide almost mechanically with upside in DOGE. A hotter\u2011than\u2011expected CPI could deliver a short, counter\u2011trend bounce in USDT\u2011D, \u201cbut the path of least resistance is lower,\u201d he insisted. The anchor for Kevin\u2019s bullish thesis is an unmistakable double\u2011bottom on Dogecoin\u2019s weekly chart that formed exactly on the macro 0.382 retracement of the 2024\u201325 advance and directly atop a multi\u2011year down\u2011trend line. \u201cFlip the chart upside\u2011down,\u201d he told viewers, \u201cand you\u2019d run from it\u2014it looks like a perfect double\u2011top. Flip it back and it\u2019s a gift.\u201d Volume profiles confirm the pattern: sellers exhausted themselves on the second dip, while relative\u2011strength momentum created a higher low, an early signal that bulls are wresting control. Kevin\u2019s conviction draws added weight from what is unfolding in the aggregate altcoin indices. Total 3\u2014market\u2011cap ex\u2011Bitcoin and ex\u2011Ether\u2014has slammed into a resistance \u201cyellow box\u201d that capped rallies all spring, yet the analyst believes the ceiling will crack soon. A pending daily golden cross on Total 2 (market\u2011cap ex\u2011Bitcoin) marks the fourth of the cycle; each prior cross generated a brief pullback of 9\u201119 percent before giving way to fresh highs. \u201cGolden crosses are lagging, so you manage risk here\u2014pay yourself a little\u2014but the trend is higher once the dust settles,\u201d he said. For Dogecoin specifically, Kevin identified a hierarchy of breakout objectives: the local range high at $0.21, the $0.48 pivot from 2024, and the former all\u2011time high near $0.74. Beyond that he flagged extensions at $1.32 and $2.00, noting that targets lose utility if projected too far in advance. \u201cWe analyse the here and now; we let the chart earn the next level,\u201d he cautioned, before reminding newcomers that DOGE is already a ten\u2011bagger off its June 2024 trough\u2014a feat matched by few large\u2011cap tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It\u2019s No Meme While audience questions repeatedly drifted towards Elon Musk and X and Tesla integration rumors, Kevin waved off the cult of personality. \u201cDogecoin doesn\u2019t need Elon,\u201d he said bluntly. The meme\u2011coin\u2019s 10\u00d7 rebound happened \u201cwith zero help from the world\u2019s richest man,\u201d and any future endorsement would likely serve as accelerant rather than spark. What matters, in his view, is liquidity: specifically, the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance\u2011sheet trajectory and the timing of its eventual pivot away from quantitative tightening. \u201cWhen QT ends, Bitcoin dominance tops. Then you get the real alt\u2011season,\u201d he said, pointing to a perfect inverse correlation between Fed asset\u2011runoff periods and historical altcoin booms. Ending the session, the analyst projected that a decisive weekly close above Bitcoin\u2019s 1.886 fib at $120,000\u2014and a simultaneous rollover in USDT dominance\u2014would ignite the next leg. In that scenario, Dogecoin\u2019s double\u2011bottom would evolve into a full trend\u2011reversal, vaulting price into territory last visited during the meme\u2011mania of 2021. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet,\u201d he concluded. \u201cStay calm, stay cool, and let the chart do the work.\u201d At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19126.

Possible 53% Drop For Bitcoin The firm\u2019s study outlines a base-case scenario for Bitcoin at $128,000 by year-end, with a more pessimistic outlook placing it as low as $55,000, which could mean a major 53% crash from current prices.

Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: \u2018XRP Train Has Left The Station \u2013 Analyst On July 14, Strategy purchased an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, averaging $111,827 per coin. This latest acquisition brings the company\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 601,550 BTC. Analysts at TD Cowen noted that what began as a defensive measure to preserve the value of its assets has evolved into a proactive strategy aimed at enhancing shareholder value. Strategy plans to continue acquiring Bitcoin through proceeds from upcoming debt and equity offerings. The firm anticipates that Strategy will raise around $84 billion through its innovative \u201c42/42\u201d plan, which involves an equal mix of debt and equity, potentially increasing its Bitcoin reserves to 900,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Strategy As Strong Investment Option TD Cowen has initiated buy ratings on Strategy\u2019s preferred shares, emphasizing their attractive income potential and price appreciation, which are expected to be less volatile than common shares or Bitcoin itself. This endorsement comes after the firm first recognized Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin strategy in 2023, describing it as a \u201cparadigm shift.\u201d At that time, they highlighted the company&#8217;s approach of utilizing cash from its software business to invest in Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against dollar inflation. Analysts believe that Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply makes it a more reliable store of value compared to traditional currencies or gold, presenting Strategy as an appealing option for investors looking to gain Bitcoin exposure.

As institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies accelerates, Strategy\u2019s acquisition strategy has become a blueprint for other corporate treasuries. The company&#8217;s total investment in Bitcoin now stands at $29.27 billion, yielding substantial unrealized gains with a cost basis of $71,268 per BTC. The latest report and Strategy\u2019s recent purchase coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high, surpassing $123,000, underscoring the growing acceptance and adoption of BTC in the financial landscape. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency has retraced to $117,000 in an attempt to find its next support level before moving on to uncharted territory once again if buying demand persists among investors.
