      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-100000-2/",
      "summary": "After the Bitcoin price breakdown below $100,000 over the weekend, multiple new narratives have emerged for where the digital asset may be headed. Calls for the next Bitcoin bear market continue to ring loud as analysts predict lower prices. One crypto analyst, known on X as Astronomer, has taken to the platform to give investors a possible roadmap of where the cryptocurrency is headed next and where to start buying for maximum gains. Next Course Of Action After Crash Following the Bitcoin price crash, Astronomer pointed out that the price had fallen below the expected close. However, it seems that the decline was not completely over, as there could be another final drop. This could come after the market reversal that has taken hold over the last few days, presenting another buy opportunity. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk Of 20% Crash To $1.55 If This Level Fails To Hold From here, the crypto analyst explains that there could be a reversal toward the $95,000 level, and also a possibility of a bounce toward $110,000. As a result of this, the next area of action that investors could start buying from is placed at the $97,000 level, but the price could go lower. Astronomer explains that weekend lows are usually taken out, and with this weekend low still above $97,000, the price could revisit this territory. Nevertheless, the analyst explains that those who have been sidelined throughout the rally, or those who want to begin getting into the market, the Bitcoin price at around $97,000 is a good place to start. In addition to the current market factors, the analyst also points to sentiment and geopolitics as supporting the analysis. \u201cIt&#8217;s a shame we have to take advantage of blood being shed, from what&#8217;s happening in the world, but also from the bears soon at the end of this dip,\u201d the analyst said. Where Is The Bitcoin Price Headed? With the announcement from US President Donald Trump that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, the market has already seen a recovery, with the Bitcoin price rallying to $106,000 initially. This has already triggered a turn in the sentiment from Fear back to Greed as investors begin piling in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Above 66% \u2013 How This 4-Year ATH Affects Altcoin Season In a subsequent post, Astronomer explains that missing out on the buy below $97,000 is no cause for alarm. But cautions against buying now due to fear. The analyst explains that such a move is not advisable as it could lead to losses, as buying during high euphoric times is not advisable. Given this, it is likely better to wait for a correction before going into the market. \u201cBuying higher now during high euphoric times (especially locally), is a worse idea,\u201d Astronomer warned. \u201cCreate good habits, create a solid plan, and stick to both.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "On-chain data shows Tron (TRX) observed a large profit-taking spike earlier in the month. Which type of holder was responsible for the move? Tron SOPR Saw A Huge Spike Earlier In The Month In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has talked about the recent trend in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of Tron. The SOPR refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about whether the TRX investors are moving or selling their coins at a profit or loss. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin being moved to see what price it was last transacted at. Coins that have this cost basis above the current spot price are contributing to loss realization, while those with the opposite setup to profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound The SOPR takes the ratio between the spent value and cost basis, and sums it up for all coins being sold on the blockchain to find a net situation for the market as a whole. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are, on average, realizing a profit through their transactions. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the dominance of loss realization in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the Tron SOPR over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron SOPR saw a huge spike above the 1 mark earlier in the month, implying investors took part in a significant amount of profit-taking. From the chart, it&#8217;s also visible that there were other profit realization spikes during the past year, but the current one stands out for its scale. The latest peak in the metric saw its value go to 4.74, corresponding to a profit margin of 374%. &#8220;With TRX priced at $0.268 at the time, the average acquisition price for those coins would have been around $0.0566,&#8221; explains Maartunn. Interestingly, Tron hasn&#8217;t seen extended periods around this price mark since late 2022, meaning that the tokens would have been held for a good while before being finally transacted this month. Usually, when dormant hands break their silence, it&#8217;s likely to be for selling-related purposes. That said, it&#8217;s not the only reason they may do so. &#8220;The activity could be tied to early investors realizing gains, internal transfers, or reallocation decisions,&#8221; notes the analyst.
