      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dominance-continues-historic-climb-altcoins-struggle-to-gain-ground/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has officially entered a new chapter in its bull market, surging to fresh all-time highs near $118,800 after weeks of tight consolidation. This decisive breakout marks a pivotal shift in momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential explosive leg higher as bullish sentiment returns. The move above previous highs has not only reignited interest in BTC but also fueled optimism across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 \u2013 Price Magnet Forming One of the most telling indicators of the current cycle\u2019s strength is Bitcoin Dominance. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, BTC dominance has climbed to 65% since the beginning of this bull market. This sharp increase highlights a clear preference among investors for Bitcoin over altcoins, solidifying its position as the market\u2019s anchor in times of volatility and growth. As Bitcoin leads the charge, market watchers believe the breakout could trigger a wave of institutional inflows and renewed attention from sidelined retail investors. With momentum building and confidence growing, the breakout above $118K may just be the start of an even larger move, one that could define the next phase of the 2025 crypto bull cycle. Bitcoin Leads The Charge After weeks of sideways consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, launching a new bullish phase and pushing the broader crypto market into motion. Altcoins, which had lagged in recent months, are now climbing above key resistance levels as confidence spreads. This coordinated move comes amid a backdrop of macroeconomic shifts, with market participants increasingly anticipating a weakening US dollar and the return of inflationary policies under US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. With expectations of rate cuts looming and pressure mounting on the Federal Reserve, the market sees crypto\u2014especially Bitcoin\u2014as a natural hedge. However, caution still lingers. US Treasury yields remain elevated, continuing to flash warnings of systemic stress in the traditional financial system. That tension has only strengthened Bitcoin\u2019s appeal as a non-sovereign, hard-capped monetary asset. Bitcoin dominance tells the story clearly. \u201cAt the start of this bull market, it sat at 40%. Today? 65%,\u201d noted On-Chain Mind, emphasizing how investor preference has overwhelmingly leaned toward BTC. This dominance reflects a trend that has barely flinched, even as Ethereum and other altcoins attempt to catch up. As BTC leads the market higher, its dominance reinforces its role as the primary beneficiary of macro uncertainty. While the altcoin space is beginning to show signs of life, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin remains the anchor, and investors aren\u2019t ready to rotate just yet.

Price surged from the long-standing resistance at $109,300 to a local high of $118,000 in less than twelve hours, marking an 8% rally. This breakout flipped prior resistance into support and triggered strong volume, validating the move. Volume has decreased during this period, which is characteristic of a bullish consolidation rather than distribution. The 50-period moving average (blue) has crossed above the 100-period (green), forming a short-term golden cross near $109K. This crossover supports a bullish outlook, with the 200-period moving average (red) trending upward from $105K, reinforcing the structure of higher lows.

      "summary": "Ethereum has finally broken above the critical $2,850 level, igniting momentum across the broader altcoin market. After weeks of sideways trading, this breakout marks a potential turning point, as many altcoins followed ETH\u2019s lead with sharp upward moves. Analysts are calling this shift the early stages of a new altseason \u2014 a period where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin and deliver significant gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 \u2013 Details Among those spotlighting Ethereum\u2019s strength is Ryan Sean Adams, founder of Mythos Capital, who took to X to highlight the strategic evolution of Ethereum\u2019s positioning. \u201cThe ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months,\u201d he wrote, referring to his earlier thesis of Ethereum as a global, productive asset. This renewed narrative, focused on Ethereum as a yield-generating, store-of-value asset backed by an active economy, appears to be resonating with institutional and retail investors alike. With Ethereum leading the market and altcoins gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether this rally can sustain and confirm the start of a broader bullish phase for the crypto market. Ethereum Undervaluation Sparks New Narrative Since 2022, Ethereum has been underperforming against Bitcoin, with altcoins suffering as a result. While Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto narrative \u2014 recently breaking into new all-time highs \u2014 Ethereum still trades more than 60% below its November 2021 peak. This stark divergence has frustrated many ETH holders, but some analysts and investors now view it as a massive opportunity. Adams has become a prominent voice in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, and believes a major shift is already underway. According to Adams, the Ethereum community has successfully rebranded ETH as a \u201cblue money\u201d asset \u2014 a concept that positions Ethereum alongside traditional stores of value like gold, oil, and Bitcoin. But unlike those, ETH is backed by an on-chain economy that generates yield. \u201cWe are emphasizing ETH, the asset now,\u201d Adams wrote on X. \u201cIt\u2019s made a huge difference. Keep going. ETH = world reserve asset.\u201d His bold, almost maximalist stance is a call for the market to reassess Ethereum\u2019s fundamental value. Rather than seeing it solely as infrastructure for decentralized apps, Adams argues that Ethereum is maturing into a globally viable reserve asset \u2014 one that offers both security and yield. If that narrative continues gaining traction, ETH could be poised for a major revaluation in the months ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 \u2013 Price Magnet Forming ETH Reclaims Key Level As Bulls Regain Control Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength, surging nearly 15% on the week to trade around $2,955. This marks a successful breakout above the key resistance zone at $2,850, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout the past two years. The weekly candle shows strong bullish momentum, supported by a significant increase in trading volume. The chart reveals that ETH has now reclaimed the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, which sit at $2,644 and $2,428, respectively. Reclaiming these long-term averages is a strong technical signal that the downtrend may be over, and a new bullish phase could be starting. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level \u2013 Relief Or Reversal? Despite the breakout, Ethereum is still trading far below its all-time high near $4,900. This presents upside potential if the bullish momentum continues. With this breakout, ETH also confirms a higher low structure, reinforcing the bullish case for further gains. If price holds above $2,850 in the coming days, the next resistance zone sits around $3,300\u2013$3,600. A close above those levels could open the door to a rally toward $4,000 and beyond.

      "title": "Why The Solana Price Could Crash To $95 Before Reaching $200",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-crash-to-95-200/",
      "summary": "The Solana price has fallen by a considerable amount after hitting an all-time high of almost $300 back in January 2025. Even with the recent market recovery, the price is still sitting over 45% below its all-time high price, highlighting the struggles that the altcoin has faced in recent times. Amid this, a crypto analyst has suggested that the Solana price could crash even further from here, predicting a 40% crash could be in the cards once more. Why Solana Could See A Price Crash Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader has highlighted the development of a rare bullish harmonic pattern on the Solana price chart. Now, while this pattern formation is inherently bullish for any digital asset, the shorter term does come with some hurdles for the altcoin to surmount first. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here\u2019s What Happened Last Time The main thing to focus on here is that this bullish pattern does initially trigger a liquidity sweep of previous lows. In this case, the recent Solana price low lies at the $95 level, which is a 40% decrease from its current price, trending above $150. The possibility of this low sweep is made even more prominent by a couple of technical developments on the chart. The first technical point the analyst shows is the Point of Control (POC) Battle. According to the analysis, the Solana price is now testing this POC level with low momentum, shown by the slow climb over the last few days. Additionally, there is also mounting resistance at the Value Area High and the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which lies just above $163. Then, there is the completion of the C-leg of the wave, putting it as low as $95. A crash to this level becomes more likely if the Solana price fails to break through the resistance with conviction. If the price is rejected and the C-leg does play out, then this correction is expected to trigger the 40% crash to the $95 level. It\u2019s Not All Bearish News As already mentioned above, the bearish leg of the rare bullish harmonic pattern is only temporary and often gives way to an even stronger impulse move. As the crypto analyst explains, the crash to $95 will only happen in the immediate short term, but it does not actually invalidate the overall bullish trend. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It\u2019s Now \u2018Illegal\u2019 To Short Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why Once the D-leg is over and the crash is completed, the crypto analyst predicts that the Solana price will start to rally again. From the predicted $05 lows, an over 100% move is expected to take it back to $200 and beyond before the rally is over. The analyst explains that &#8220;Until this scenario is confirmed or invalidated, Solana remains range-bound between major high time frame levels.\u201d Therefore, \u201cTraders should stay alert for signs of rejection at current resistance \u2014 or, conversely, a volume-backed breakout above the value area high that would negate the harmonic setup.\u201d Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "In a positive development for the crypto community, the individual responsible for the GMX exploit accepted the platform\u2019s bounty and returned over $40 million worth of assets stolen from the project. Related Reading: Drop NFTs Like It\u2019s Hot: Snoop Dogg\u2019s Telegram Collection Raises $12M In 30 Minutes Crypto Hacker Takes $42 Million From GMX On Friday, the recent GMX V1 exploit ended on a happy note after the individual responsible for the incident turned into a white-hat hacker. Perpetual and spot crypto exchange GMX lost over $40 million on Wednesday when an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the protocol\u2019s first version on Arbitrum. According to online reports, GMX V1\u2019s vault contract had a vulnerability that allowed the attacker to manipulate the GLP token price through the system\u2019s calculations. Blockchain security firm SlowMist explained that \u201cThe root cause of this attack stems from GMX v1&#8217;s design flaw, where short position operations immediately update the global short average prices (globalShortAveragePrices), which directly impacts the calculation of Assets Under Management (AUM), thereby allowing manipulation of GLP token pricing.\u201d Through a reentrancy attack, they successfully established massive short positions to manipulate the global average prices, artificially inflating GLP prices within a single transaction and profiting through redemption operations. As a result, approximately $42 million worth of assets, including Legacy Frax Dollar (FRAX), wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), wrapped ETH (WETH), and other tokens, were transferred from the GLP pool to an unknown wallet. The perpetual crypto exchange halted GMX V1\u2019s trading and GLP\u2019s minting and redeeming on both Arbitrum and Avalanche to prevent another attack and protect users\u2019 funds. However, they clarified that the exploit was limited to GMX\u2019s V1 and its GLP pool. GMX V2, its markets, or liquidity pools, and the GMX token were not affected and remained safe. White-Hat Claims $5 Million Bounty Following the incident, GMX sent a message on-chain and on X offering a $5 million white-hat bounty to the attacker, claiming that their abilities were \u201cevident to anyone looking into the exploit transactions.\u201d GMX\u2019s team noted that returning the funds within the next 48 hours and accepting the bounty would allow the hacker to \u201cspend the funds freely,\u201d instead of taking additional risks to access them. They also vowed not to pursue any legal action and to assist the exploiter in providing proof of source for the funds if it is ever required. Today, the exploiter responded in an on-chain message, accepting the bounty and starting the return process. As Lookonchain reported, they initially returned $10.49 million worth of FRAX on Friday morning. Meanwhile, another $32 million worth of assets had been swapped into 11,700 ETH, which are now valued at $35 million after the King of Altcoins\u2019 price jumped to the $2,990 mark. In the following hours, the hacker returned 10,000 ETH, worth $30 million, keeping only 1,700 ETH, valued at $5.2 million, as the bounty. Related Reading: Solana Ready For $160 Reclaim? Analysts Say Breakout Is A Matter Of Time GMX later confirmed that the funds have now been safely returned and thanked the white-hat hacker for their actions, ultimately giving a positive turn to the incident.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-breaks-records-what-miners-and-leverage-traders-are-doing-behind-the-scenes/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching $118,254 and marking a notable milestone in its price trajectory. This latest milestone comes after BTC&#8217;s former high at $111,000 levels in May, representing a 10% gain over the past week and roughly 5.9% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $117,584. The sharp price increase appears to be giving strength to activity among both miners and leveraged traders, prompting a closer examination of current market behavior. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have flagged a resurgence of miner activity alongside a rise in derivative positions, suggesting multiple forces may now be contributing to price movements. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY\u2014If Treasury Firms Hold As these two segments of the market engage more actively, questions are emerging around the sustainability of this rally and whether these behaviors signal confidence or caution. The current on-chain environment shows both selling pressure from miners and increased exposure from long-positioned traders. Bitcoin Miner Activity Rises Alongside Price Surge One of CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake contributors, Arab Chain, observed a marked increase in miner activity as Bitcoin crossed the $118,000 level. According to the analyst, this uptick in activity is tied to miner transfers to exchanges, marking the first such increase since May 23. This trend suggests miners could be taking advantage of recent price gains to realize profits. As Arab Chain explained, \u201cThe continued activity of miners, coupled with Bitcoin&#8217;s price rising to new highs, clearly indicates that they are selling Bitcoin.\u201d Despite this renewed transfer volume, miner behavior has not yet reached the scale of over-the-counter (OTC) selling seen in previous months. Historically, large-scale selling by miners has introduced notable volatility into the market, particularly when sustained across a broader period. The analyst also pointed out the economic leverage miners hold in decision-making, owing to their ability to manage operational costs and balance between holding and selling mined Bitcoin. Whether this increase in exchange flows will develop into heavier selling remains to be seen. Derivatives Market Shows Renewed Leverage Exposure In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Enigma Trader focused on derivatives market activity, highlighting a 24% surge in open interest from approximately $33 billion on July 1 to over $41 billion by July 11. The timing of this increase coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s breakout above $118,000, and reflects renewed leveraged interest following a reset late last month. This level of open interest suggests that traders are positioning more aggressively, potentially anticipating continued upside. The analyst also noted a shift in funding rates from negative to their highest positive reading in a month, around 0.012% per eight hours. Positive funding indicates that long-positioned traders are paying to maintain their positions, a sign of bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback However, Enigma Trader cautioned that such positioning can become precarious if momentum slows. \u201cThis setup often fuels upside continuation if spot demand backs it, but also increases the risk of a long squeeze should momentum stall,\u201d the analyst wrote.
