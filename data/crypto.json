This link to big names has drawn fresh eyes to Tron\u2019s ecosystem. On-Chain Growth Signals According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked on Tron reached over $5 billion. On June 6, the network saw 4.50 million returning user addresses. Those stats suggest people keep coming back to DeFi apps on Tron, but it\u2019s worth watching whether those funds stay in place or chase higher yields on other chains. Bullish Bets in Derivatives Based on CoinGlass data, TRX derivatives open interest rose by 8.25% over the past 24 hours to $329 million. The weighted funding rate open interest rose to 0.0098%, indicative that bullish long positions are greater than shorts. Short liquidations in the past day were almost double that of longs, which settled a bearish bet wave. Technical analysis supports this positive perspective. The RSI on the daily chart is inching up to the overbought region, indicating heightened buying pressure. A recent MACD crossover drove histogram bars into positive territory, which means momentum has favored the buyers. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million?

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-tests-ascending-channel-resistance-breakout-or-breakdown/",
      "summary": "Ethereum pushed above the $2,820 mark yesterday, strengthening the bullish case for a breakout after weeks of consolidation. The move has created renewed optimism among traders who expect ETH to rally beyond its current range and begin a new upward leg. Despite lingering global tensions, markets are responding positively to growing speculation that a trade deal between the US and China may soon be finalized, offering a temporary boost to risk assets across the board. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level \u2013 Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Ethereum\u2019s recent strength comes at a critical moment, as price approaches the upper boundary of its current ascending channel. Top analyst M-log1 shared a technical analysis highlighting this structure, stating that ETH needs to break out of this current channel. Until then, price action may remain contained within the structure, with limited upside unless a decisive breakout occurs. As Ethereum pushes toward resistance, all eyes are on volume and confirmation signals that could mark the start of a broader trend. For bulls, breaking above the ascending channel could signal the beginning of a strong move toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, Ethereum remains at a key inflection point in its cycle. Ethereum Holds The Key To Altseason Ts Bulls Eye Breakout Ethereum is now at the center of the market\u2019s attention, as its next move could determine whether a true altseason begins. While Bitcoin continues to lead, Ethereum\u2019s ability to reclaim higher price levels\u2014particularly above the $2,800 mark\u2014will be critical in confirming the start of a broader altcoin rally. So far, positive sentiment and rising price action suggest momentum is building, with ETH pushing into resistance and forming a constructive setup. Bulls have regained control in recent sessions, but the challenge now lies in escaping the current structure. M-log1 highlighted that Ethereum remains trapped in an ascending channel, a pattern that often leads to slow grinding moves until a breakout or breakdown occurs. \u201cIf we want anything significant to happen,\u201d he noted, \u201cthen ETH needs to leave this ascending channel.\u201d Failing to do so increases the probability of a revisit to the lower end of the range, though M-log1 clarified that this isn\u2019t a certainty\u2014just a probability to keep in mind. On a positive note, Ethereum\u2019s moving averages continue to trend upward and support price from below, providing a favorable technical backdrop. As long as these levels hold and bulls remain active, the breakout scenario remains the dominant outlook. If ETH can decisively flip $2,800 into support and break above the channel structure, it could unleash a wave of capital rotation into altcoins. Until then, Ethereum holds the spotlight\u2014and its next move will likely shape the direction of the entire market heading into summer. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level \u2013 No Clear Breakout Yet Ethereum Breaks Above Resistance But Faces Retest At Key Level Ethereum is currently trading at $2,771 on the daily chart after briefly breaking above the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This level has capped price action multiple times since early May, making this breakout attempt a significant development. However, today\u2019s rejection from a high of $2,834 suggests that ETH is not yet ready to confirm a clean breakout and may be entering a short-term retest phase. The $2,750\u2013$2,800 zone, now acting as immediate resistance, aligns closely with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,654.52 \u2014 a historically important level that often dictates medium-term trend direction. ETH\u2019s recent surge above all major moving averages, including the 50-day ($2,333.32) and 100-day ($2,085.42) SMAs, reflects growing bullish momentum and a strong trend structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens \u2013 Tower Top Pattern In Play? If Ethereum holds above the 200-day SMA on a retest and reclaims $2,800 with follow-through, the path toward $3,000 becomes more realistic. On the other hand, failure to hold this area could result in a slide back toward the $2,600\u2013$2,650 support zone. Volume has picked up, indicating interest, but confirmation will come from sustained price above resistance. For now, ETH remains in a promising position \u2014 but the next few candles will be key.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-could-hit-73-research-firm-bullish-outlook/",
      "summary": "An extended technical review aired Tuesday on Sistine Research\u2019s YouTube channel has placed XRP at the top of the current market hierarchy and mapped a price trajectory that\u2014if historical analogues and present chart structure hold\u2014could lift the token as high as $73 in a late-cycle blow-off. Speaking during the firm\u2019s regular live-stream, analyst Forrest began by ranking assets that have rallied since the US election on 5 November 2024. \u201cXRP is the number-one performing coin since the election, the strongest coin on my watch-list,\u201d he said, displaying a four-hour relative-performance chart that compared crypto majors, select altcoins, metals and equities. The next-best performers\u2014HBAR and XLM\u2014were described as \u201cbeta\u201d plays that historically accelerate only after XRP begins to trend. Can XRP Reach $73 This Cycle? Forrest\u2019s thesis hinges on what he called a \u201cseven-year flag and breakout\u201d visible on XRP\u2019s monthly time frame. The pattern comprises the long consolidation that followed the 2017 bull market and a second, five-month bull flag carved out this year. \u201cWhy would I not own a chart that looks like this?\u201d he asked, noting the rarity of multi-cycle structures that break decisively to the upside without retracing the move. In his view, the next critical trigger sits above $3.00\u20133.30, where XRP\u2019s prior all-time high was set in January 2018. Once breached, the analyst argues, momentum traders who \u201cfeel like they\u2019ve missed it\u201d will encounter a higher-time-frame market that is in fact just warming up: \u201cAbove three dollars I get even more bullish. The higher this goes, the more bullish it becomes\u2014up to a point, of course.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Eyes $2.50 Decision Zone As Macro Wave Structure Takes Shape Forrest offered a ladder of profit-taking zones: $7\u201310 \u2014 initial resistance where early longs may start trimming. $17\u201337 \u2014 an intermediate band calibrated from Fibonacci extensions and prior percentage moves. $73 \u2014 the \u201cabsolute\u201d target, projected by measuring the full height of the 2017 breakout and extending it from the current flag\u2019s pivot. He acknowledged that the $73 figure \u201csounds crazy\u201d with XRP trading near $2.28 at the time of the stream but argued that similarly outsized moves materialised in past crypto supercycles. During the 2017 run, XRP advanced roughly 1,400% from its breakout flag; applying a comparable ratio to today\u2019s structure yields Forrest\u2019s upper bound. While the tone remained unambiguously bullish, the analyst did outline scenarios that would invalidate the thesis. A decisive breakdown below the present trading range\u2014he cited the $1.80\u20131.90 area\u2014could force a \u201cround-trip\u201d to the mid-$1 zone and delay the upward resolution. For now, however, he sees range-bound price action as constructive: \u201cAs long as we\u2019re holding range, I\u2019m not entertaining the deep retrace.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash \u2013 Here Are The Targets Forrest also distinguished between holding spot XRP\u2014\u201ca no-brainer\u201d\u2014and employing leverage, reminding viewers that structural targets are measured in months and that leveraged positions may not survive interim volatility. Sistine Research\u2019s macro overlay remains resolutely pro-risk through the summer. The firm\u2019s proprietary \u201cBitcoin Blueprint\u201d identified the 7 June\u201321 June window as a historically bullish pocket. That seasonal tailwind, combined with the technical setup, underpins Forrest\u2019s conviction that XRP will continue to outperform not only rival tokens but also traditional safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, which the firm nonetheless holds as portfolio hedges. Whether XRP can emulate its 2017 trajectory will depend on broader liquidity conditions, regulatory milestones in the ongoing SEC litigation, and the extent to which institutional flows diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yet the Sistine Research desk is positioned as though the heavy lifting is already under way: \u201cIt\u2019s slowed down a little recently, but I expect this overall trend to continue.\u201d At press time, XRP traded at $2.32.

      "summary": "Solana (SOL) has surged 6.6% over the past week, raising hopes among holders that the digital asset may be on the cusp of a significant rally &#8211; one that could potentially propel it to new all-time highs (ATH). A combination of strengthening fundamentals and bullish technical signals supports this optimistic outlook. Solana Primed For A Spectacular Summer? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, SOL is currently undergoing a cooling phase on both the spot and futures Bubble Maps. The analyst shared the following chart to highlight this cooling period. For the uninitiated, a bubble map visualizes volume data across exchanges, with each bubble representing trading activity for a specific pair or platform. The size of the bubble indicates the total volume, while the color shows the intensity or change in that volume &#8211; such as cooling (green), neutral (gray), or overheating (red). Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart \u2013 Rally Ahead? At first glance, lower trading volume might seem like fading momentum. However, the CryptoQuant analyst suggests this deceleration could be a strategic accumulation phase, particularly as a potential catalyst looms on the horizon. Many in the crypto community are expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the first Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the coming weeks. In an X post published today, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, said Solana could lead a \u201cpotential altcoin ETF summer.\u201d Meanwhile, predictions platform Polymarket currently places a 91% probability on a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 &#8211; the highest odds recorded since January of this year. Most speculators expect a SOL ETF to go live by July 2025. From a technical standpoint, things are also looking encouraging. In a recent X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that if SOL breaks above the $200 mark, it could kickstart a 5x to 10x bull run. Martinez shared the following SOL weekly chart, which shows the digital asset forming a bullish Cup and Handle pattern. While the \u201ccup\u201d portion has already been completed, the emerging \u201chandle\u201d suggests the potential for significant price appreciation &#8211; possibly pushing SOL beyond $2,000. SOL Showing Promise But Take Caution Despite widespread optimism, some indicators urge caution. On-chain data recently revealed a large movement of dormant SOL coins, which has raised concerns about increased selling pressure in the near term.
