      "summary": "US traders and DeFi fans have turned their eyes to Sei Network (SEI) after its Total Value Locked (TVL) climbed past $626 million. That leap marks a huge rise from about $60 million at the start of 2024, showing a strong wave of new funds and fresh users staking assets on the chain. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Sei Network TVL Rockets According to DeFiLlama, TVL on Sei surged from roughly $60 million in January 2024 to almost $700 million at its peak. That represents nearly a 10 \u00d7 gain in just six months\u2014growth most rival chains only manage in single\u2011digit or low double\u2011digit jumps of 10\u201350 % over the same stretch. Based on reports by crypto fans on X, this kind of TVL swing is very rare in today\u2019s tight market. $SEI just set a new all-time high for Total Value Locked, climbing past $625 million. \ud83d\udcc8 More capital flowing in, more on-chain activity picking up &#8211; the SEI ecosystem\u2019s clearly pulling in fresh attention. pic.twitter.com/xqruXfoqVn \u2014 Kyledoops (@kyledoops) July 7, 2025 On\u2011Chain Activity Picks Up Crypto observer Kyledoops shared that daily transfers and smart\u2011contract calls on Sei have climbed steadily. \u201cMore capital is flowing in and on\u2011chain actions are rising,\u201d he wrote. Some market observers say that some parts of the ecosystem saw 10\u201350 % jumps in TVL, with a few protocols posting even bigger gains. This buzz comes at a time when many DeFi projects are struggling to grow. Japan Approval Draws Investors Based on reports, a key boost arrived when Sei earned approval from the Japan Financial Services Agency. That nod gives it a regulated path into one of the world\u2019s strictest crypto markets. Artemis Analytics noted that daily active addresses hit a two\u2011year high right after the JFSA greenlight. Institutions are said to be taking a closer look at trading and custody options in Tokyo. $SEI just received approval from Japan\u2019s FSA It is required in Japan to be listed on exchanges so quite important.

Even with that jump, the coin still sits about 78 % below its March 2024 peak, trading around $0.26 today. Some technical analysts point to a chart floor at $0.25. A breach there could push SEI closer to $0.20, which would put pressure on holders who bought in at higher levels. Related Reading: 2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands \u2014 But Who Is He? Sei Price Forecast According to current projections, SEI is set to drop by 25% and reach $0.19 by August 8, 2025. Based on technical indicators, market sentiment remains Bullish while the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 66 (Greed). Over the last 30 days, SEI logged 17/30 (57%) green days and saw 19% price swings in that window. These figures suggest that short\u2011term dips could be sharp, but buyers may view lower prices as a chance to get in. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrps-to-1000-will-happen-soon/",
      "summary": "XRP might be currently trading around $2, but its path to double and four digits may be faster than imagined. Notably, a bold new forecast has shaken up the XRP community, as crypto analyst BarriC declared that the token could explode from $2 to $1,000 much faster than anyone expects. His comments have caused a bit of optimism among investors, many of whom are already eyeing a new all-time high as momentum builds following the cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent quarterly close above $2.25. XRP\u2019s Rise To $1,000 Based On History Taking to the social media platform X, prominent analyst BarriC predicted that the XRP price will surge to $1,000 a lot sooner than most people anticipate. Notably, BarriC\u2019s prediction of a surge draws on the cryptocurrency\u2019s historical performance. Related Reading: Can The XRP Price Rally 1,538x To Reach $3,380? Shocking Prediction Back in 2017, XRP was trading at just $0.006 before launching into a parabolic bull run that took it as high as $3.40 by early 2018. Investors back then underestimated this move, and only a few were able to get in at the earliest. This $3.40 all-time high has been maintained by the altcoin for over seven years, but the situation might change very soon. The altcoin&#8217;s current price level, which is just above $2, is a mirror of that early accumulation phase. According to BarriC, investors today may similarly be underestimating how quickly XRP can move. \u201cPeople buying XRP at $0.006 in 2017 weren\u2019t expecting it to skyrocket to $3.80,\u201d he wrote on X and suggested that a similar underestimation is happening today. Community Torn Between Hope And Doubt His claim, \u201cXRP will skyrocket from $2 to $1,000 a lot sooner than people anticipate,\u201d has been met with mixed reactions of both excitement and skepticism on the social media platform. Some community members were quick to support BarriC\u2019s outlook, with one user responding, \u201cXRP $1,400 is very realistic.\u201d The statement was in reference to its 63,000% rise in the 2017-2018 bull run emphasized by BarriC. Another user commented that although XRP will definitely reach that price level, it won&#8217;t be very soon, and it will be &#8220;maybe sometime in 2030 to 2040.&#8221; Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen Others, however, urged caution, pointing out that XRP is no longer an underdog. Unlike in 2017, XRP\u2019s growth is now very much anticipated, which may dampen the element of surprise that helped its rally seven years ago. Another factor is the current state of the altcoin, along with the significant inflows that could lead to a rally of 63,000% from its current price level. One of the commenters noted that back in 2018, it was possible to invest as little as $6,000 and own as many as 1 million XRP tokens. Another community member noted that although XRP might not reach such an absurd price target, it is going to break out soon to around $10. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.33, up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Reaching the $1,000 price target would translate to a 42,800% return from the current levels.

      "title": "Is Dogecoin Prepping For Takeoff? Fib Reaction And Trend Support Say Yes",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-prepping-for-takeoff/",
      "summary": "Dogecoin may be gearing up for its next breakout. After holding firm near $0.17 on the weekly chart, DOGE recently bounced off key Fibonacci and trendline support, hinting at renewed bullish potential. With its 200\u2011week moving average offering steady support and price comfortably above the ascending channel, technicals suggest the setup is aligning. If the recent dip toward the 200 MA on the M15 chart proves to be a low-risk entry, this could set the stage for a retest of the $0.16490 resistance, and possibly more. Rejection At Resistance, But Technicals Still Favor Bulls In a recent analysis shared on X, Thomas Anderson presented a detailed breakdown of DOGE/USD price action across the M15 and M30 timeframes. According to the expert, Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.17043, and the price is facing rejection at the yellow horizontal resistance line around $0.16490. The price action shows consolidation just below this key level, signaling indecision among traders. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline Anderson pointed out that the 200 MA (red line) is acting as dynamic support from below, helping to anchor the price during the current consolidation phase. This moving average support provides bulls the foundation to regain control if momentum shifts in their favor. On the M30 chart, Anderson noted that the broader bullish structure remains intact, with DOGE price holding above the ascending trendline. This technical pattern suggests continued optimism for upward movement, provided the price does not break below key support areas. Thomas Anderson concluded that any pullback toward the 200 MA on the M15 timeframe could offer a buying opportunity, particularly for traders eyeing a retest of the $0.16490 resistance. Dogecoin Weekly Chart Echoes Elliott Theory\u2019s Bullish Blueprint Taking a closer look at Dogecoin\u2019s weekly chart, crypto analyst Andrew observed a notable long-term wave structure unfolding. He explained that over the past three years, DOGE has completed a five-wave impulse to the upside, which was followed by a typical ABC correction, consistent with Elliott Wave theory. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes Breakout \u2014 Can Bulls Unleash the Next Surge? Andrew further noted that price found a strong reaction at the 0.786 Fibonacci level, marked by a light blue line, which traces the retracement from the entire upward move. This reaction suggests that DOGE may have reached a critical support area, where buyers could begin stepping in. With this in mind, Andrew believes the current structure appears to be forming a larger 1-2 setup, which could lead to a powerful Wave 3 advance. If this pattern plays out, it may signal the start of a new bullish phase with the potential to break beyond previous highs. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Ledger has announced a limited-time 30% discount on nearly all color models of its popular Nano S Plus and Nano X hardware wallets, valid through July 15. The promotion has drawn fresh attention to the company\u2019s flagship products, widely regarded as industry benchmarks for secure crypto storage. Together, the Nano S Plus and Nano X boast 13,345 reviews, the majority of which are positive, underscoring the strong trust and satisfaction among users worldwide. But what makes Ledger such a popular hardware wallet? Ledger Wallet\u2019s Blend of Security, Comfort, and Style \u2013 this is what makes them so attractive to its loyal fanbase and newbies alike. Ledger excels in the areas of security, comfort level, and overall style, but it\u2019s the wallet\u2019s security features that attract users. Ledger relies on a multi-layered security profile, with several noticeable features, like: \u2705 The PIN code that secures the actual device to prevent unauthorized access is required to complete any transaction \u2705 The 24-word phrase, which acts as the master key, secures your funds against any malicious access \u2705 The trademark Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System (BOLOS), which isolates any installed apps from one another and the 24-word phrase from all apps and the operating system itself \u2705 Secure Element Chip, the hardware component that keeps the private keys offline for a higher level of security Plus, Ledger\u2019s Donjon team, which consists of seasoned hackers, is constantly testing the products\u2019 security to identify any potential vulnerabilities. Their efforts are part of Ledger\u2019s Bug Bounty program, which rewards anyone who finds security weaknesses in Bitcoin, showcasing the team\u2019s commitment to continuous improvements in the security department. While security is the most important aspect, other features matter as well, like the comfort level associated with carrying and using the wallet. Ledger\u2019s Nano S Plus and Nano X are the sleekest and most comfortable to use and wear, thanks to their slim builds. Nano S Plus consists of steel and plastic, weighing only 0.74 ounces, while Nano X is slightly larger, thanks to the lithium battery, reaching 1.19 ounces. The slim format makes them comfortable to wear, even as keychains if you always insist on having them with you. Finally, the color palette offers a final touch to the already unique style, imbuing the wallets with a modern vibe. Colors like emerald-green, sapphire-blue, and amethyst-purple come with a plus of personality and X factor. The Massive 30% Discount Ends on July 15 Ledger\u2019s flash promotion (offering a 30% discount on its Nano S Plus and Nano X wallets) is set to end on July 15, giving buyers less than a week to take advantage. The deal aims to spotlight two of Ledger\u2019s most widely used products, with a combined user base of around 7 million worldwide. Most color options are eligible, with only onyx-black and BTC-orange for the Nano X, and matte-black and BTC-orange for the Nano S Plus excluded from the promotion. Should You Buy the Ledger Wallet? Nobody can answer that for you, but if you\u2019ve decided that the Ledger wallet meets your expectations in terms of security, style, and ease of use, and you want to buy it, buy it today. Or, at the very least, until July 15, when the current 30% promotion ends, because discounts like these don\u2019t come often. Also, go to Ledger\u2019s website and scroll through their offers. You\u2019ll find a lot of products and accessories, based on your needs. Remember, this is not financial advice. Do your own research before buying any product."

Market Reaction Follows Viral Meme Meme tokens often depend on hype, and PNUT was no exception. After Musk\u2019s message spread, order books filled fast. Buy orders outnumbered sells, driving price momentum. Crypto bots and retail traders piled in, hoping to catch the wave.

Traders could face losses if views shift or if Musk moves on to the next joke. For now, Musk\u2019s satirical jab has put Peanut the Squirrel on center stage.
