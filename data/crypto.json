      "summary": "SUI has quickly become a standout performer in the crypto market, posting a dramatic 150% gain from $1.71 to $4.30. Yet, not all is smooth sailing. A $215 million token unlock on June 1, 2025, threatens to introduce major selling pressure. Volatility Meets Opportunity: SUI Charts A Risk-Reward Path According to SirRichard\u2019s latest update on X, SUI has exhibited notable price swings, but its long-term outlook remains firmly bullish. The token recently pulled off a remarkable 150% rally, climbing from a low of $1.71 to a high of $4.30. This explosive move caught the attention of traders, especially as it coincided with a golden cross formation on the daily chart, a classic technical signal that often precedes major bullish continuation. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View Based on this setup, SirRichard believes SUI could be preparing for an even more significant leg up, potentially targeting new highs around the $7.56 mark. If this plays out, it would represent a staggering 380% gain from earlier levels. However, he also warned that the journey may not be without obstacles, particularly as other technical and fundamental signals begin to surface. A recent bearish crossover in the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) may hinder SUI\u2019s bullish momentum in the short term. Additionally, the token unlock on June 1, 2025, resulting in the release of approximately $215 million worth of SUI into circulation, poses a potential risk. Such a large supply event could introduce selling pressure and spark short-term volatility if not absorbed smoothly by the market. Currently, immediate support lies between $3.40 and $3.43, which could act as a cushion in the event of a dip. On the upside, resistance is building around the $3.50\u2013$4.00 zone. A firm break above this level would reignite bullish momentum, paving the way for SUI\u2019s next upward surge. Bearish Winds Loom, But On-Chain Strength Holds Ground On the other hand, if bearish sentiment intensifies, the price could fall toward the $2.33 level, a key support that could be tested. Such a move would likely challenge bullish confidence and introduce volatility in the near term. Related Reading: Here\u2019s Why SUI At $3.61 Could Be the Calm Before A Parabolic Surge Despite this, the broader outlook is supported by impressive network activity. SUI\u2019s ecosystem has seen over $40 billion in aggregator volume, a significant metric pointing to strong participation and interest. Even more encouraging is the 24% increase in activity over the last 30 days, highlighting a growing user base and rising utility. These fundamentals serve as a strong counterbalance to short-term risks. If sustained, they could provide a firm foundation for renewed bullish momentum. As such, any price dip may offer a fresh opportunity for long-term investors. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin is once again knocking on the door of price discovery, but researchers at Bitwise Asset Management argue that spot quotations still understate what the network is worth. In their Week 24 Crypto Market Compass circulated late Tuesday, Dr. Andr\u00e9 Dragosch, Bitwise\u2019s Head of Research for Europe, and analyst Ayush Tripathi calculate that \u201cquantitative models estimate Bitcoin\u2019s hypothetical \u2018fair value\u2019 amid the current sovereign default probabilities at around $230,000 today.\u201d The figure implies a premium of just over 110 percent to the market price, which was hovering near $109,600 at press time on 11 June 2025. Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018True Worth\u2019 Is Explosive Dragosch ties that assessment to the rally in sovereign-risk hedges. United-States one-year credit-default-swap spreads are trading near half-percentage-point territory\u2014levels last seen during the 2023 debt-ceiling scare\u2014reflecting \u201cbroader concerns over the US fiscal deficit,\u201d Reuters reported last week. \u201cBitcoin can provide an alternative \u2018portfolio insurance\u2019 against widespread sovereign defaults as a scarce, decentralised asset which is free of counterparty risks,\u201d the note argues, adding that net interest outlays projected by the Congressional Budget Office point to a tripling of US debt-service costs to roughly $3 trillion by 2030.

The firm\u2019s in-house Cryptoasset Sentiment Index shows twelve of fifteen market-breadth gauges trending higher, while the cross-asset risk-appetite index (CARA) compiled from equities, credit, rates and commodities has surged to a five-year high. \u201cBoth cryptoasset and cross-asset sentiment are now decisively bullish,\u201d Dragosch writes, noting that Bitcoin\u2019s climb back above $110,000 places it within two percent of the all-time high near $112,000 set in May. On-chain data remain constructive. Exchange reserves have slipped to 2.91 million BTC\u2014about 14.6 percent of the circulating supply\u2014after whales withdrew an estimated 390,632 BTC last week. At the same time, net exchange-spot outflows slowed to roughly $0.53 billion from $1.78 billion the previous week, suggesting lighter profit-taking pressure. Derivative positioning echoes the spot-market resilience. Aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest added 2,200 BTC across venues, while the CME leg gained 6.4 k BTC. Funding rates on perpetual swaps stayed positive overall despite flipping negative for parts of the weekend, and the three-month annualised basis held around 6.3 percent. In options, open interest expanded by 27,300 BTC, with the put-to-call ratio settling at 0.55; one-month 25-delta skew remained modestly negative, implying continued demand for downside hedges even as realised volatility slipped to 28.2 percent. Institutional flows are reinforcing the bullish tone. Global crypto ETPs absorbed $488.5 million last week, of which $254.9 million went into Bitcoin products. US spot Bitcoin ETFs led the charge with $525 million of inflows, counterbalanced by a $24.1 million weekly leak from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Bitwise\u2019s own BITB vehicle attracted $78.1 million, while its European physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE) saw only marginal outflows. Ethereum products also enjoyed $260.9 million in net inflows, maintaining the broad-based risk bid. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Diverge\u2014ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative Bitwise concedes that headline risk can still provoke sharp, short-lived drawdowns\u2014last week\u2019s spat between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump briefly drove BTC back to $100,000\u2014but sees structural forces firmly tilted to the upside. \u201cUS economic policy uncertainty has most likely passed its zenith already and continues to decline at the margin,\u201d Dragosch writes, pointing to May non-farm-payroll growth of 139,000 and a moderation in recession odds. With Bitcoin already outperforming traditional assets year-to-date and cross-asset sentiment now confirmed by Bitwise\u2019s indicators, the analysts argue that the market is beginning to price the asset less as a speculative vehicle and more as a macro hedge. Whether traders embrace the $230,000 fair-value marker hinges on the same variables underscored in the note\u2014sovereign-risk premiums, policy uncertainty and the pace of institutional adoption\u2014but the groundwork, they say, is visible on-chain, on desks and in the flow data. \u201cBitcoin also reclaimed 110k USD and is close to its previous all-time high,\u201d the report reminds readers. For Bitwise, that proximity is not an end point but a staging area: the monetary asset\u2019s intrinsic value, they conclude, resides \u201cconsiderably further north.\u201d At press time, BTC traded at $109,617. &#160; Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "title": "Bitcoin Price Break Above $107,000 Triggers Bullishness, These Factors Will Drive A Faster Rise",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-107000-triggers-bulls/",
      "summary": "After days of testing a resistance zone at $106,000, Bitcoin has finally broken above the $107,000 mark to confirm a strong bullish momentum that has been building since early June. The breakout, which has seen Bitcoin reclaim $110,000 briefly in the past 24 hours, follows several failed attempts to close above this pivotal level. Technical analysis of the Bitcoin price indicates that the breakout above $107,000 has given bulls back control. Particularly, technical analysis from crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s price will accelerate for the rest of the week. $106,500 Confirms Strength, Analyst Eye Accelerated Move Over the past few days, Bitcoin\u2019s price structure has been forming a rounded base with higher lows, gradually coiling under a support turned resistance. Now that the breakout has occurred, bulls seem to be back in control. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here According to Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a widely-followed crypto analyst on the social media platform X, the decisive moment came after Bitcoin cleared the $106,500 resistance, a level he previously mentioned he&#8217;s looking at. In his post, he noted that as long as Bitcoin maintains support above this zone, momentum will continue to shift in favor of buyers. Specifically, he pointed out that day traders are likely to pile in with new long positions, while short sellers are either closing their positions or getting squeezed out entirely. Both of these actions will continue to generate buying pressure, at least in the short term. This shift in market structure has already begun to play out. As the chart below shows, the previous resistance zone around $107,000, which was a strong support during the earlier ATH moves in May, has now flipped. This zone had repeatedly rejected price advances, acting as a price ceiling since May 30. Now, with the breakout confirmed and volume increasing, the analyst expects a swift rally toward $108,900 and beyond for the rest of the week. Bulls Prepare For New Bitcoin All-Time High The timing of this breakout also coincides with the start of the trading week, which Van de Poppe describes as a great start to the week and a continued upside for the remainder of the week. More often than not in this cycle, Bitcoin has exhibited sentiment surges early in the week that persisted throughout the week. If Bitcoin can consolidate above the $107,000 to $108,000 range without falling back into the previous structure, it could enter a new price zone as soon as the $111,000 barrier is breached.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,455, having recently reached an intraday high of $110,237. The leading cryptocurrency is currently only about 2.5% away from setting a new all-time high. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-1-million-michael-saylor-laughs-off-crypto-winter-fears/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s price outlook remains sky-high after Strategy founder Michael Saylor told Bloomberg on Tuesday that a market freeze won\u2019t come back. He argued that growing demand and limited daily supply point straight to a rally toward $1 million. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Supply And Demand Pressure According to Saylor, miners release only about 450 BTC each day. That adds up to roughly $50 million at today\u2019s price of around $109,859. He said once that $50 million is snapped up by buyers, there\u2019s no choice but for the price to climb. His view rests on the idea that active demand now matches or exceeds what miners sell. High Price Targets Based on reports, asset manager ARK Invest recently boosted its bull case for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. Saylor went even further. He said that as long as Bitcoin doesn\u2019t head to zero, it\u2019s bound for $1 million. His own firm has picked up 582,000 BTC since 2020. That stash is worth nearly $64 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. Institutional And Political Support Saylor pointed to big names backing Bitcoin. He mentioned US President Donald Trump, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC chair Paul Atkins as signs that the asset has won its toughest battles. He also noted that banks are lining up to offer custody services. And he praised Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and others for buying coins daily. Volatility Warning Saylor didn\u2019t shy away from a cautionary note. He suggested that if Bitcoin hits $500,000 or $1 million, a fall to about $200,000 could follow. That\u2019s almost a 60% drop from the peak. His point was that big price swings are part of Bitcoin\u2019s history\u2014and likely its future. Beyond miner sales and whale wallets, analysts say wider market moves matter too. Spot and futures trading often top $10 billion a day, so $50 million of fresh buys might only nudge the price. Regulation could swing the other way if concerns over energy use or consumer protection grow. And rival cryptocurrencies keep popping up with new features. Related Reading: Owning 10,000 XRP? You\u2019re Among Crypto\u2019s Elite, Expert Claims What Comes Next Reports disclose the real test will be whether steady new buyers can outpace both miner supply and selling by holders looking to bank profits. Saylor\u2019s figures make a strong case for continued upside. But investors who build a plan around a $1 million Bitcoin should brace for big dips along the way. In the end, daily demand, political moves and how the rest of the financial world reacts will decide if those eye-popping targets really come to pass.
