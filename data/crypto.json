      "summary": "Trump Media &#38; Technology Group (TMTG) quietly lodged an S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission late on July 8, seeking approval for the \u201cTruth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.\u201d Despite a swirl of social-media posts placing the paperwork in early June, the SEC\u2019s time-stamp confirms the filing date as July 8. The prospectus sketches a five-coin portfolio weighted approximately 70 percent to bitcoin, 15 percent to ether, 8 percent to solana, 5 percent to Cronos and 2 percent to XRP, making it the first Trump-branded product to diversify beyond the two largest digital assets. The trust, structured as a Nevada business trust and sponsored by boutique issuer Yorkville America Digital, aims to list its shares on NYSE Arca. Foris DAX Trust \u2014 the US institutional arm of Crypto.com \u2014 is named digital-asset custodian, while authorized participants will create and redeem blocks of 10,000 shares in kind or for cash, subject to NYSE rule changes. The prospectus also discloses that staking rewards on ether, solana and cronos may be passed through to the fund, a design choice that would set a precedent among US spot-crypto ETFs. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why XRP Stands To Gain Big From Ripple\u2019s RLUSD Analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg distilled the filing in two succinct posts on X: \u201cNew filing for the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, which will be a spot crypto basket holding Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP and Cronos,\u201d he wrote; in a follow-up, he reproduced the pivotal language: \u201cthe Trust\u2019s allocation\u2026 is initially expected to approximate 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP.\u201d Those percentages now serve as the market\u2019s working model for how the Trump universe ranks crypto\u2019s \u2018blue chips.\u2019 Why Solana, Cronos And XRP? Overall, the allocation may serve as an implicit ranking of the top five crypto assets as viewed through the lens of Trump\u2019s inner circle. Binance top trader by PnL Nachi (@alphawifhat) commented via X: \u201cI think it&#8217;s useful to look at the allocation ratio of the Truth Social Crypto ETF [&#8230;] I see this as an indication of how Trump&#8217;s crypto team looks at the top crypto assets and what are the top 5 they want to value the most. This could be a catalyst to pump CRO as it&#8217;s a dark horse.\u201d Solana\u2019s climb to an 8 percent weight is more than a momentum trade. CME Group this spring announced cash-settled Solana futures pending CFTC sign-off, extending the same institutional rails that helped bitcoin and ether graduate into ETF form. Notably, the SEC has set a July deadline for spot Solana ETF refilings, indicating a potential approval before the October 2 deadline. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Cronos leaps over better-capitalized tokens because Crypto.com is literally powering Trump\u2019s ETFs. \u201cWe are proud to partner with Trump Media and Yorkville\u2026 including the first-of-its-kind basket of tokens featuring CRO,\u201d Crypto.com co-founder Kris Marszalek said in March when the multi-year, roughly $2.7 billion partnership was unveiled. Under the agreement, Crypto.com supplies custody, liquidity and back-end order routing for all Truth-branded funds. XRP brings up the rear at two percent, reflecting both its renewed legitimacy and its still-nascent institutional plumbing. On June 27, Ripple Labs announced that it will withdraw its cross appeal against the SEC. The token\u2019s modest two-percent slice is politicized as much as it is financial. In early March a staffer from Ballard Partners\u2014the K-Street shop that counts Ripple as a client\u2014slipped Donald Trump draft language for a Truth Social post urging that XRP, Solana and Cardano be placed in a national \u201cCrypto Strategic Reserve.\u201d Trump hit \u201cpost\u201d and only later discovered the Ripple connection; insiders told Politico he \u201cwas furious and felt like he\u2019d been used.\u201d Despite that, the inclusion of XRP still shows Trump\u2019s ties with Ripple.

      "summary": "Tether Holdings, the issuer of the market\u2019s largest stablecoin, USDT, has revealed that it maintains a vault in Switzerland to safeguard an impressive $8 billion stockpile of gold. According to Bloomberg, the firm&#8217;s significant reserve of nearly 80 tons positions Tether as one of the largest gold holders globally, surpassed only by central banks and sovereign nations with the company based in El Salvador expressing intentions to expand its gold reserves further. Tether Reveals 5% Of Reserves In Precious Metals In a recent interview, Tether&#8217;s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the security of their vault, claiming it to be among the most secure facilities worldwide. While he confirmed the vault\u2019s location in Switzerland, he opted not to disclose its exact whereabouts, citing security concerns. Related Reading: PEPE Traders Spot Breakout Echo\u2014Explosive Surge Back On The Table? Tether is best known for its stablecoin, USDT, which aims to maintain a one-to-one value with the US dollar. According to CoinMarketCap data, USDT dominates the stablecoin market with a capitalization of $158 billion. Circle\u2019s USDC follows closely behind with a capitalization of $61 billion. However, both companies are expected to see a major surge in this metric as the recently approved US Senate stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, aims to provide issuers with a new regulatory framework that could further boost adoption and usage of the assets by traditional financial companies. The company also generates revenue by exchanging dollars for USDT tokens and investing the collateral in various assets, including US Treasuries. According to Tether&#8217;s latest financial report, precious metals now account for nearly 5% of the company\u2019s reserves. Benefits Of The Gold-Backed XAUT Token In addition to USDT, Tether has introduced a gold-backed token known as XAUT, with each token representing one ounce of gold. Token holders have the option to redeem their XAUT for physical gold, which can be collected directly from the Swiss vault. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In Ardoino articulated a growing belief in gold as a safer asset compared to national currencies, particularly in light of rising concerns over the increasing debt levels in the United States. He noted that as these concerns grow, investors may seek alternatives, such as gold. The firm\u2019s CEO further highlighted that every central bank within the BRICS nations is actively purchasing gold, which he believes has contributed to the rising price of the precious metal. Per the report, the decision to establish Tether&#8217;s own vault rather than relying on traditional precious metals vault operators was primarily influenced by cost considerations. As of press time, Circle\u2019s newly launched stock, CRCL, has closed the trading day at $204, approximately a 31% gap between current valuations and their record price of $298.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/analyst-predicts-2000-cardano-rally/",
      "summary": "Crypto-market commentator \u201cQuantum Ascend\u201d devoted a 8 June video to a single idea: the price structure that once catapulted Ethereum Classic to its bull-market peak is about to do the same for Cardano\u2014and could deliver a twenty-fold advance if history \u201crhymes rather than repeats.\u201d Speaking to his followers, the analyst opened by noting that ADA\u2019s weekly chart \u201clooks so similar\u201d to the multi-year pattern that preceded Ethereum Classic\u2019s vertical move in early 2021. \u201cThey have the same market makers,\u201d he asserted, pointing out that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson had early involvement in both projects. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a cheat code for this thing.\u201d Cardano Set For 2,000% Explosion To illustrate the parallel, Quantum Ascend overlaid the two assets\u2019 Elliott-wave counts. In his reading, Ethereum Classic completed its fifth impulsive wave during the last cycle, whereas Cardano is \u201cwaiting on that fifth wave\u201d after a prolonged flag-shaped consolidation. He then dropped a Fibonacci retracement on Ethereum Classic\u2019s 2020\u201321 third-to-fourth-wave segment, showing the final thrust topped out \u201cjust shy of the 2.36\u201d\u2014and repeated the exercise on Cardano\u2019s current structure, which has advanced to the same proportional level. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut you guys see how similar these structures are.\u201d A second Fibonacci projection, stretching Cardano\u2019s initial three-wave span to a full 1.618 extension, points to a conservative target \u201cup around four bucks,\u201d he said. But a more ambitious extrapolation of Ethereum Classic\u2019s 3.618 climax would propel ADA into a zone between roughly 10.67 and 12.55\u2014an area he calls his \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d objectives. From the current price such a run would exceed 2,000 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s violent,\u201d he remarked after flicking his cursor to the comparative surge on the ETC chart. \u201cHopefully you can see how clean this is, because I feel really good about Cardano getting up into that $10 level.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Turns Upward \u2014 Signs of a Recovery Emerge Quantum Ascend argued that the temporal spacing is also lining up. Ethereum Classic\u2019s listing in August 2016 meant its multiyear base completed roughly four and a half years later; Cardano\u2019s analogous base, begun in late 2017, is now of similar duration, though \u201cthe whole chart has taken a little bit longer on the consolidation.\u201d For him, that extension merely \u201cloads the spring\u201d for a sharper repricing once last season begins in earnest. The analyst did allow for interim turbulence. In his scenario, ADA could hit the former all-time-high region around $3.12, \u201creject back down to $1.67\u201d during a broader market-wide wave-four shake-out, and only then launch into a blow-off toward the upper Fibonacci cluster. Still, even that corrective loop reinforces the fractal: \u201cOver here with Ethereum Classic it got to its last all-time high, rejected, and then went on one more big run.\u201d Related Reading: Cardano Price Woes To Continue? Analyst Expects ADA To Fall To $0.47 Quantifying his own risk appetite, Quantum Ascend told viewers he is \u201cpretty hyped on Cardano\u201d and wants the token \u201cin my portfolio because it is one of my higher-conviction plays for what\u2019s about to happen here.\u201d He concluded by sketching three tiers of price objectives\u2014$4.90 (conservative), $10.67 (primary) and $12.45 (secondary). Whether altseason\u2019s starting gun fires as cleanly as the fractal implies remains to be seen, but Quantum Ascend\u2019s thesis hinges on a single proposition: when the same market makers move two historically linked assets through mirror-image patterns, ignoring the setup may prove costlier than betting against it.

      "title": "Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here?",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-outperforming-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "With one week already gone in the month of July, Ethereum has already begun to perform better than Bitcoin. While the gap is still very close, the outperformance of Ethereum over Bitcoin for only the second time this year could signal the entrance of better things for the altcoin market. If this continues, then an altcoin season might be on the horizon, as historical data shows it always begins with ETH outperforming BTC. So, let\u2019s take a look at how both assets have been performing. Ethereum Barrels Ahead Of Bitcoin In July So far, in the month of July, the Ethereum price has been putting in more green candles, suggesting that bulls are making their move again. This has led to a small outperformance when compared to the Bitcoin price over this time period and could be the signal that altcoin season could be starting soon. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could See 180% Explosion As This Indicator Flashes Bullish Divergence Data from the CryptoRank website shows that Ethereum is already up more than 2.50% since the start of July. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price, while having seen some price increases, is up only 1.20% at the time of this writing. Thus, Ethereum is already performing better in the month of July. If this outperformance continues, then this would be only the second time that the Ethereum price will be doing better than the Bitcoin price so far in 2025. The first was back in May, when the Ethereum price rallied by over 41% in one month. This was major compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 11.1% move in that month. However, while the Bitcoin rally in the month of May saw its price reach new all-time highs, Ethereum continues to struggle and remains below its $4,800 all-time high levels. Nevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s rally did translate to bullishness for the altcoin market as the likes of PEPE and BONK rallied by more than 100% in response to this. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here\u2019s The Target Given that Ethereum has led the altcoin season in the past, its outperformance of Bitcoin at this level remains a positive. If it continues, then the altcoin market could start to see further increases in price. And if Ethereum rises another 41% from here, it would put it right on the path to $4,000. However, the month of July has not historically been the best month for Ethereum, with an average return of +5.13%. The whole of the third quarter of the year is also a mixed bag for the altcoin, with an equal number of green and red closes over the last decade. Thus, it remains to be seen how the ETH price will perform this quarter and if it can successfully outpace Bitcoin. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "As the crypto market moves sideways, Solana (SOL) compresses between two key levels. Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is about to break out and reclaim a crucial resistance level, which could trigger the long-awaited retest of the $200 barrier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back In \u2018Retesting Phase\u2019 After Key Level Reclaim \u2013 The Calm Before The Storm? Solana Holds Key Support After recovering from last month\u2019s downtrend, Solana has been attempting to reclaim the crucial $160 level to continue its bullish rally. The cryptocurrency traded between the $140-$180 range for two months, but briefly lost its post-breakout range in late June. Two weeks ago, SOL fell below the $130 area, hitting a two-month low of $126 on June 22. Since then, the altcoin has recovered, fueled by last week\u2019s launch of a Solana staked crypto Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US by Rex Shares. Following the news, Solana\u2019s price jumped toward the $160 resistance level but was rejected, hovering between the $145-$155 price range for the past week. On Tuesday, SOL fell below the $150 level, hitting the $147 support before bouncing. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that the $147.59 area is one of the most important support levels for Solana, as losing this level could trigger a pullback to the next key zone around the $141 mark. Similarly, market watcher Man of Bitcoin affirmed that SOL\u2019s key support to maintain is around $141.91, adding that \u201ca sustained break below this level would suggest that wave-C of (ii) is already underway.\u201d The analyst previously warned that there is a potential scenario \u201cwith one more low in wave-5,\u201d if the cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t hold about the $148 mark. However, maintaining this support would build a base to target the local highs. SOL About To Retest $160? Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show affirmed that SOL is \u201cabout to break off\u201d a triangle formation and test the $162 resistance. As the price compresses between the upper and lower boundaries, the analyst suggested that the cryptocurrency\u2019s breakout is around the corner. Notably, Solana has been forming a one-week symmetrical triangle pattern in the daily chart. If the cryptocurrency successfully breaks above the $152-$153 zone, it could see a 10.87% jump toward the technical target of $167. The Cryptonomist highlighted that SOL broke out of a multi-day diagonal resistance on Sunday, which was retested and confirmed as support after bouncing around the $147 twice since the breakout. Related Reading: 50% Bitcoin Price Crash On The Horizon? Analyst Reveals $60,000 Target The analyst considers that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a continuation of its rally, targeting the one-week high and resistance of $160. Meanwhile, Crypto Jelle noted that despite the April downside deviation, Solana continues to trade within its $125-$180 Macro Range, currently hovering around the mid-range. To him, \u201cit looks like it&#8217;s just waiting for BTC to break out. Once it reclaims $160, $200 should come quickly. Above there, new all-time highs are within reach.\u201d As of this writing, Solana is trading at $151.51, a 3.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.
