      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-network-is-heating-up-while-price-stalls-is-a-breakout-coming/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is currently trading in a period of subdued price movement, reflecting broader consolidation across the crypto asset market. At the time of writing, ETH is trading around $2,423, marking a slight 0.9% daily decrease and standing more than 50% below its all-time high of $4,878. This stagnation has coincided with a broader lack of catalysts to drive a sustained rally, leaving traders cautious about Ethereum&#8217;s near-term trajectory. Despite this lack of price momentum, network activity on Ethereum tells a different story. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level \u2013 Bullish Continuation In Focus Ethereum On-Chain Metrics Point to Increased Network Engagement According to CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alem\u00e1n, the number of confirmed transactions on the Ethereum network recently spiked to 1,750,940, making it the third-highest daily transaction count in its history. Alem\u00e1n notes this trend may signal underlying usage strength, even as market participants wait for a more significant price response. Alem\u00e1n\u2019s analysis focuses on Ethereum\u2019s \u201cTransaction Count (Total)\u201d metric, which captures all forms of activity, including ETH transfers, smart contract executions, and interactions with decentralized applications and DeFi protocols. The recent surge reverses a months-long downtrend and represents the highest transaction count since January 14, when Ethereum recorded 1.96 million transactions. According to Alem\u00e1n, this spike may be driven by increased arbitrage, trading activity, and interactions with Layer 2 networks, which continue to absorb substantial transaction volume. Platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism remain key contributors to Ethereum\u2019s broader usage. He further points out that, despite ETH price volatility within the $2,100\u2013$2,880 range in recent weeks, the uptick in network traffic may hint at early-stage accumulation or renewed DeFi interest. This dynamic, while not immediately reflected in the asset\u2019s valuation, suggests that Ethereum\u2019s core infrastructure continues to see meaningful use. Speculative Behavior and Exchange Flows Raise Short-Term Concerns Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst, Amr Taha, has examined Ethereum\u2019s recent technical setup from a derivatives market perspective. Taha highlights that ETH funding rates on Binance have shifted from negative to positive territory, a sign that leveraged long positions are building, which may reflect expectations of continued price upside. However, this shift also raises the potential for overextension, particularly if longs begin to dominate positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears \u2013 Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout Taha also references a recent retest of a key short-squeeze zone, during which market participants who had shorted ETH were forced to close positions, triggering rapid buy orders. Such moves can generate short-term surges, but they\u2019re often followed by correction phases once speculative energy fades. Meanwhile, exchange data showed more than 177,000 ETH deposited on Binance over three days, indicating potential sell pressure or repositioning by large holders.

      "summary": "Bitcoin is treading cautiously below the $110,000 level, signaling a pause in momentum after recent highs. At the time of writing, the asset is priced at $106,841, marking a mild 0.4% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite brushing a daily high of $107,884, BTC appears to be consolidating in a narrow range, with market participants watching for the next significant move. Amid this relatively flat price action, on-chain trends suggest that not all is quiet under the surface. A new analysis by CryptoQuant contributor \u201coinonen\u201d sheds light on wallet activity within Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction Bitcoin Mid-Tier Investors Take Center Stage on Binance Oinonen&#8217;s findings point to a sharp increase in whale-level participation, as well as a notable contribution from mid-tier investors, which could have implications for broader market behavior. Citing CryptoQuant\u2019s on-chain metrics, the analyst revealed that Binance\u2019s inflow data shows that wallets depositing between 10 and 100 BTC now account for 40% of all Bitcoin inflows. These wallet sizes typically belong to high-net-worth individuals, trading firms, or mid-sized institutions\u2014those who sit between retail traders and deep-pocketed whales. In contrast, whale-level inflows (100\u20131,000 BTC) currently represent 20% of the total, highlighting that mid-tier players may be driving more exchange activity than larger whales at this time. Interestingly, whale activity still made a major appearance recently. On June 16, inflows of 10,000 BTC surged and made up 83% of total exchange inflows on Binance that day, reinforcing earlier observations from Oinonen about increased whale presence over the past year. According to CryptoQuant\u2019s whale ratio metric, that presence has reportedly jumped by as much as 400% since mid-2023. Binance Deposit Data Points to Rising Institutional Interest Beyond just inflow ratios, Binance\u2019s overall deposit metrics suggest a growing trend of larger average deposits. The average Bitcoin deposit rose from 0.36 BTC in 2023 to 1.65 BTC in 2024. The exchange processed $21.6 billion in user fund deposits in 2024, roughly 40% more than the combined totals of the next ten crypto exchanges. Despite the growing institutional footprint, the significant portion of deposits in the 10\u2013100 BTC range shows that mid-level market participants remain active contributors to the trading ecosystem. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer This data may reflect a broader shift in how BTC is being accumulated and moved, where influence is shared between whales and mid-sized investors. While whale flows often generate headlines, the consistent presence of mid-tier wallets can signal healthier market participation and a more distributed form of liquidity provision across the board. With Bitcoin still consolidating near key price levels, these on-chain trends could help shape its next breakout, whenever it comes. Featured image created with DALL-E. Chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-reclaims-2500-in-squeeze-driven-rally-but-can-it-hold/",
      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) has recorded strong gains over the past two weeks, rising from $2,111 on June 12 to $2,515 on June 25, reigniting hopes for a sustained bullish rally that could push the digital asset beyond the crucial $3,000 level. Ethereum Rally Marked By Shift In Dynamics According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Ethereum\u2019s latest rally has been accompanied by a notable shift in market dynamics &#8211; including a flip to positive funding rates, a potential short squeeze, and a rise in ETH inflows to Binance crypto exchange. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge Recent data from Binance reveals a significant shift in ETH funding rates from negative to positive. Positive funding rates typically indicate that traders are opening or holding leveraged long positions, reflecting expectations of further upside. However, rising funding rates may also raise the risk of a short-term price pullback if long positions become overextended. Data from CoinGlass shows that 68.15% of liquidations over the past 24 hours were long positions &#8211; highlighting this risk. Taha also emphasized the role of a short squeeze in Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge and the increase in funding rates. As ETH&#8217;s price climbed, it retested the previous short-squeeze zone around $2,500. He explained: In that earlier event, short positions were forcibly closed by initiating aggressive market buy orders to cover their exposure, triggering a cascading effect known as a short squeeze. This dynamic occurs when traders who had bet against ETH (shorts) are forced to close their positions by aggressively buying back the asset to limit losses. Meanwhile, ETH inflows to Binance have also spiked. On-chain exchange data suggests that 177,000 ETH was deposited into Binance over a three-day period &#8211; an unusually high volume. Such a surge typically signals increased selling pressure or large-scale repositioning by major holders. Large transfers of ETH to exchanges often precede either potential sell-offs or liquidity provisioning. In conclusion, Taha noted that while a short-term correction may be likely, ETH\u2019s breakout above $2,500 underscores the aggressive speculative activity driving its recent price action. Traders are advised to closely monitor funding rates and exchange flows for signs of an impending retracement. ETH Bulls Take The Charge Recent technical analysis suggests ETH may be gearing up for a breakout above the $2,800 resistance level. The asset also recently formed a golden cross on the daily chart, fuelling speculation that a new all-time high (ATH) could be within reach. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Wake Up: $4,000 Target Back on the Radar After Reclaiming Key Level That said, ETH is not entirely in the clear.

      "summary": "A federal judge has rejected Ripple and the SEC&#8217;s proposed $50 million settlement, but social media sentiment around XRP has turned bullish anyway. Ripple-SEC Settlement Stalled After Court Rejection The Ripple-SEC case seemed to be moving forward after both parties agreed on a reduced $50 million settlement, but the joint motion for an indicative ruling has now been rejected in court. According to the filing shared by defense lawyer James K. Filian in an X post, the two haven&#8217;t &#8220;come close&#8221; to showing exceptional circumstances outweighing public interest or the administration of justice that would justify modifying the judgment. This means that the original fine of $125 million still stands for Ripple. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Shoots Up: Warning For BTC? Following the news, XRP has taken a bearish hit to its price, as the below chart displays. The asset was trading around $2.15 at the time the news broke out, but it has since fallen below $2.09, implying a decrease of around 3%. Naturally, this reaction is quite mild by the cryptocurrency sector&#8217;s standards, but could still suggest some panic selling. Sentiment among the retail crowd, however, has seen a surprising jump, as per social media data. XRP Sentiment On Social Media Has Seen A Bullish Jump In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the social media users have responded to news of the Ripple-SEC case stalling. The indicator shared by Santiment is the &#8220;Positive/Negative Sentiment,&#8221; gauging the ratio between positive and negative comments involving a given coin on the major social media platforms. The indicator separates between positive and negative posts/threads/messages on the platforms using a machine-learning model and determines how the counts of the two compare. Here is a chart that shows the latest trend in the metric for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP: As displayed in the above graph, the Positive/Negative Sentiment is currently above the 1 mark for all three of these cryptocurrencies, indicating that posts pertaining to bullish sentiment outweigh the bearish ones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction For Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, the positive comments only have a slight advantage, meaning that while optimism does exist among the crowd, it&#8217;s quite mild. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that XRP has diverged from these assets with a sharp spike, which has taken its Positive/Negative Sentiment to a value of 2.1. This is the highest level for the cryptocurrency in 17 days and corresponds to there being more than double as many bullish calls as bearish ones. Often, retail sentiment acts as a contrarian signal, with extreme values in either direction leading to some sort of reversal in the price. As such, while this development in crowd mentality could potentially imply investors aren&#8217;t worried about the news, the indicator could still be to keep an eye on.
