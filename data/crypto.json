      "summary": "Ethereum (ETH) grabbed fresh attention on June 16 as futures open interest climbed to a yearly high of $36.56 billion. Prices bounced back above $2,600 and hovered near a key resistance level that has held for months. Traders piled into new positions, setting the stage for a big move in either direction. Related Reading: Amid Bitcoin Hype, Seasoned Trader Predicts Sudden Drop To This Level Futures Open Interest Hits Yearly High According to CoinGlass data, open interest in ETH futures jumped sharply over three days, hitting $36.56 billion on Monday. That number marks the highest level since last year. It shows that many traders are using borrowed funds to bet on where Ethereum will go next. Price Tests Multi\u2011Year Resistance ETH rose about 4.5% in a single session. Based on technical charts, that rally pushed ETH right up to a long\u2011standing descending trendline. Investors have watched that line for over a year. It sits just above the 50\u2011week moving average, while the 200\u2011week average lies just below. If ETH can clear and hold above these levels, it may signal room to run. But weak trading volume could mean bulls need more firepower before taking charge. ETF Flows Show Steady Support US spot funds tied to Ethereum saw a small outflow of $2.18 million on the same day, marking the first net withdrawal in 19 days. Yet weekly inflows still totaled $528.12 million, pushing total assets under management in these ETFs beyond $10 billion. Institutional Backing Expands ETH Reach Major asset managers are also getting more creative with Ethereum. Companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity have begun rolling out tokenized treasury products and stablecoin\u2011backed funds that link directly to ETH. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Feast While Retail Flees\u2014ETH Ocean Just Got Hungrier Based on statements by those firms, these latest products are intended to expand access for large institutions that have avoided so far. They support the notion that Ethereum is not only capable of fueling DeFi tests, but also applications in the real world. Ethereum Drift Remains Steady Before Potential Ripples Meanwhile, market statistics shows Ethereum traded calmly at $2,630 on June 16, showing a 4% increase in the last 24 hours. Futures markets are warming up, with volumes rising steeply as large players pour into ETH-based contracts. Speculative positions usually foretell choppy action. As increasing amounts of money move into leveraged positions, even modest moves in price can cause forced liquidations\u2014sometimes on both the long and short sides. When that occurs, volatility increases. That is to say, today&#8217;s tranquil chart can become jagged quickly once those mammoth bets begin to be unravel.

      "summary": "Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s European research arm argues that the sharp sell-off that followed last week\u2019s military escalation between Iran and Israel is likely to give way to a powerful relief rally in Bitcoin, echoing the cryptocurrency\u2019s behaviour after earlier geopolitical shocks. In its 16 June weekly newsletter Bitwise Europe points to a \u201cChart of the Week\u201d that lines up the twenty most significant geopolitical risk events since July 2010 and finds that, on average, Bitcoin was \u201cup 31.2 percent fifty days after the event, with a median gain of 10.2 percent.\u201d According to the authors, \u201cmajor geopolitical risk events tend to be good buying opportunities for bitcoin and other crypto assets.\u201d The firm\u2019s in-house Crypto Asset Sentiment Index briefly turned negative on Friday\u2014its first dip below zero since May\u2014but had already swung back into slightly bullish territory by Monday morning, a shift Bitwise attributes to renewed inflows into spot exchange-traded products and continued US-dollar weakness. At Bitcoin\u2019s current price of around $107,000, a 31% rally would bring it to approximately $140,000. Missiles Fly, Bitcoin To $140,000? The historical analogue is being tested in real time as markets digest the first open exchange of missiles between Tehran and Jerusalem. The Associated Press reports that Iran has fired more than 370 projectiles at Israel since 13 June, killing at least twenty-four people, while Israel claims to have destroyed over 120 Iranian launchers and says it now enjoys \u201cfull aerial superiority over Tehran.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin 656% Cyclical Gain Highlights Deep Market Demand \u2013 Glassnode The confrontation triggered a textbook flight to safety: gold blasted through $3,430 an ounce on Friday, establishing a fresh record high, while Brent crude spiked and global equities lurched lower. Bitcoin, which had been flirting with its all-time peak near $111,000 early last week, sank as low as $102,600 during the first wave of air-strike headlines before rebounding to the $106,000\u2013107,000 zone. Even after that drawdown, Bitwise notes, the flagship cryptocurrency still out-performed the S&#38;P 500 on a weekly basis thanks to a late-week equity swoon. Bitwise\u2019s thesis rests on three pillars. First is behavioural: previous geopolitical shocks\u2014from Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea to the US\u2013Iran standoff of January 2020\u2014produced knee-jerk liquidations in risk assets, yet Bitcoin\u2019s selling pressure tended to exhaust quickly, setting the stage for a mean-reversion pop. Second is macroeconomic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Future Post Israel-Iran Event: On-Chain Analysis Disputes BTC\u2019s $50K Crash The firm highlights a \u201cpronounced depreciation of the US Dollar,\u201d as the DXY index slid to its weakest level since March 2022 following softer-than-expected inflation prints and another uptick in continuing unemployment claims. Fed-funds futures now imply 1.9 rate cuts by December 2025, loosening global financial conditions and historically favourable for non-yielding, dollar-denominated assets such as Bitcoin. Third is structural demand: US spot Bitcoin ETFs took in a net $1.37 billion last week, while corporate treasuries kept accumulating\u2014Strategy\u2019s Michael Saylor announced the acquisition of 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion today , and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet disclosed an additional 1,112 BTC purchase that brings its war chest to 10,000 coins. In derivatives, Bitwise flags that the put-call open-interest ratio on Bitcoin options ended the week at 0.61 after dipping to 0.55, while the one-month 25-delta skew flipped decisively into positive territory at +4.87 percent, indicating a premium for upside exposure despite realised volatility languishing around 30 percent. Funding rates on perpetual swaps also remained net long even during Thursday\u2019s risk-off purge, a pattern the firm interprets as \u201cbullish positioning or demand for topside hedging.\u201d Behind the scenes, whales withdrew a net 169,527 BTC from exchanges, and exchange-held reserves fell to 2.92 million coins\u2014about 14.6 percent of supply\u2014further tightening spot liquidity. Sceptics may note that past performance is not predictive and that the explosive rally following Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was fuelled in part by unprecedented monetary stimulus that may not be replicated. Bitwise itself concedes that realised losses spiked to $55.5 million on-chain last week and that momentum in \u201capparent demand\u201d has softened. Yet the firm argues that the confluence of structural inflows, dollar weakness and depressed sentiment mirrors the set-ups that preceded its historical sample of 31-percent rallies. As the newsletter concludes, \u201cstructural demand by both ETPs and corporate treasuries as well as continued macro tailwinds via Dollar weakness and global money supply expansion still support a positive market development for bitcoin and crypto assets.\u201d At press time, BTC traded at $107,239.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-must-hold-level-or-risk-30-price-crash/",
      "summary": "An analyst has explained how Dogecoin might have to hold strong above this level, if the memecoin has to avoid a 30% price drop. Dogecoin Is Currently Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart that shows where Dogecoin currently stands from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the graph in question, showing the trend in the 1-day price of the memecoin. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the Dogecoin price has possibly been trading inside a triangular channel during the last few months. The channel hasn&#8217;t appeared to be just any triangle-shaped one, either, but a special type called the Symmetrical Triangle. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls A Symmetrical Triangle forms whenever an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern tracks lower highs in the price, and the lower one higher lows. As the asset moves inside this channel, its range becomes narrower with time, until it shrinks down to a point at the apex. Generally, volatile moves are more likely to occur when consolidation tightens, so a breakout of the pattern becomes increasingly probable as the price approaches the tip of the triangle Symmetrical Triangle breakouts can signal a continuation of the trend in the direction of the break. This means that a rise above the pattern can be a bullish sign, while a drop below it may be a bearish one. As displayed in the chart, the 1-day price of Dogecoin has recently been nearing the end of the triangle, a potential sign that a breakout could be imminent. Currently, the memecoin is retesting the lower line, so it will be interesting to see whether the level holds or if this is where a break would finally happen. Unlike the Ascending and Descending Triangles, two other popular types of triangular channels in TA, breakouts are usually considered to be equally probable in either direction for a Symmetrical Triangle. The reason is simple: consolidation occurs in an exactly sideways manner in this pattern. In contrast, the Ascending and Descending types slope upward and downward, respectively, which can bias the breakout direction. Thus, even if Dogecoin is retesting the lower level right now, a rebound and then breakout from the upper line may also still be quite possible. That said, in the event that a bearish breakout does take place, things can be especially troubling for DOGE, as there is another level of importance just nearby.

      "summary": "As Bitcoin (BTC) reels amidst escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran &#8211; dropping from $110,530 on June 9 to just above $106,900 today &#8211; concerns are mounting that BTC\u2019s upward momentum may have stalled. However, on-chain data suggests that both Bitcoin whales and retail investors still anticipate further upside for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whale And Retail Inflows To Binance Tumble According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin inflows to Binance crypto exchange from two distinct cohorts &#8211; whales and retail investors &#8211; have fallen to their lowest levels in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum \u2018Highly Likely\u2019 To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows Darkfost shared the following chart illustrating that Bitcoin whale inflows to Binance have hit their lowest point since 2024. Similarly, retail investor inflows are also at their lowest since 2024, signalling a strong preference to hold rather than sell. The contributor emphasized that this alignment in behavior between whales and retail investors is a \u201chighly constructive signal for the market.\u201d Apart from the consistent inflows observed at the start of the current cycle, Darkfost identified two previous instances when both groups acted in sync. Notably, such periods of aligned behavior have typically coincided with previous market tops. These tops were marked by synchronized BTC inflows into exchanges, leading to a significant uptick in selling pressure and, eventually, market demand exhaustion. Commenting on the recent drop in BTC inflows, Darkfost suggested that market participants may be waiting for clearer macroeconomic cues or are simply exhibiting high conviction in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential. They added: Such alignment across investor classes may also reflect broader market confidence, with expectations of further profits ahead. Recent trading setups support the aforementioned outlook. In a separate X post, seasoned crypto analyst Ash Crypto highlighted that a Bitcoin whale had opened a massive $200 million long position with 20x leverage. Should BTC Holders Be Worried? Despite the encouraging dip in BTC inflows to major exchanges like Binance, some analysts warn that a deeper correction may be imminent. For example, TradingView analyst MIRZA recently predicted that BTC could fall as low as $85,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance \u2013 A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Similarly, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a cautionary note, that BTC may see a steep slide in the coming months. Brandt stated that if BTC mirrors the 2021-22 market cycle, then it may risk falling to as low as $23,600. That said, BTC outflows from exchanges continue to rise, depleting available reserves &#8211; a dynamic that could result in a supply shock. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $106,920, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant and TradingView.com"
