      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-2017-playbook-returns/",
      "summary": "The Ethereum price action is showing remarkable similarities to its 2017 market cycle, with analysts pointing to a near-identical technical setup and market behaviour. Crypto analyst Merlijn the Trader, who shared a side-by-side weekly chart comparison of 2025 and 2017 on X (formerly Twitter), suggests that Ethereum is now following the same breakout pattern that once led to a historic rally. This time, however, the analyst believes that the move could be even more significant. Ethereum Price Mirrors Historic Breakout Pattern In the current 2025 chart, Ethereum has reportedly claimed the 50-week Moving Average (MA) after months of downward pressure and range-bound movement. Following a decisive breakout from support levels near $2,250, the price of the cryptocurrency is now consolidating below the 50 MA, forming a tight sideways pattern. Related Reading: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025 According to Merlijn the Trader, this structure is visually and technically similar to price movements that occurred in late 2016 and early 2017, just before Ethereum began a powerful upward surge. The analyst\u2019s 2017 Ethereum chart shows the altcoin breaking above the 50 MA, followed by a brief period of sideways action under resistance. Once momentum was built, the price launched into a parabolic rally that marked the beginning of its major bull cycle. Notably, the 2025 chart situated on the right panel displays an almost identical playbook to the 2017 setup, with Ethereum moving out of a prolonged accumulation phase and into a zone of consolidation beneath key resistance levels. However, this time, market conditions are significantly different. The analyst notes that the crypto space is far more developed, with increased institutional involvement, broader retail adoption, and growing infrastructure supporting Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. While the technical patterns align closely with the 2017 breakout, the scale and context suggest that the potential upside could even be greater. The similarities between Ethereum\u2019s 2017 and 2025 price action lie in the timing of the 50 MA reclaim and the tight range of consolidation that follows. If ETH can maintain this trajectory and break above the current resistance zone, it could mark the beginning of a fresh macro rally, which the analyst predicts will not just repeat history but possibly amplify it. Ethereum Eyes $4,000 As 2017 Pattern Repeats Based on Merlijn The Trader\u2019s comparable chart analysis, Ethereum may be on the verge of a major breakout, with technical patterns pointing to a potential price target above $4,000. In the 2017 setup, Ethereum skyrocketed past $28 from a low between $6 and $7.5 after reclaiming the 50 MA. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 Cycle? Here\u2019s The Target If history is any guide, Ethereum\u2019s next move could propel it from its current price of $2,541 to $4,000, which aligns with the upper red horizontal line on the 2025 price chart or above the line to fresh all-time highs, with no ceiling in sight, according to the analyst.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-pressure-builds/",
      "summary": "BNB finds itself at a pivotal moment as price action tightens between two critical technical zones. After a period of consolidation, the cryptocurrency is testing resistance near the 200-period moving average, hovering around the $653 mark. Meanwhile, support around the $640 level continues to hold firm, acting as a safety net for bulls trying to defend the current structure. 200 MA Acts As A Ceiling Against BNB Uptrend According to Thomas Anderson in a recent X post, the M15 BNB chart reveals that the price is currently testing resistance around the $651.50 level, marked by a horizontal yellow line. Related Reading: BNB Coils For Impact: Will $670 Crack Under Pressure? This move follows a recent bounce off the ascending white trendline support, indicating that buyers are still defending the short-term uptrend. However, price action remains just beneath the 200-period moving average (red line), which is acting as a dynamic resistance zone near the $653 mark. Momentum indicators are offering mixed signals at the moment. The MACD continues to print negative values, showing that bearish pressure hasn\u2019t fully dissipated, while the RSI has started recovering from previously oversold conditions. This combination suggests the potential for a short-term bounce within the ascending channel. M30 And H1 Charts Are Aligning In an updated post, the analyst also went further to examine the BNB M30 chart, where price is currently trading at $650.10 and appears to be consolidating just below the 200-period moving average (red line) situated around the $653 level. This area is acting as a key short-term resistance zone, and price action has shown hesitation around it, reflecting a battle between buyers and sellers. Interestingly, the H1 chart mirrors this behavior, showing a broader ascending channel structure that suggests an underlying bullish bias, though still unconfirmed. Related Reading: BNB Price Reclaims $600 \u2014 Is This the Start of a Major Upside Move? The immediate resistance to watch remains near the $653 mark, aligned with the 200 MA on both the M30 and H1 timeframes. If bulls can muster enough strength to break and sustain above this level, it could trigger a fresh wave of upward momentum for BNB toward the next resistance at $657. This would represent a potential continuation of the ascending channel&#8217;s structure and hint at growing bullish control in the short term. On the flip side, if price fails to push above the $653 resistance, consolidation may begin to lose steam. In such a scenario, a retreat toward the previous swing low near the $640 level becomes likely. This support area has already proven its strength and could be the next level of defense if bearish pressure increases. Traders are watching closely, as these levels may determine BNB&#8217;s next directional move. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "In a post on June 17, prominent crypto strategist Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) outlined his high-conviction roadmap for Bitcoin\u2019s next major breakout, emphasizing that timing\u2014not just price\u2014is the most critical factor for those still on the sidelines. Despite projecting a continuation of the broader uptrend that began at $18,000 in 2023, Astronomer warned that jumping in prematurely could blunt the risk-reward ratio of the next leg. \u201cPlanning to buy now into BTC is expected to net you a move of over 70% in a short period of time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the closer BTC is to breaking out.\u201d Buy Bitcoin Now? His primary thesis: Bitcoin\u2019s breakout will not occur before June 30, and any significant move is statistically more likely after that date. This aligns with what he calls one of the \u201cmost ancient crypto mechanics\u201d\u2014Bitcoin moves first, and altcoins follow. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Astronomer\u2019s roadmap presents a tiered accumulation strategy rooted in probabilistic support zones. \u201cUpon statistical analysis, the expected close before going up only is around $103k,\u201d he wrote. \u201cProbably a good level to start getting involved. [\u2026] The expected level to be reached based on all prior signals (lowest wick) is $96k. Probably a good level to buy heavy if given. [\u2026] And finally, the expected lowest close is $90k. Probably a good level to allocate (almost) all your dry powder.\u201d But beyond the price levels, Astronomer places stronger emphasis on timing: \u201cIf the price doesn&#8217;t go as deep into the $90\u2019s\u2014which I don&#8217;t think is very likely\u2014I expect June to close between $95-110k and not go much lower. Then I&#8217;d buy more and more the closer we get to those 10 weeks regardless of the price. Time is more important than price.\u201d He also pointed to structural market dynamics supporting his thesis, including a bullish spot-to-perpetual rotation: \u201cThe order books start to rotate towards green into spot, red into perps (aggressive shorts, aggressive spot buys), simply visible with the increasing spot premiums.\u201d Adding to the signal strength is a recent weekly hash ribbon print\u2014\u201cone that never failed,\u201d he noted. Related Reading: $150,000 Bitcoin Is In Play\u2014Unless This One Macro Metric Snaps Astronomer further offered guidance for navigating altcoins, advising traders to wait for the breakout rather than attempting to catch falling knives. \u201cBuying alts when BTC breaks out [\u2026] is smarter than trying to knife catch them. To eliminate the drawdown and reap the upside rewards.\u201d Summarizing his plan, he said, \u201cIf I was sidelined, I&#8217;d look to buy below $103k and as much as possible as close to $90k as possible. And the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the more confident I become.\u201d Astronomer\u2019s final message underscores that his bullish stance hasn\u2019t changed since the flip at $18K: \u201cNo top being in yet, until we reach at least 170k+. That is the plan.\u201d And for those still unsure? He offers a blunt reminder: \u201c"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-could-rise-3x-to-300000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has continued to hover above the $100,000 mark over the past few days, and its price action has stabilized around $105,000 in the wake of recent market tensions and despite inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. A new analysis shared by crypto market commentator Gert van Lagen suggests that this current phase is going to precede an explosive move similar to those seen in previous market cycles. Backing his prediction with historical data and Glassnode\u2019s AVIV Ratio chart, the analyst noted that the current on-chain structure echoes moments before Bitcoin\u2019s major rallies in past bull markets. AVIV Ratio Flashes Familiar Pattern Before Market Top Bitcoin&#8217;s price volatility has slightly cooled since the initial surge to a new all-time high above $111,800 in May, and the latest candlestick structure suggests it may be preparing for another leg higher. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? Taking to the social media platform X, Gert van Lagen revealed a Bitcoin price prediction that centers around the true market Deviation metric known as the AVIV Ratio. This orange-colored line on the chart tracks a specific deviation in Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior and has always crossed a red line denoting +3 standard deviations at or just before cycle tops. The current AVIV behavior can be compared to previous price points before market tops in previous cycles. For instance, in 2013, the AVIV Ratio flagged a major rally when Bitcoin was trading near $200, shortly before the price pushed past $1,200. In 2017, the metric behaved similarly when Bitcoin was trading at $3,700 and later peaked near $20,000. The current AVIV Ratio can also be compared to when Bitcoin was priced at $13,000 in the 2021 bull market run, before its surge to an all-time high of $69,000. According to the analyst, today\u2019s AVIV ratio level is closely aligned with those previous mid-cycle breakouts. The current ratio has not yet crossed the red +3\u03c3 line, which the analyst refers to as the cycle top trigger. As such, its current reading suggests Bitcoin may be in the early phase of a major bull market expansion. If history repeats itself, a 3x move from today\u2019s levels would be a standard price move in line with previous price action. $300,000 Target Within Sight If AVIV Behavior Holds Crypto analyst van Lagen stops short of calling for an immediate top, but his analysis implies that Bitcoin could be preparing for a new parabolic surge to the upside. Using the AVIV model as a reference, a conservative 3x multiplier on the current Bitcoin price places a possible target around $300,000. Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,997, having decreased by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-alert-expert-reveals-hottest-opportunities-for-the-summer-season/",
      "summary": "As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to impact cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin (BTC) recently dipping below the $105,000 mark, market analyst VirtualBacon has shared insights suggesting that altcoins are gearing up for a potentially robust summer. Emerging AI Memecoins In a recent update on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), he highlighted several promising developments within the altcoin space. VirtualBacon pointed to an emerging wave of AI-focused Layer-1 blockchain projects, many backed by prominent figures in both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. He mentioned several names to watch, including Sahara Labs, Sentient AGI, and Gaianet, among others. While these projects have yet to release tokens, many are expected to conduct airdrops or early access rounds, presenting opportunities for early investors. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge For those seeking \u201chigher-risk, high-reward investments,\u201d VirtualBacon noted the impressive performance of artificial intelligence (AI) agent memecoins. He cited the launch of IRIS, which skyrocketed from a $220,000 fully diluted valuation (FDV) to $120 million, representing a 600x return. Platforms such as Virtuals, CreatorBid, and SeedifyFund are turning user engagement into allocation opportunities, likening this phenomenon to a form of airdrop farming on steroids. In addition, VirtualBacon highlighted a relatively overlooked area: Bittensor subnet tokens. He mentioned that seasoned investors can now acquire early-stage subnets directly on Bittensor\u2019s chain, with projects like SN65_TPN and inference_labs raising capital through token auctions at valuations below $4 million. Stablecoins Take Center Stage Turning to real-world assets (RWAs), VirtualBacon advised focusing on mid-cap infrastructure projects with tangible revenue streams. He pointed to CHEX and CPOOL, which has shown consistent upward movement, as examples of promising investments. Another emerging narrative is the merger and acquisition activity involving public companies and crypto projects. VirtualBacon noted that Tron is set to go public through a Nasdaq reverse merger, while Mixie has been acquired by Netcapital, which boasts a team that includes notable figures like Tim Draper and a co-founder of Helium. A particularly intriguing development is World Liberty Financial (WLF), co-founded by Eric and Donald Jr. Trump, which aims to become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With plans for its own stablecoin, USD1, and expected to launch in October, the token could have an estimated FDV of $10\u201315 billion, a conservative projection given its potential. VirtualBacon also pointed out that stablecoins are becoming central to macroeconomic strategies. Tether now ranks as the fifth-largest holder of US Treasuries, highlighting the increasing need for buyers in the market. The analyst urged investors to keep an eye on stablecoin projects that integrate artificial intelligence technology and yield generation, such as USD1, Circle\u2019s USDC, and others. Liquidity Shifts To Altcoin Platforms In the gaming sector, liquidity is coalescing around BlackholeDex, a decentralized exchange (DEX) backed by the AVAX Foundation. With a fee-sharing model similar to Aerodrome and Shadow, BlackholeDex has launched veNFT staking, aligning long-term incentives for users. Related Reading: Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come Lastly, in the Solana ecosystem, Saros DLMM is emerging as a strong competitor to existing platforms like Jupiter and Meteora, utilizing similar bucket-based liquidity pools but with lower fees. It also plans a RADY meme airdrop for SAROS stakers, which could attract early adopters and fuel rapid growth, thus closing the list of highlighted altcoins. As of this writing, Ethereum, the market\u2019s leading altcoin, is trading at $2,521. It has consolidated above this level after dropping sharply from its two-week high of $2,878.
