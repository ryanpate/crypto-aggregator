      "summary": "Data shows the demand for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has cooled off for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has continued to attract inflows. Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency&#8217;s price movements in a manner that&#8217;s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. &#8220;Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,&#8221; notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. &#8220;Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. &#8220;A pause in demand after a strong run-up &#8211; watch for signs of re-acceleration.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30\u2014Is A New All-Time High Next?

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-weekly-structure-tightens-tower-top-pattern-in-play/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has pulled back roughly 14% since the last week of May, but it\u2019s holding firm above the critical $2,400 support zone. Despite recent volatility across the crypto market, ETH\u2019s ability to defend this level has kept hopes alive for a potential recovery. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum\u2019s next move, as the asset still trades well below its yearly highs, offering room for upside if momentum returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 \u2013 Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups. However, many believe ETH is now positioned to recover lost ground \u2014 if bulls can reclaim the $2,800 resistance and flip it into support. A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row \u2014 a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH \u201cstill looks pre-tower top,\u201d suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400\u2013$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum\u2019s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle \u2014 a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000\u2013$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3.

ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages \u2014 including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart \u2013 Rally Ahead?

      "title": "Is Altcoin Season Still Coming? Why Bitcoin Is To Blame Despite Making ATHs",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/is-altcoin-season-still-coming/",
      "summary": "Despite Bitcoin\u2019s historic rise above the $100,000 mark in early 2025, a growing number of crypto investors are left wondering when the long-anticipated altcoin season will begin. At the time of writing, the altcoin season index from BlockchainCenter has now dipped to a reading of 20, far below the 75 threshold typically required to confirm the start of an altcoin season. In a detailed post on social media platform X, van de Poppe addressed what is one of the most frequently asked questions in the crypto industry today: \u201cWhen altseason?\u201d Altcoin Season Missing Despite Bull Market Conditions According to analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, this cycle has deviated significantly from historical patterns. His response to the growing question of an altcoin season relays the fact that while Bitcoin has made gains, the altcoin market continues to lag significantly behind, raising doubts about whether a true altseason will even arrive this cycle. Related Reading: Certified Analyst Says Bitcoin Dominance Could Reverse At 64% \u2013 Is It Time For Altcoin Season? In past cycles, altcoins followed Bitcoin\u2019s rally within weeks or months. However, 2024 and the early part of 2025 have proven to be different. This, in turn, has been many investors expecting this cycle to play out the same getting hammered and losing their patience. Although some new meme coins had their brief moments of explosive growth in late 2024, the broader altcoin market has been largely suppressed since late 2021. Van de Poppe explains that most older altcoins failed to match Bitcoin\u2019s performance in 2021, and that trend has only worsened in the current cycle. This has somewhat changed the expectation of a typical four-year cycle rhythm. The tables have turned and other variables need to be taken into account for investors looking to get a significant return in those markets. Bitcoin Dominance And Sentiment Imbalance Holding Altcoins Back One of the clearest reasons for the delay in altseason is Bitcoin\u2019s overwhelming dominance. As the Altcoin Season Index indicates, the metric remains significantly below the 25 threshold line and firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season territory. Van de Poppe attributes this not just to price action, but also to macro-level shifts, such as interest rate regimes and monetary policy from central banks. For now, there\u2019s still much upside potential for Bitcoin, especially if the Fed interest rates were to go down from their current 4% levels. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here\u2019s What Historical Data Says In his view, the current market is divided into two camps: those expecting a bear market and those who believe the bull run is just beginning. Both could be wrong, he warns, because the game has changed. If there are so many factors going into negative sentiment, that\u2019s actually a sign to allocate funds into altcoins. Keeping this in mind, the best time to invest in altcoins would be now, when the altcoin season isn&#8217;t showing any signs. Van de Poppe concludes that altseason isn\u2019t just a timeframe but a phase where patient investors accumulate undervalued cryptocurrencies before the rest of the market catches on. When the altcoin season eventually rolls in, it will come unannounced. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital opened its Monday note with a blunt assessment: \u201cImplied vols continue to come under pressure, with BTC stuck in a tight range as summer approaches.\u201d In the options house\u2019s telling, the market is drifting into the northern-hemisphere holiday season much as it did a year ago, when one-month at-the-money (ATM) volatility collapsed from 80 vols in March to barely 40 vols by July and spot repeatedly \u201cfailed to decisively breach the $70k level.\u201d The difference this year is the new, higher plateau: BTC has sat between $100,000 and $110,000 for most of the past three weeks. The calm is visible beyond Deribit\u2019s options screens. Deribit\u2019s DVOL index, which tracks 30-day implied volatility, is hovering just above 40\u2014one of its lowest prints in more than two years. Realised volatility is even quieter, so even one-year lows on implieds still look \u201coptically rich,\u201d QCP argues. That valuation gap has encouraged traders to sell gamma: perpetual open interest has slipped and the favourite hedge-fund basis trade\u2014long spot via the new ETFs, short futures\u2014has unwound, taking what QCP calls \u201cthe natural bid for vol\u201d out of the market.

Dealers report that July upside strikes around $130,000 and $140,000 are being rolled out to September \u201cin meaningful size,\u201d effectively pushing bullish timelines further down the curve. Meanwhile, Deribit\u2019s put-skew has flattened as short-dated hedges expire worthless\u2014a dynamic that often precedes a directional move once macro catalysts arrive. This Week Could Break Bitcoin\u2019s Lull Those catalysts line up uncomfortably close. On Wednesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish May consumer-price data. April\u2019s headline CPI rose a modest 0.2% month-on-month and 2.3% year-on-year, while core prices advanced 0.2% on the month and 2.8% on the year. Economists look for headline CPI to quicken to 0.3% on the month and 2.5% year-on-year, with core CPI seen edging up to 0.3% and 2.9% respectively. Producer prices follow on Thursday: April\u2019s PPI fell 0.5% on the month yet still printed 2.4% year-on-year. The consensus expects May PPI to rebound 0.2%, leaving the annual rate near 2.4%. Inflation is not the only macro variable in play. Friday\u2019s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report\u2014139,000 jobs versus a 130,000 consensus\u2014rekindled dollar strength and knocked gold more than one percent lower, but BTC \u201cremained conspicuously unmoved,\u201d QCP noted. The same divergence is visible this morning: US equity futures are slightly softer, spot gold is bid on safe-haven demand, and bitcoin is trading virtually unchanged. Geopolitics may supply the spark that inflation data has so far failed to ignite. Senior US and Chinese officials meet in London today (Monday) in what both sides are calling a push for a limited trade deal that would dial back export-control threats and myriad retaliatory tariffs. The talks matter for crypto because tariffs have been feeding directly into the CPI basket and\u2014via global risk sentiment\u2014into bitcoin demand. \u201cA clean break below $100k or above $110k would likely reawaken broader market interest,\u201d QCP wrote, \u201cbut we currently see no obvious near-term catalyst to drive such a move.\u201d Trade headlines could change that calculus in a single newsflash. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn\u2019t Gone Off Yet \u2014 What To Know Institutional positioning likewise hints at fatigue. US regulatory filings show that large hedge funds trimmed spot-ETF holdings in the first quarter as the lucrative cash-and-carry spread compressed. Net inflows across the 11 US bitcoin ETFs have slowed to a trickle since late May, leaving cumulative additions at roughly $44 billion\u2014unchanged for almost a fortnight, according to Farside data. For now, the market\u2019s centre of gravity is exactly where QCP says it is: inside the $100,000\u2013$110,000 corridor. Volatility sellers continue to collect premium, and the risk-reward for momentum traders remains poor. Yet with CPI, PPI and high-stakes trade negotiations all landing inside a 72-hour window, the premium that option writers are harvesting could quickly look meagre. If the inflation data surprise to the upside, a repricing of Fed-cut expectations could turn last week\u2019s equity rally into a risk-off wobble, yanking bitcoin below six figures for the first time since April. Conversely, a benign print combined with even a symbolic easing of tariff rhetoric could flip the narrative to \u201csoft landing, structural bid via ETFs,\u201d reigniting topside optionality into the June quarter-end. In that scenario the rolled-out September $140,000 calls might come alive far sooner than their buyers now expect. Either way, the clock on bitcoin\u2019s summer doldrums is ticking loudly. \u201cWithout a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging,\u201d QCP warns.
