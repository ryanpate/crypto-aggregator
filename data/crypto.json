He shared this on X, renewing a prediction he first made in 2018 when he set his sights on reaching that mark by 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Back then, the crypto market took a sharp downturn in 2022\u2014thanks in part to FTX\u2019s collapse\u2014and the timeline slipped. Still, Draper believes today\u2019s drivers are strong enough to push prices higher. He even suggested that the US dollar might vanish in a decade as Bitcoin takes its place. Tim Draper\u2019s Bold Timeline According to Draper, the $250,000 target isn\u2019t just wishful thinking. In 2018, he said Bitcoin would reach that level by 2022. It didn\u2019t happen\u20142022 saw many digital assets tumble in value. This year, though, he repeated his forecast after seeing a \u201crecent surge\u201d in the crypto. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I\u2019m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: \u2192 General optimism\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy \u2014 Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 He also claimed Bitcoin could become \u201cinfinite against the dollar,\u201d arguing that in 10 years the US dollar wouldn\u2019t exist. His confident tone suggests he\u2019s sticking with the same numbers\u2014$250,000 by December 31, 2025. Political And Regulatory Drivers Based on reports, Draper points to politics as a big catalyst. He highlighted moves by US President Donald Trump, who is working on new trade deals. One sign of this push is the Media &#38; Technology Group\u2019s filing on June 5, 2025, for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. That application is headed to the NYSE Arca, with Crypto.com lined up as custodian, and it aims to bring more mainstream money into Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, the US Senate voted 66\u201332 on May 19 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would set rules for stablecoins. Plus, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 is under debate. It has bipartisan support and is meant to spell out clear rules for crypto. Financial Institutions And Adoption Draper also sees banks and big companies stepping in. He mentioned that JP Morgan plans to let its clients buy Bitcoin and use spot-BTC ETFs\u2014like BlackRock\u2019s IBIT\u2014as collateral. That shift could open doors to a flood of institutional cash. Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy leads the pack, holding over 580,000 BTC. At current prices, that stash is worth about $61 billion. These moves, Draper argues, point to people treating Bitcoin more like gold than a risky token.

      "summary": "The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a significant decline on Thursday, falling over 7% and approaching the $2,400 mark. However, expert analysis suggests that a new bullish trend may soon emerge for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Key Metrics Indicate Accumulation By Larger Investors Market analyst Lark Davis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum&#8217;s potential. He noted that various on-chain metrics and market behaviors indicate an impending breakout for the ETH price. Notably, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter of the year, suggesting growing investor confidence. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved Ethereum\u2019s scalability and reduced its inflation rate, making it more attractive to investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over Additionally, the expert highlights that with exchange balances hitting seven-year lows and substantial inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it appears that larger investors are accumulating ETH for the long term. Despite these bullish indicators, Davis cautioned that not all market participants share this optimistic outlook. Betting markets on Polymarket currently assign only a 27% chance that Ethereum will reach a new all-time high by 2025. Critical Support For Ethereum Amid Political Disputes The broader cryptocurrency market also faced challenges on Thursday, with total market capitalization dropping from $3.30 trillion to approximately $3.12 trillion. Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana (SOL) were among the notable cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, retracing by 3%, 5%, and 6%, respectively. In a separate but related development, tensions between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk have surfaced, adding to the day\u2019s market volatility. Trump expressed disappointment over Musk&#8217;s criticism of a key tax and spending bill from his administration, suggesting that their &#8220;great relationship&#8221; may be nearing its end. Musk retaliated by accusing Trump of ingratitude, claiming his support was instrumental in Trump\u2019s election victory. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 This public dispute has drawn attention to the intersection of US politics and cryptocurrency, a dynamic that market analyst Income Sharks noted in a recent post on Elon Musk\u2019s social media site, X. The analyst remarked on the swift impact of political conflicts on crypto markets, emphasizing that the Ethereum price has not yet lost critical support levels. Income Sharks, in his analysis, identified the $2,390 mark as a crucial support point for the altcoin in the immediate term, which could determine the next upward targets of $3,000 and $4,000. While trading at $2,406 when writing, Ethereum finds itself well below its all-time high reached during the market\u2019s last bullish cycle in 2021. As of now, the altcoin stands 50% below its record of $4,878, according to CoinGecko data. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s majestic 2024-25 ascent may have stalled at the very moment many traders expected an early-summer melt-up, according to crypto analyst Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX). In an extended thread published today, the Ichimoku-focused technician argues that the market printed a \u201cvalid cycle high\u201d on the weekly chart and has now slipped into neutral territory\u2014potentially postponing the next decisive breakout until mid-July or, failing that, as late as the first quarter of 2026. Bitcoin Bottom Not In? \u201cI warned multiple times that we can\u2019t be bullish on the weekly before the 9th of June,\u201d Dr Cat reminded followers. The Chiko Span (CS) \u201centered the candles\u201d last week, he noted, stripping the weekly timeframe of its bullish bias even though the long-term monthly structure remains intact. \u201cBecause the monthly chart is bullish, things are still long-term bullish,\u201d he conceded, yet the immediate path higher has narrowed to two clear windows. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History\u2019s Turning The first window opens in the week beginning 16 June. If Bitcoin starts that week above $99,881 and closes with CS breaking cleanly above the candle range, Dr Cat believes \u201cthe moonshot, potentially to $270,000,\u201d could ignite. Should price open below that threshold, a textbook CS tracing pattern would already be underway, pushing the next breakout target to the week commencing 14 July (or the one immediately after). \u201cSimply because these are the places where CS can make a clear breakout above the candles terminating a CS tracing,\u201d he explained. Below $93,200\u2014the current position of the weekly Kijun Sen\u2014the bullish countdown is voided. \u201cIf the Kijun Sen at 93.2K is lost, we consider much later breakout,\u201d Dr Cat warned, pointing traders to a broad monthly window between November 2025 and April 2026 when the Kijun Sen itself is expected to slope upward again. Until then, he is \u201cnot confident that the bottom is in,\u201d flagging $97\u201398 K as a short-term confluence zone in which the daily Kumo cloud, the weekly Tenkan Sen and the two-day Kijun Sen intersect. The analysis comes at a delicate moment for sentiment. Bitcoin\u2019s April all-time high above $111,999 has so far resisted several retests, and funding rates on major derivatives venues have eased from euphoric to merely positive. For Dr Cat, such moderation is consistent with Ichimoku\u2019s Kihon Suchi 17-period rhythm: \u201cTime cycles \u2026 give a valid cycle high on the weekly. I think at this point it obviously printed,\u201d he wrote, implying that a fresh consolidation phase is statistically favored. Altcoin Season Even Further Delayed Altcoins face an even steeper uphill battle. In a companion post dissecting the TOTAL3 index (the market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum), Dr Cat argued that \u201caltcoins are not ready to pump on the weekly and need minimum 1-2 months for that in the most bullish scenario.\u201d Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 He cited four overlapping bearish ingredients: price below the weekly Kijun Sen, a negative Tenkan\u2013Kijun cross, a Chiko Span trapped beneath the candle \u201cforest,\u201d and a Kijun Sen poised to turn down next week. \u201cThe chance for a bullish altcoins explosion in June is around 5 %,\u201d he concluded, assigning a roughly equal probability that Bitcoin alone could rally while \u201cdominance destroys alts.\u201d That dour appraisal extends to Ethereum and other large caps. In Dr Cat\u2019s view, \u201cblindness \u2026 applies to anyone expecting a parabolic bull run above ATH in June for TOTAL3.\u201d The first legitimate \u201cwindow of opportunity for altcoin bulls,\u201d he adds, does not open until August, when the weekly CS will encounter a thinner overhang of historic candles. Market implications hinge on whether Bitcoin can defend its higher-timeframe pivots long enough to align with those temporal windows. So far, the $93.200 Kijun Sen serves as the demarcation line between an orderly pause and a deeper retracement. A weekly close beneath it would \u201cactivate\u201d the November-to-April contingency track\u2014effectively pushing any move toward Dr Cat\u2019s headline $270,000 projection into the next halving cycle.

      "summary": "Kuaishou\u2019s AI video tool \u2013 Kling \u2013 is now a top-earning AI video generation tool. In April and May of 2025 alone, it pulled in a hefty $14M. Given its high demand, Kling\u2019s on track to hitting a whopping $100M in sales by February. This is proof that demand for AI-generated video content is exploding \u2013 a boon for AI crypto projects like SUBBD Token ($SUBBD). Kling Makes Pro-Quality AI Video Creation Affordable Since its June 2024 launch, Kling AI has rolled out over 20 updates. The changes were aimed at enhancing core model performance, refining image clarity, and introducing innovative features for video creators. By using the AI tool&#8217;s \u2018inspiration credits,\u2019 anyone, from solo creators to major brands, can tap into Kling&#8217;s powerful video creation capabilities. The model is extremely straightforward: Want sharper, high definition videos? Spend more credits. Want to save on budget? Lower the tool&#8217;s parameters. It\u2019s super cost-effective, too. For just one dollar, you get 66 credits. Top-quality videos cost approximately 100 credits, whereas simpler versions cost just 20. By using Kling AI, creators now enjoy the freedom to scale their content based on budget, quality, and turnaround times. Tencent Holdings &#38; Alibaba Capitalize on AI Video Hype The AI video space is heating up with growing competition. Hunyuan Video, launched by Tencent Holdings in December 2024, delivers high-quality cinematic video generation with advanced features. These features include dynamic camera movement, lifelike reflections, and seamless transitions between realistic and animated picture styles. Alibaba is also in on the trend, having released Wan 2.1 in February 2025 \u2013 a proprietary suite of open-source AI models. The models are designed for high-quality video generation based on text and image inputs. It\u2019s also gearing up for a major upgrade, Wan 2.1-VACE, which will expand its functionality with advanced tools for reference-to-video generation and video-to-video editing. Let&#8217;s not forget OpenAI. The company is now developing Sora, a new tool for automated video generation. And then there&#8217;s Runway AI&#8217;s $3B valuation. Each of these developments signals a promising future for the SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), which goes a step further. This new crypto project delivers a full-suite of AI powered tools \u2013 not just video creation, but also online content management. SUBBD Leverages AI &#38; Crypto to Reshape Creator Workflows $SUBBD powers a next-gen content creation platform that streamlines creators&#8217; workflows and boosts community engagement through AI and Web3 technology. The digital content creation industry is booming, predicted to grow at a CAGR of 9.59% and reach $39.3B by 2032. Yet, despite the growth, creators still face serious challenges: High management and platform fees; Strict content policies on major platforms; Fragmented AI tools requiring multiple subscriptions; Outdated or slow payment systems. Thankfully, this is where the SUBBD ecosystem comes in, offering a seamless experience for AI-assisted content creation, editing, and monetization. The project achieves this through various AI tools, including a video generator, custom voice creator, and automatic live-streams. Meanwhile, fans get direct access to their favorite creators, and can enjoy personalized ecosystem fees and exclusive content \u2013 without having to rely on intermediaries. Influencers also benefit significantly thanks to a personal AI assistant. This tool is programmed to manage interactions and content schedules. Beyond content and engagement optimization, the personal assistant is an all-in-one tool that also boosts earnings by slashing third-party fees. Buying $SUBBD also ensures subscription discounts, staking rewards at a 20% APY, and XP multipliers for the platform&#8217;s raffles, games, and events. SUBBD to Soar as AI Video Craze Blows Up Kuaishou\u2019s Kling AI is on track to reach $100M in sales. This, coupled with the success of similar providers, like Hunyuan Video, Wan 2.1, Sora, and Runway, demonstrates just how quickly AI-driven video content is scaling. As demand for streamlined, AI-powered content creation continues to rise, SUBBD stands out with its crypto-AI platform that unlocks additional monetization opportunities for creators (including automated live streams and token rewards). To get involved, all you need to do is buy $SUBBD on presale for as little as $0.0556. The presale has raised over $600M so far, and the price is going to increase again in two days. High-earning creators moving to the platform could further push the coin to $0.438 this year \u2013 a 687% gain, based on the current price. Before making any investment decisions, always do your own research first and never spend more than you\u2019d be willing to lose."

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-sends-mixed-signals/",
      "summary": "The XRP price has now moved back into bearish territory after a remarkable run on the daily chart that had been signaling possible bullish momentum. Crypto analyst Master Ananda points this out in a post that shows a disturbing trend in the XRP price chart. If this continues, then the future of XRP, at least in the short term, has become even more uncertain, with bears fighting for more control. 4 Green Daily Closes Fall to Nothing After suffering a crash along with the rest of the crypto market, the XRP price had faced a recovery that seemed to have put it right back on track to rally again. This saw the first green daily close on the last day of May and then carried on into the new month of June. The first three days also closed in the green, leading to four consecutive daily green closes, which is usually bullish for the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings However, there was just another part of the trend that was not completed to show that this was a bullish move, and it has to do with volume. As Master Ananda pointed out, a spike in volume was expected as the XRP price put in a higher low. This would mean there is the momentum needed to push the price back up. But this was not the case as the volume plummeted and remained muted. The absence of this expected volume suggests there is weakness surrounding the XRP price, and this played out as the next day saw a red close for the altcoin for the first time in June. If this lack of momentum continues, then the price could continue to plummet. So far, there is now resistance mounting at the 0.382 Fibonacci level, which is $2.2959. This resistance would need to be cleared with a spike in volume if there is to be a recovery in the XRP price. Otherwise, it risks a fall back down to the 0.236 Fibonacci level, meaning the first steps toward falling below $2.

So far in June, daily volume has remained well below $5 billion, reminiscent of the bear market figures whenever the price was falling. This also shows reduced participation from investors who are wary of entering the market during such conditions. Interestingly, though, open interest remains rather high, $3.94 billion, showing that crypto traders are actively betting on the XRP price. However, the majority are betting that the XRP price will continue to fall from here, with Coinglass data showing 52.75% of all positions being short compared to only 47.25% betting the price will increase.
