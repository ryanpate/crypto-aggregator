      "summary": "Dogecoin\u2019s price is back at a crucial line. It\u2019s testing the $0.168 area for a second time since mid\u2011April. A clear break could send the meme coin spinning lower. Bulls and bears are watching every tick. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Key Support Under Scrutiny According to crypto expert Ali Charts, Dogecoin fell roughly 30% from its mid\u2011May high. That slide brought it down to the same $0.168 mark that held as support last April. If prices drop below that level on a weekly close, there are hardly any bids to slow the fall. Below $0.168 lies what traders call a \u201cgap area,\u201d where past buying activity was sparse. That could open the door to steeper losses and fast moves. Cup And Handle Pattern Based on reports, the current chart forms part of a four\u2011year cup\u2011and\u2011handle setup. The lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle sits right where the handle meets its cup. A clean break above the triangle\u2019s upper trendline would point to a target near $0.75. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 That projection comes from the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the cup\u2019s depth. Hitting $0.75 would mean a 350% gain from today\u2019s levels. Momentum Indicators Signal Weakness Momentum readings have lost much of their shine. After a brief golden cross in May, the 50\u2011day moving average slipped under the 200\u2011day in early June. The MACD line is widening beneath its signal, hinting at longer\u2011term selling pressure. The RSI sits at 42, under the neutral 50 mark, and drifting lower. Under 50 on the RSI often points to more sellers than buyers. With those readings turning sour, bulls need a strong bounce around $0.168 to stay alive. ETF Decision Could Swing Sentiment All eyes now turn to June 15, when US regulators may rule on a spot Dogecoin ETF. Approval would let traditional money flow in from big funds. A thumbs\u2011down or a delay, on the other hand, could spark fresh sell\u2011offs. That decision could make or break the next leg of Dogecoin\u2019s move. Related Reading: Trump Media Makes Moves On Bitcoin And Smartphone \u2013 What\u2019s Next? According to CoinCodex data, Dogecoin has recorded 13 out of 30 green days over the past month, with price swings of about 10.57% on average. Their forecast pegs DOGE at $ 0.20 by July 18, a 17% rise from current levels. Market sentiment sits in the neutral zone, and on\u2011chain signals aren\u2019t flashing clear buy or sell warnings. This week\u2019s action around $0.168 will tell us if Dogecoin can steady itself. Holders and traders should watch volume, weekly closes, and that looming ETF call. If support holds, we may see a rebound. If it breaks, lower levels could come into view fast. Either way, Dogecoin is at a make\u2011or\u2011break moment\u2014and everyone will be listening for the next big clue. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"

      "summary": "Bitcoin is navigating a highly volatile environment, as escalating Middle East conflicts and intensifying macroeconomic risks dominate global headlines. Despite mounting uncertainty, BTC continues to hold firm above the $104K level, signaling strong buyer interest at key support zones. Bulls remain in control for now, but hawkish macro conditions\u2014such as elevated US Treasury yields, persistent inflation concerns, and geopolitical turmoil\u2014pose serious risks that could drive BTC below the critical $100K mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching \u2013 Will History Repeat? The market is divided on what comes next. Some analysts point to strong fundamentals and institutional adoption as fuel for a massive bull run, while others warn of a deeper correction before any upward continuation. Top analyst Darkfost emphasized the importance of monitoring on-chain behavior during such periods of uncertainty. According to CryptoQuant data, realized profits on Bitcoin (7-day moving average) show no major warning signs. Current profit-taking activity remains below $1 billion\u2014similar to levels seen following the October 2024 correction\u2014indicating that investors are neither panicking nor overly euphoric. This muted profit realization could be a sign that long-term holders are still confident in the broader trend, setting the stage for an eventual breakout once macro conditions stabilize. On-Chain Metrics Signal Calm Bitcoin Consolidates As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, fears of a broader war\u2014and the possibility of US intervention\u2014continue to weigh heavily on global markets. Investors remain on edge, with rising oil prices and weakening economic confidence feeding into macro uncertainty. Yet, Bitcoin seems largely unfazed. Despite the heightened geopolitical tension, BTC continues to consolidate just below its all-time high, showing resilience that has both bulls and bears second-guessing their next move. Fundamentally, Bitcoin remains strong. Institutional adoption is steadily increasing, and exchange supply continues to decline, reflecting a trend toward long-term holding and off-exchange accumulation. In many ways, BTC appears to thrive in this environment of volatility and uncertainty. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, realized profits on Bitcoin\u2014measured by the 7-day moving average (7DMA)\u2014show no major warning signs. Current profit levels remain under $1 billion, a range not seen since the end of the October 2024 correction. Even during the recent ATH surge, realized profits stayed well below the January 2025 peak. This lack of aggressive profit-taking suggests that most investors are still holding strong, neither panicking nor rushing to sell. That restrained behavior is playing a key role in Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing consolidation. Without a wave of profit realization, there\u2019s little pressure to force the market down\u2014yet no catalyst strong enough to push it decisively higher either. Monitoring these on-chain signals will be critical in the coming days. If realized profits spike or exchange inflows surge, it may mark the beginning of a new phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions \u2013 Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack BTC Technical Analysis: Key Support Being Tested The 12-hour chart of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows the asset currently trading at $104,292, just above a crucial support level at $103,600. This area, which corresponds to the previous all-time high set in late 2024, has become a key battleground for bulls and bears. BTC has repeatedly bounced from this level in recent weeks, and its ability to hold could determine the direction of the next major move. BTC failed to break through the $109,300 resistance, forming a series of lower highs since tapping the $112,000 level. This suggests a weakening bullish momentum and highlights the importance of current price action around the 50-period SMA, which is now acting as short-term dynamic resistance. Volume has remained relatively stable but showed slight upticks during recent pullbacks, hinting at cautious selling rather than full-blown capitulation. The 100-period and 200-period SMAs, currently sitting at $104,065 and $94,617, respectively, offer additional support beneath the current range, with the 100-SMA now directly aligned with the horizontal $103,600 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support \u2013 Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels If BTC breaks and closes below this demand zone with volume confirmation, it could trigger a move toward the $100K psychological support.

On-chain data also shows that whales are actively accumulating XRP, with the addresses holding one million coins recently reaching a new high. XRP Ledger Records Massive Growth In Past Week In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the XRP Ledger is showing signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The platform revealed that there are now over 2,700 whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP for the first time in the token\u2019s 12-year history. Related Reading: Is There A \u201cSecret XRP Ledger\u201d And Is The Price Really At $1,000? Additionally, Santiment stated that the number of active XRP addresses has averaged over 295,000 daily over the past week. This is notable as the normal daily average over the past three months was between 35,000 and 40,000. It is worth mentioning that the XRPL recorded some major developments last week. One is the launch of Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. This is expected to boost network activity given the increasing demand for stablecoins. Crypto analyst Moon Lambo predicted that this would increase the total value locked (TVL) on the network. He also noted how this was bullish for the XRP price, since users will need the token for every USDC transaction. Furthermore, Ondo Finance launched its tokenized US treasury fund (OUSG) on the XRP Ledger last week, which could have also contributed to the surge in network activity. The BlackRock-backed fund will be mintable and redeemable using the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, Guggenheim also recently partnered with Ripple to launch the first Digital Commercial Paper on the XRPL. Expert Predicts Price Rally Above $4 Amid the surge in network activity on the XRPL, crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the XRP price could rally above $4 and even reach as high as $8. He stated that the altcoin is holding a clear breakout and is getting ready for a major bullish continuation. Marks added that the targets are at $4.80 and $8, marking new all-time highs (ATHs) for XRP. Related Reading: These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $25-$75 In June \u2013 Analyst Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently alluded to a previous analysis in which he stated that the XRP price could make a decision within two weeks. The analyst is confident that the altcoin could rally to as high as $6 on this Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. He has also previously predicted that XRP would reach double digits in this market cycle. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price has again dropped below the $2.25 level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades had warned that the support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and $1.55 could be in play if the $2.25 level holds as resistance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Tron has captured renewed attention following a major development: its planned entry into public markets. Justin Sun, Tron&#8217;s founder, has reached a deal with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment (SRM.O), under which SRM will acquire Tron-related tokens, rebrand as Tron Inc., and appoint Sun as an adviser. This move marks a significant step in bridging the gap between blockchain projects and traditional finance, potentially making Tron one of the first major public blockchain entities. Related Reading: Ethereum Golden Cross Approaching \u2013 Will History Repeat? Meanwhile, rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have sparked volatility across the broader crypto market, including Tron. Despite this uncertain macro environment, Tron\u2019s on-chain fundamentals remain strong. Top analyst Darkfost shared data showing that Tron\u2019s daily transaction volume has surged from 2.5 million in 2021 to over 9 million today. This exponential growth underscores a sharp rise in user activity and developer engagement across the network. The sustained increase in transaction volume also reflects growing confidence in Tron\u2019s infrastructure as a scalable and reliable alternative to other high-throughput blockchains. With both institutional exposure via SRM and strong on-chain growth, Tron finds itself at a pivotal moment in its evolution\u2014one that could reshape its trajectory in the months ahead. Tron Retraces After Public Listing Surge: Network Fundamentals Remain Strong Tron is currently trading around key demand levels after a sharp retrace from Monday\u2019s breakout rally. The surge\u2014triggered by the announcement that Tron would go public via a deal with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment\u2014briefly sent TRX up over 9%, generating widespread attention. However, escalating tensions between Israel and Iran have weighed on market sentiment, dragging the price back to pre-announcement levels. Despite short-term volatility, Tron\u2019s fundamentals continue to paint a bullish picture. According to Darkfost, the Tron blockchain has demonstrated strong and consistent growth since 2021. Daily transaction volumes have risen from 2.5 million to over 9 million, reflecting increasing adoption and sustained demand for its infrastructure. This activity surge signals heightened investor interest and developer confidence in the network. Yet, high volume alone doesn\u2019t guarantee quality. What sets Tron apart is its impressive transaction success rate, which has remained above 96% throughout this growth phase. This reliability counters criticisms often aimed at other high-throughput chains like Solana, where failed or spammy transactions can inflate metrics. Additionally, Tron\u2019s block production has remained stable and linear, showcasing its operational consistency. Even amid rising global transaction fees, Tron continues to attract usage, suggesting that users still view it as a cost-effective, scalable solution. This blend of high performance, strong demand, and network resilience positions Tron as one of the most technically mature blockchains in the current market cycle. If macro conditions stabilize, Tron\u2019s public listing and robust on-chain metrics could reignite bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions \u2013 Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack TRX Price Analysis: Key Support Levels Hold Tron (TRX) is currently trading at approximately $0.273, consolidating just above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which sits around $0.268. After a sharp spike on Monday that pushed the price toward $0.30 following the announcement of Tron going public, the price retraced back to pre-announcement levels amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Despite this pullback, TRX remains in a bullish structure on the daily chart. The 100-day and 200-day SMAs, currently around $0.252 and $0.253, respectively, continue to trend upward and act as solid dynamic support, confirming that the medium- to long-term trend remains intact. Volume surged on the breakout but has since cooled, which is expected during periods of consolidation. Technically, TRX is forming a higher low structure while staying within a broader uptrend that began in late March. As long as the price holds above the $0.268 support level, bulls may attempt another push toward $0.285 and potentially retest the recent high near $0.30. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues \u2013 Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance A break below $0.268 could invalidate the bullish momentum and trigger a move toward the $0.252\u2013$0.255 zone.

      "summary": "Interest is building among XRP investors after Crypto Beast, a well\u2011known analyst, put forward a bold forecast. He sees a minimum breakout level of $8 on the horizon. With the US Securities and Exchange Commission no longer posing a roadblock, Crypto Beast believes XRP has a clear path ahead. Related Reading: Record\u2011High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence His view rests on the idea that the market still hasn\u2019t fully priced in XRP\u2019s cleared status with regulators. Short\u2011term traders and long\u2011term holders alike are tuning in. Regulatory Milestone And Market Reaction According to court records, XRP won a key victory in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that it\u2019s not a security under US law. That moment sent XRP from about $0.48 to $0.93 very fast. But prices slipped back over the next few weeks, bringing it down to the $0.50 area again. Then, after US President Donald Trump won re\u2011election and signaled a shake\u2011up at the SEC, XRP marched into a new range around $2.00. Despite that climb, Crypto Beast argues the legal win hasn\u2019t been fully valued by the wider market. XRP is about to explode. I\u2019m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn\u2019t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn\u2019t consider it a security.$XRP holders are about to PRINT.

A flag pattern formed when XRP pulled back into the $2.00\u2013$3.00 zone. He marked the breakout level at $3.37. By measuring the height of that $3.00 pole and adding it to the low of the flag, he arrived at a target near $10.69. In another post, he set a more conservative floor of $8.80, a roughly 4x gain from today\u2019s price around $2.20. That kind of move would push XRP\u2019s market cap above $500 billion, putting it in league with big firms like Oracle, Netflix and Mastercard. Broader Crypto Trends And Correlation Based on reports from his channel, Crypto Beast isn\u2019t just upbeat on XRP price about to &#8220;explode&#8221;. He\u2019s looking for a 3x rise in Solana, a 2x pop in Ethereum and a 5x run in SUI. Even more, he\u2019s penciled in potential 40x gains for select smaller tokens. Still, these forecasts rest on a growing crypto mood\u2014mostly led by Bitcoin. When BTC stalls or dips, large altcoins often follow suit. So any rally in XRP may need fresh money flowing into the whole market. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Risks And Exit Strategy Crypto Beast says he\u2019ll flag when it\u2019s time to sell. He reminded followers that patterns do fail and charts alone can\u2019t guarantee gains. A sudden market shift or a change in macro sentiment could spoil the setup. He advises setting stop\u2011loss levels and watching BTC for hints. His trust in XRP\u2019s future is strong, but he wants traders to be ready for any twist.
