      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-shows-adoption-strength-as-volume-still-led-by-big-transfers-details/",
      "summary": "Tron (TRX) is once again in the spotlight as it tests the upper and lower boundaries of a key consolidation range that has held for months. The price has been oscillating between $0.211 and $0.295\u2014a range that has acted as both support and resistance since the start of the year. With volatility gradually returning to the crypto market, a breakout from this zone could set the stage for a major directional move. A confirmed push above $0.295 could open the door for a rally toward uncharted territory, while a break below $0.211 might signal a deeper correction. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation According to new data from CryptoQuant, large transactions are currently driving volume dominance on the Tron network. While the majority of transactions on TRON are under $1,000 in size\u2014showing that retail users are actively engaged\u2014it is the high-value transfers that account for most of the total volume, highlighting growing institutional or whale interest in the network. As broader market conditions remain uncertain and altcoins begin to show signs of life, the coming weeks will be critical for TRX. Whether bulls or bears take control will likely depend on how the price reacts to this well-defined consolidation range. Tron Eyes Expansion Amid Growing Network Activity Tron has captured significant attention in recent weeks, driven by a combination of major announcements and strong on-chain activity. A report two weeks ago revealed that Tron is preparing to go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment. While full details have yet to be confirmed by official channels, sources familiar with the matter suggest the process is underway. If completed, this move could mark a historic moment for the blockchain space, giving Tron greater exposure to traditional investors and boosting institutional legitimacy. Despite these developments, price action remains locked in a consolidation phase. The broader market\u2019s volatility and macro uncertainty continue to suppress directional momentum for TRX. However, network fundamentals tell a different story\u2014Tron\u2019s on-chain activity is booming. Top analyst Darkfost highlighted a key insight: large transactions currently drive volume dominance on the TRON network. Although more than 1 million USDT transactions on TRON are below $1,000, just 16,000 transfers above $100,000 dominate in terms of volume. This divergence shows that while retail usage is high, major players are still actively moving large amounts of capital on the network. The consistent dominance of small transfers reflects Tron&#8217;s accessibility and everyday utility among users, while the growing transaction count signals expanding adoption. Together, these factors suggest that Tron is building strong foundations, regardless of short-term price direction. The coming weeks could be pivotal, especially if the public listing advances and TRX breaks its multi-month price range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence \u2013 Altseason Could Be Near TRX Consolidates Near Resistance Amid Growing Momentum Tron is currently trading at $0.2787 after several weeks of sideways movement, as shown in the chart. The asset remains in a well-defined consolidation range between the $0.211 support zone and the $0.295 resistance. Despite several attempts, TRX has been unable to decisively break through the upper boundary, signaling market hesitation. However, the overall price structure remains constructive. The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) are all trending upward, with price currently testing the 50-day SMA as dynamic resistance. This alignment supports the argument for a longer-term bullish structure, even as short-term consolidation continues. Volume has slightly picked up in recent days, suggesting a growing interest among traders. A clear breakout above $0.295 would likely trigger a new upward phase and bring fresh highs into play. Until then, traders are watching for confirmation, as the market tests the upper boundary of the range. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $269M In Net Inflows In 24H \u2013 Bullish Momentum Accelerates With strong fundamentals, increasing on-chain activity, and speculation about Tron\u2019s public listing via reverse merger, momentum could accelerate soon.

      "summary": "Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has warned about a potential crash for the Bitcoin price, after the flagship crypto closed below a critical resistance level. The analyst also highlighted the level that BTC needs to reclaim to invalidate this bearish setup. Bitcoin Price Risks Crash With Weekly Close Below Resistance In an X post, Rekt Capital revealed that the Bitcoin price has closed below the final major weekly resistance at around $108,890. Based on this, he remarked that a possible early-stage Lower High resistance may be developing at around $107,720, with BTC at risk of crashing. The analyst added that Bitcoin will need to reclaim $108,890 as support on the daily to invalidate this Lower High. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs In an earlier X post, Rekt Capital highlighted how significant it would have been if the Bitcoin price had closed above this final major weekly resistance. He noted that BTC had never performed such a weekly close. As such, if that had happened last week, he claimed it would not only be \u201chistoric\u201d but would enable BTC to enjoy a new uptrend into new all-time highs (ATHs). However, the Bitcoin price now appears to be on a downtrend, having failed to hold above the $107,720 level successfully. BTC had reached an intraday high of $107,970 but has since then been on a decline and is now at risk of losing the $106,800 macro level. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has warned that BTC being below this level puts it in the danger zone. Meanwhile, based on historical bull market cycles, Rekt Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still has some more upside left. In an X post, he stated that history suggests that Bitcoin may end its bull market in two to three months. BTC Still Fuel In The Tank Despite the recent Bitcoin price drop, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto declared that the flagship crypto still has fuel in the tank. He claimed that the weekly market structure remains strong with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The analyst added that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pushing towards its trendline.

      "summary": "After rebounding from a local bottom of around $75,000 in April, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be stuck in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, showing little indication of a clear directional trend. One key data point reflecting this indecision is Bitcoin\u2019s network volume. Bitcoin Network Volume Stuck In Balance Zone According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, Bitcoin\u2019s network volume has stabilized in a state of &#8216;stable equilibrium,&#8217; reminiscent of the mid-2021 consolidation phase that preceded a major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, Bitcoin network volume refers to the total value of BTC transferred across the blockchain over a specific period, typically used to gauge market activity and capital flow. Higher network volume suggests increased investor engagement and liquidity, while lower volume may indicate reduced interest or market stagnation. Notably, when BTC reached the upper end of its current range &#8211; around $110,000 &#8211; its average network volume surged to as high as $67 billion. Since then, the metric has slightly declined and now hovers around $58.7 billion. Since January 2024, Bitcoin\u2019s average network volume has ranged between $40 billion and $80 billion. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this corridor has become a key indicator of network activity balance and broader market sentiment. Historically, when the Bitcoin average volume approached the upper-end of the range at $80 billion, it coincided with local price peaks of $70,000 and $100,000. On the contrary, moves toward the lower-end &#8211; around $40 billion &#8211; were associated with short-term pullbacks, though these dips were often quickly bought up by market participants. Currently, the $58.7 billion reading sits near the midpoint of this range, mirroring the consolidation phase observed in mid-2021. The analyst explained: As long as the indicator remains above the $40 billion level, we can speak of a stable fundamental market condition. Rising volumes above the $80 billion mark will confirm strengthening activity and fresh capital inflow. On the other hand, a sustained drop below $40 billion will indicate weakening network demand and may be a harbinger of a deeper correction. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? While Bitcoin network volume suggests the market is in a state of equilibrium, some on-chain metrics hint at a potential breakout building in the background &#8211; possibly paving the way for renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall For example, the BTC short-term holder floor has been rising steadily in recent months, currently hovering around $98,000.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-break-above-108500/",
      "summary": "A crypto analyst has forecasted a powerful Wave 3 Bitcoin price rally that could take it toward new all-time highs between $160,000 and $200,000. Notably, this surge is expected to come with rising Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) and a delayed altcoin season, particularly if BTC can make a clean break above the $108,500 resistance level. Bitcoin Price Breakout To Spark Next Bull Run The Bitcoin price is currently hovering below a critical resistance level at $108,500, and according to a crypto analyst known as \u2018BigMike7335\u2019 on the X social media platform, a clean breakout and flip of this level into support could ignite an explosive Wave 3 bull run. Based on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci Extension analysis, a successful move above this threshold could open the door to a bullish price surge with potential targets set in the $160,000 to $200,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Double Top Above $106,000: FVG Says A Large Crash Is Coming The analyst\u2019s chart shows that Bitcoin has already completed its Wave 1 of a five-wave impulse move, followed by an ABC corrective Wave 2. The market is also currently consolidating, and Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum appears to be rebuilding. These positive developments are supported by a rising Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the oversold region and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, both of which point toward upward price action. Notably, the 0.618 and 1.0 Fibonacci Extensions around $117,795 and $137,421, respectively, are highlighted as interim resistance zones where price momentum could temporarily slow before continuing upward. A clean breakout above $108,500 could also place Bitcoin above a heavy volume node visible in the volume profile within the chart, suggesting less overhead resistance and a stronger potential for a price rally. Furthermore, the analysis implies that during this powerful Wave 3 phase, Bitcoin Dominance will likely climb toward 70%. This increase in BTC.D would mean capital is concentrating in the leading cryptocurrency, which historically results in altcoins underperforming. As a result, the expected altcoin season for this cycle may be postponed, following the completion or cooling of Wave 3. Analyst Predicts $375,000 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak Crypto analyst TechDave has just sounded the alarm on what he calls the Bitcoin \u201claunch signal\u201d, a rare trigger that has only appeared four times in history and each time marked the start of major bull market rallies. This signal previously appeared in October 2012, July 2016, and July 2020\u2014all preceding major upward moves that ended in new cycle peaks. Related Reading: Fading Spot Volumes And Muted Futures Sentiment Threaten To Send Bitcoin Below $99,000 Again Currently, the same signal is emerging this July, aligning with the previous cycle structures and reinforcing the expectation of a breakout phase.
