      "summary": "Bitcoin is still trying to regain short-term bullish momentum, as shown by its price action in the past 24 hours. After briefly slipping below $104,500, the cryptocurrency bounced back to trade above $106,000, and technical analysis now shows a technical formation that could cause the start of a more extended rally. Interestingly, as seen in the daily Ichimoku chart shared by analyst Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin is currently on the verge of confirming a golden cross, which is a bullish signal, within the coming days. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin \u2013 Details Ichimoku Cloud Builds Case For Bullish Breakout Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted the recent daily price close above the Tenkan line as a strong technical signal for Bitcoin. The Tenkan, also known as the conversion line, is an intriguing indicator for short-term trend strength in Ichimoku analysis. According to the analyst, the current setup on Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart shows the conditions aligning for a golden cross where the shorter-term average overtakes the longer-term one, which is a potential long-term bullish shift. This crossover, if confirmed, would be one of the most reliable trend-reversal patterns in technical trading. Right now, Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is consolidating around $105,000. However, if this golden cross does play out well, Bitcoin could attempt another run toward the key resistance level around $111,600. However, current geopolitical instability, especially the rising tensions in the Middle East, could disrupt this technical picture at any moment and cause a reassessment of the bullish outlook. Image From X: Titan of Crypto Support And Whale Activity Clash With Bullish Setup Despite the bullish technical backdrop, other market signals are flashing warnings for Bitcoin. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez identified $104,124 as an important support level for Bitcoin. This price point is not just arbitrary, as it represents a heavy concentration of UTXO realized prices. Many investors bought in at that level, and if Bitcoin falls below it, the next likely destination could be $97,405. The URPD chart confirms that the safety net between $104,000 and $97,000 is somewhat thin. This means that once $104,000 is breached to the downside, a swift and steep correction could follow due to the lack of strong buying interest in that gap. Image From X: Ali_charts Further complicating the picture is the behavior of large Bitcoin holders. On-chain data shows that some of the biggest whales, addresses holding over 1,000 BTC, have started reducing their holdings in recent days. This decline in whale wallet count initially began shortly after Bitcoin reached its new all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. The reduction in whale count resumed again after Bitcoin was rejected at the $110,000 region early last week.

      "summary": "The Bitcoin market continues to react negatively to rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran which has induced a wave of concern in the financial markets. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation movement between $105,000 &#8211; $106,000 following slight, after prices crashed to below $103,000 on Friday. Meanwhile, prominent analytics company Glassnode has shared some valuable insight into the Bitcoin market dissecting the growth of the current bull cycle so far. Bitcoin Demand Matches Maturation Rate In an X post on June 14, Glassnode draws comparisons of Bitcoin price growth in the present market cycle to previous ones. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump\u2019s World Liberty Connection Notably, the crypto market cycle is a recurring four-year period marked by consecutive phases of accumulation, a bull market, distribution and a bear market. In the last two cycles i.e 2015-2018 and 2018-2022, Bitcoin achieved price gains of 1076% and 1007%, respectively, significantly multiplying its market cap. For the current cycle from 2022 till date, Bitcoin\u2019s prices have now grown by 656%. While this figure is far off previous cycles, Glassnode reports that it&#8217;s a commendable achievement considering the premier cryptocurrency\u2019s maturation in the past four years marked by an exposure to institutional investors and a $2 trillion valuation. Generally, assets are expected to produce little exponential growth with continued price growth. This can be seen with gold only achieving an estimated 192% growth over the past 10 years. Therefore, Glassnode notes that Bitcoin\u2019s 6x market gain since 2022 is highly positive development that reflects a sustainable market demand even as the asset\u2019s market cap grows. Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $105,540 following a slight 0.20% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset\u2019s daily trading volume is down by 35.39% representing significant fall in market participation. Interestingly, reputable analytics firm Sentora reports the Bitcoin network weekly fees fell by 3.31% following recent negative political events coupled with an already uncertain market sentiment. Meanwhile, exchange inflows also grew by $2.4 billion indicating a significant amount of investors are looking to distribute their holdings while the premier cryptocurrency struggles to re-establish a bullish price direction.

      "summary": "The price of Bitcoin has managed to stay afloat over the past few days despite the growing conflict in the Middle East and the ensuing bearish pressure. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $105,000 level, with its value down by merely 0.8% in the past week. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price might not be down for too long, as investors seem unbothered by the rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Below is what the BTC investors have been up to since the military action started in the past week. BTC Investors Still Holding On To Their Assets: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, CryptoMe revealed that the Bitcoin market has remained relatively quiet despite the ongoing geopolitical events. The relevant indicators here are the Bitcoin exchange netflow and Open Interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke To start, CryptoMe analyzed the BTC Exchange Netflow, which measures the difference between Bitcoin sent to and withdrawn from centralized exchanges. Typically, this metric helps to gauge the selling pressure on a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Given that one of the services offered by exchanges is selling, exchange inflows are often considered a bearish signal for the Bitcoin price. However, CryptoMe noted that there has been no significant change in Netflow, meaning that investors are not looking to offload their assets. The on-chain analyst also highlighted the Open Interest on centralized exchanges, which estimates the amount of capital flowing into a cryptocurrency at every given time. CryptoMe attributed the reduced Open Interest to the liquidated long positions following the price correction. The crypto pundit added: But when we look at the bigger picture, Open Interest still looks strong, and investors are still keeping their positions open FOR NOW despite all the WAR news. Furthermore, CryptoMe mentioned the Bitcoin Open Interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutions and speculators trade. The analyst noted that while some positions were closed and the Open Interest dropped after the event, there has still not been any significant exit movement on the CME. Ultimately, the absence of major movements into centralized exchanges suggests that the investors are not in panic mode yet. While most positions on Bitcoin derivatives are still open at the moment, there is no telling what will happen if the war tension escalates further. Hence, investors might want to approach the market with caution over the next few days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,760, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "The Ethereum price has not been able to maintain its red-hot start to the year&#8217;s second quarter, with the altcoin&#8217;s value still pretty much around where it was at the start of June. This sluggish performance comes despite the consistent capital inflows witnessed by the US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the past four weeks. ETH ETFs Snap 19-Day Positive Inflow Streak However, this positive record came to an end on Friday, June 13th, with the spot ETH ETFs registering their first net outflow in the past 20 days. According to the latest market data, the crypto-linked financial products posted a total daily net outflow of $2.14 million to close the week. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds $2,500 Support \u2013 History Signals $4,000 As Potential Target This round of withdrawals could be linked to the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran on Thursday evening, with risk assets like crypto and stocks feeling most of the impact. Data from SoSoValue shows that the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (with the ticker FETH) contributed to most of the withdrawals on the day, recording a net outflow of $8.85 million. Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) was the only other fund that recorded any significant activity, posting a positive net inflow of $6.67 million on Friday. Cumulatively, the activities of these two exchange-traded funds led to a negative outflow day, ending the 19-day positive inflow streak. Nevertheless, this single-day performance barely made a dent in the Ethereum ETFs&#8217; record over the past week, which stands at $528.12 million. This significant performance extends the exchange-traded funds&#8217; weekly streak to five consecutive weeks of positive inflows \u2014 registering a total capital influx of $1.384 billion in that span. Ethereum Price And Growing Spot ETF Demand As seen with Bitcoin and its spot ETFs, the Ethereum price tends to react to the activity of the ETH exchange-traded funds investors. As such, periods of significant capital inflows for the spot ETFs have been correlated with upward price movements for the cryptocurrencies. However, the price of Ethereum didn&#8217;t exactly follow this trend during its recent 19-day period of substantial capital inflows. This positive streak started on May 16, with the Ethereum price ranging between the $2,500 and $2,600 region on the day. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance While the altcoin&#8217;s price has exceeded this level since then, it has not been able to mount a sustained upward run. Recently, the Ethereum price broke above the $2,800 level on Thursday, June 12, before crashing down towards $2,500 due to the military actions in Asia. As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,511, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. With the Ethereum price still pretty much where it was at the start of the positive ETF inflow streak, there is a worry about what could be holding back the second-largest cryptocurrency.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-weekly-candle-hints-at-pre-tower-top-formation-details/",
      "summary": "Ethereum is trading at a critical juncture after intense volatility rocked the broader market following renewed conflict in the Middle East. After pushing above the $2,800 resistance earlier this week, ETH bulls appeared to regain control. However, the price action failed to hold above that level, pulling back sharply and signaling hesitation among market participants. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week \u2013 Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? This retracement comes as macroeconomic and geopolitical tensions rise, particularly after Israel\u2019s strike on Iran triggered widespread risk-off sentiment across global assets. Ethereum, often seen as a high-beta asset, has not been immune to the turbulence. Despite this, it continues to hover near important technical zones, maintaining the potential for a larger move in either direction. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the situation, highlighting a notable technical pattern: ETH is flexing another small body with an upper shadow on the weekly chart. This suggests indecision and potential weakness at the top, although the structure is not yet fully compromised. The next few daily candles could be pivotal in defining Ethereum\u2019s short-term trend. Bulls must reclaim $2,800 with conviction to re-establish momentum, while further downside could open the door for a deeper correction toward previous consolidation zones. Ethereum Holds Range As Market Awaits Next Move Ethereum has lost over 15% since last Wednesday, retracing from local highs near $2,830 and falling back into the trading range that has held since early May. Despite the drop, ETH remains structurally intact, still respecting the broader consolidation zone. However, price action continues to stall below the $2,770 resistance, keeping traders and analysts split on the next move. Some market participants believe Ethereum could ignite the next altcoin season if it manages to break above its current range with conviction. A decisive close above $2,800 could reestablish bullish momentum and signal capital rotation from Bitcoin into ETH and broader altcoins. Others remain cautious, pointing to weakening momentum, global instability, and a failure to sustain support as early warning signs of a potential breakdown below the $2,500\u2013$2,550 area. Adding to the analysis, Cheds shared a technical perspective showing that Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart is printing yet another small-bodied candle with an upper shadow. This structure is consistent with what he sees as a \u201cpre-tower top\u201d setup \u2014 a pattern that often precedes heightened volatility or a reversal. It highlights the market\u2019s current hesitation and the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers. Macroeconomic conditions are not helping either. Rising US Treasury yields continue to pressure risk assets, while ongoing geopolitical turmoil\u2014especially the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran\u2014adds another layer of volatility and fear across financial markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds $2,500 Support \u2013 History Signals $4,000 As Potential Target ETH Struggles To Hold Breakout Ethereum is trading at a critical juncture after failing to hold the breakout above the $2,770 level. The chart shows ETH slipping back into its prior range, with price now testing support around $2,530 after a sharp intraday decline. This move follows a failed breakout attempt, as the price was rejected near the 200-day moving average, currently acting as dynamic resistance just below $2,650. The volume spike on the recent sell-off confirms strong bearish interest, increasing downside pressure. ETH is now sitting close to the lower end of a trading range that has persisted since early May. A decisive break below $2,500 could open the door for a drop toward the 50-day moving average near $2,380. This would put Ethereum on a path to retest earlier consolidation levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Stress As Israel-Iran Conflict Shakes Sentiment \u2013 ETH/BTC Support In Focus On the upside, bulls must reclaim the $2,650\u2013$2,770 resistance zone and establish a higher low to revive bullish momentum.
