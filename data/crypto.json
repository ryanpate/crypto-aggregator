      "summary": "Ethereum has officially broken below the long-standing range it had maintained since early May, losing the critical $2,320 support level. This breakdown was triggered by escalating geopolitical tensions, as news broke that the United States had launched attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The announcement sent shockwaves through global markets, sparking widespread risk-off behavior and panic selling across crypto. Ethereum, already trading near the bottom of its six-week consolidation range, quickly reacted with a sharp drop, dragging the broader altcoin market with it. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels \u2013 Here\u2019s Why The move marks a critical shift in sentiment, as Ethereum now trades outside the range that had served as a battleground between bulls and bears for over a month. With volatility spiking and confidence shaken, traders are re-evaluating risk in light of escalating conflict in the Middle East and broader macroeconomic headwinds. According to top analyst Big Cheds, Ethereum&#8217;s weekly chart is now flirting with a potential tower top pattern completion \u2014 a bearish reversal structure that may signal further downside unless buyers reclaim key levels in the coming days. As the situation evolves, all eyes will remain on ETH\u2019s ability to hold new support levels or risk further decline in a fragile market environment. Ethereum Slides 22% From June Highs \u2013 All Eyes On Weekly Structure Ethereum has lost over 22% of its value since peaking in early June, as global instability and heightened selling pressure weigh heavily on market sentiment. The asset has now broken below its six-week range, triggering concern among investors and adding to uncertainty across the broader crypto space. With rising tensions in the Middle East\u2014particularly following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities\u2014the market has entered a risk-off environment, dragging altcoins like Ethereum into deeper retracements. Despite the volatility, Ethereum remains at the center of investor focus, as many still expect it to lead the next altseason. However, with bulls losing control of key support zones, confidence in a near-term rally continues to waver. Analysts are now split: while some predict a deeper retracement toward the $2,000 region, others argue that Ethereum is nearing exhaustion on the downside and may soon recover. Big Cheds points to Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart, where the price is currently flirting with a potential tower top pattern\u2014a bearish reversal structure. If this pattern confirms, ETH may face another wave of downside before finding demand at lower supply levels. If buyers step in during this pivotal moment, a recovery from this structure could quickly follow. The coming sessions will be critical in determining whether this breakdown extends or turns into a fakeout with bullish continuation. For now, traders should remain cautious, as Ethereum&#8217;s next move could define the tone of the altcoin market heading into July. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates Ethereum Breaks Down Below Support As Volatility Spikes Ethereum has officially broken below the $2,320 support level, signaling a shift in short-term market structure as shown in the 4-hour chart. After weeks of ranging between $2,320 and $2,650, ETH failed to reclaim its moving averages and lost bullish momentum. The price is now trading around $2,260, down sharply from its June highs near $2,900. This recent leg down follows a clean breakdown through the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs, confirming a strong bearish momentum. Volume spikes accompanied the drop, suggesting panic selling likely triggered by geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East. The price broke down aggressively with little resistance, meaning previous demand zones have now become weak. If buyers fail to step in quickly, Ethereum may revisit earlier May support levels around $2,100 or even $2,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move From a technical standpoint, the breakdown invalidates the previous consolidation range, opening the door for a possible extended correction. Until ETH reclaims $2,320 and stabilizes above its moving averages, the risk of continued downside remains high. Market participants should watch closely for volume shifts or bullish divergences, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure as uncertainty continues to dominate the macro environment. The next few sessions will be crucial for price discovery. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-on-chain-activity-down-80-in-5-months-experts-argue-bullish-bearish-implications/",
      "summary": "XRP\u2019s on-chain metrics are reportedly painting a foreboding picture for its price outlook, as data shows a steep 80% decline in new wallet creation over the past five months. This drop in network activity has sparked divided opinions between two expert analysts, with one casting doubts on XRP\u2019s ability to reclaim the $3 mark, and the other rejecting such bearish predictions. XRP Price Surge To $3 Stalled In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst the \u2018Coin Bureau\u2019 highlights that XRP\u2019s momentum appears to be fading fast as new on-chain data from Glassnode reveals a staggering 80% drop in wallet creation since January 2025. This sharp decline in network activity and growth has led the analyst to claim that the XRP price is unlikely to revisit the $3 level anytime soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits\u2014Analyst Reveals Key Insight At the height of XRP\u2019s 2024 rally, both its price and user activity surged in tandem. During that time, new wallet addresses soared to nearly 30,000 per day in November, coinciding with a sharp rally that sent the token\u2019s price surging close to $3. However, the explosive rally proved short-lived, as momentum faded and prices have since reversed. As of mid-June 2025, Glassnode chart shows that new wallet creation has fallen drastically to around 2,000-5,000 per day, while daily active addresses plunged from 577,000 to just 34,000. XRP\u2019s price, meanwhile, has settled just above $2 and has remained largely range-bound, failing to show signs of a sustained breakout. According to Coin Bureau, this significant drop in on-chain engagement indicates that interest in XRP may have dried up, removing one of the key drivers behind its previous rally. Without new users entering the ecosystem or existing ones increasing XRP\u2019s on-chain activity, the analyst warns that the conditions necessary for an immediate $3 price reclaim aren\u2019t present. Analyst Debunks Bearish Forecast While Coin Bureau\u2019s data paints a picture of declining interest and slow price growth, one crypto expert, known as Moon Lambo on X, has pushed back against the bearish narrative. He argues that XRP\u2019s network activity actually reflects growing strength and long-term confidence. The chart presented by the analyst, covering wallet creation data from June 2024 to June 2025, shows an undeniable spike in network activity between November and early January\u2014a surge that peaked during a period of heightened market enthusiasm following the US elections.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-cbd-heatmap-marks-95500-97000-as-make-or-break-zone-details/",
      "summary": "Since hitting a new all-time high almost a month ago, Bitcoin has done little to assure investors of intent to explore new price territories. Amid announcement of new US trade tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, the premier cryptocurrency has come under bearish influences to trade as low as 101,000. At press time, Bitcoin is hovering near $104,000 following a 2.03% % decline in the past day. However, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted a crucial price range worth monitoring especially in the advent of a further price decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential $95,500\u2013$97,000: Bitcoin\u2019s Line In The Sand In a recent X post, Glassnode shares an insight into the Bitcoin market based on data from Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap. The CBD is a common on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last purchased or sold. When a substantial amount of coins are traded within a specific price range, it forms a supply cluster capable of acting as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode\u2019s report, the Bitcoin\u2019s CBD heatmap shows the first dense supply cluster below the current market price lies at $95,500 &#8211; $97,000 price zone. Interestingly, this range rests just below the short-term holders (STH) cost basis suggesting a confluence of technical and on-chain metric to present a high-stake battleground. Therefore, Glassnode analysts explain that holding the market price above this threshold reinforces bullish momentum and boosts Bitcoin chances of re-entering a price discovery mode. However, a breakdown below the $95,500 price level could trigger panic selling supporting bearish projections for the mid-term to short-term. Interestingly, prominent market analysts including anonymous X expert with username Mr. Wall Street has backed the latter scenario stating Bitcoin is due for a further price drops. Mr. Wall Street strictly warns Bitcoin would not hold above the $100,000 psychological support zone forecasting a price fall to around the $93,000 &#8211; $95,000 which Glassnode predicts should induce widescale market liquidations.

During this period, the flagship cryptocurrency remained largely under $106,000 barring a weak price breakout between June 16 and June 17. On a monthly scale, Bitcoin has now recorded a 6.10% loss, signaling a gradual shift in momentum with bearish forces regaining control of the market. Meanwhile, with a market cap of $2.05 trillion, the &#8220;digital gold&#8221; continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency with a reported market dominance of 64.3%.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/chainlink-bears-push-to-12-50/",
      "summary": "According to an analysis posted on X by CRYPTOWZRD, Chainlink has closed the session with a bearish tone and is now testing the key $12.50 support level. With reduced weekend liquidity expected, price action is likely to remain choppy, making it essential to closely monitor intraday volatility. A clearer setup could take time to develop, but this zone may offer early clues about the token\u2019s next move. Oversold Pressure Builds: Is LINKBTC Ready To Rebound? In his expanded commentary, CRYPTOWZRD underscored that both the LINKUSDT and LINKBTC daily candles closed firmly bearish, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s broader pullback and highlighting the altcoin market\u2019s continued sensitivity to BTC\u2019s moves. He emphasized that this pattern underscores the need for healthier bullish candles to emerge before a sustainable recovery can take hold. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal Stands Firm, But Bitcoin Is Calling The Shots CRYPTOWZRD stated that LINKBTC sits in extremely oversold territory, suggesting that a positive reversal is statistically likely. Should a bounce materialize, he expects it to ignite a sharp upside spike in LINK, effectively flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish in short order. Turning to absolute price structure, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Chainlink is currently trading right at the $12.50 daily support target, a zone he considers pivotal. A decisive bullish reversal from this level, he argues, is essential to trigger an impulsive upside move and reestablish upward momentum. If buyers can reclaim control, CRYPTOWZRD identifies $16 as the next critical resistance, followed by a more substantial barrier at $19.50. Clearing these levels would signal that the tide has truly shifted, paving the way for a broader trend change rather than a short\u2011lived bounce. Despite this bullish roadmap, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin\u2019s weekend price action will remain a major influence on Chainlink, especially given the expected drop in liquidity. As a result, he plans to focus on lower\u2011time\u2011frame charts in the coming sessions, seeking quick scalp opportunities while waiting for clearer confirmation of direction. Chainlink Intraday Setup Builds Around $12.85 Decision Point Assessing the immediate outlook, the analyst notes that LINK\u2019s intraday chart remains bearish and noticeably volatile, underscoring the market\u2019s current uncertainty. Price action has been chopping around key levels, making any clear direction difficult to trust without firm confirmation. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support \u2013 Is A New Breakout Imminent? On the bullish side, the analyst points out that a decisive breakout and sustained hold above the $12.85 intraday resistance could flip sentiment. If buyers manage to establish support above this line, the setup would present a compelling long opportunity with an initial upside target near $14.40, where the next significant resistance resides. Conversely, the analyst warns that a failed attempt to hold $12.85\u2014marked by a retest and subsequent decline- would favor the bears. Such rejection would create potential short setups, as renewed selling pressure could drag the price lower, especially if broader market conditions stay cautious.
