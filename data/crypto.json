SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $150 and $155 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $155 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $160 resistance zone. Solana Price Aims Higher Solana price started a decent increase after it cleared the $152 resistance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL climbed above the $155 level to enter a short-term positive zone. However, the price is facing a major hurdle at $160 and $162. A high is formed at $159.24 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $148 swing low to the $160 high.

A successful close above the $165 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $178. Any more gains might send the price toward the $185 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $155 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $152 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $148 swing low to the $160 high.

      "summary": "Bitcoin continues to hover just below its previous all-time high, consolidating around the $109,000 mark despite a modest 1.9% gain over the past day. The asset reached a 7-day high of $110,307 but has yet to reclaim the historic high of $111,814, a level set back in May. While short-term price action remains within a tight range, on-chain data reveals deeper structural developments that could shape Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory in the weeks ahead. As attention focuses on Bitcoin&#8217;s potential for a breakout, some analysts are turning to supply dynamics for clues. One notable observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee, who has identified a significant reduction in BTC held on centralized exchanges. This trend may serve as a key indicator of future price behavior, especially in the context of institutional demand and exchange activity. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000\u2014Is History Repeating? Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drop to Multi-Year Lows Chairman Lee\u2019s analysis highlights a continued decline in exchange-held Bitcoin, with reserves falling to a multi-year low of 2.4 million BTC. This figure is down from over 3.1 million BTC reported in mid-2023. The consistent drawdown in exchange balances is interpreted as a signal that selling pressure is decreasing, which historically has preceded price expansions. According to Lee, \u201cThis persistent decline in reserve levels suggests that sell-side liquidity is drying up\u2026 Historically, such conditions\u2014where BTC held on exchanges is low\u2014precede major bullish expansions as demand exceeds supply.\u201d In past market cycles, including the 2020\u20132021 bull run, similar drops in exchange reserves were followed by sharp upward movements in Bitcoin\u2019s price. The logic is based on basic supply-demand mechanics: when available BTC becomes scarce on exchanges, any increase in demand, particularly from ETFs or institutional buyers, can lead to accelerated price growth. Lee emphasizes that this current trend could act as a foundational tailwind, potentially supporting further gains if current demand patterns remain in place. Binance Dominates Whale Transaction Flows Another piece of the market structure puzzle comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, who examined large-scale BTC transactions across major centralized exchanges. According to his report, Binance has maintained its position as the dominant venue for Bitcoin whale activity. Whale flows are defined in this context as daily inflows or outflows exceeding 1,000 BTC. Binance has recorded cumulative whale inflows of 31.36 million BTC and outflows of 30.82 million BTC, along with 53.2 million whale transactions, significantly more than any other exchange. Notably, these numbers do not reflect unique BTC, but rather total flow volumes that include repeated movements of the same coins. High transaction volumes suggest Binance is favored for its liquidity and infrastructure, allowing whales to engage in trading, custody shifts, and arbitrage with minimal friction.

The data also places HTX Global and Kraken in the second and third positions, respectively, for whale inflows, though their volumes are substantially lower than Binance\u2019s.

      "summary": "Cardano has slipped about 1.54% in the past day, but signs are pointing toward a turn in its fortunes. Traders have spotted a rare weekly golden cross on the ADA/USD chart. That happens when a shorter moving average crosses above a longer one. It can signal that buyers are gaining the upper hand after months of sideways action. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In First Ever Weekly Golden Cross According to analyst Mr. Brownstone, Cardano just logged its first\u2011ever weekly golden cross, with the 50\u2011week moving average climbing above the 200\u2011week line. ADA is trading at $0.60, under both its 50\u2011day MA at $0.66 and its 200\u2011day MA at $0.64. That gap means bulls need more firepower to push price back above key levels. Still, the weekly signal has many calling a bullish move ahead. Anyone else notice that Cardano just had it&#8217;s first Weekly Golden Cross ever? \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/d7gvWQfN1Z \u2014 Mr Brownstone (@GunsRoses1987) July 9, 2025 Price Levels To Watch Based on examination from MasterAnanda, ADA will likely need to reclaim its 34\u2011period EMA and the 200\u2011day MA before a real uptrend can take hold. Many traders use those levels as checkpoints. If ADA closes above $0.64, it could draw new buyers in. On the flip side, a drop under $0.59 might trigger more selling pressure. Whales Return To Accumulate Analyst Ali Martinez has noted that large holders scooped up about 120 million ADA over the past two weeks. These addresses, each holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA, now control roughly 5.5 billion ADA\u2014worth around $3.3 billion at current prices. When big wallets pile in, it often suggests confidence that prices will head higher. But it can also lead to quick flips if whales decide to take profits.

Some analysts expect ADA to climb to $1.33, while others think $10 is within reach this cycle. Price prediction by CoinCodex points to a 25% rise to $0.74 by August 8, 2025. Right now, technical indicators lean bearish, and the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at 59 (Neutral). Cardano has seen 14 out of the last 30 days end in green, with volatility around 7.54%, according to the price prediction site. Related Reading: 2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands \u2014 But Who Is He? Outlook And Next Steps Cardano\u2019s weekly golden cross is a bullish sign, but price still needs to clear shorter\u2011term hurdles. Traders looking for confirmation may wait for ADA to close above $0.66 on the daily chart. Those already in position might set a stop\u2011loss below $0.59 to guard against a rejection. With whale activity back on the rise and long\u2011term targets ranging from $1.33 to $10, Cardano is once again on investors\u2019 radar. However, broader market trends\u2014especially moves in Bitcoin\u2014will likely dictate whether ADA\u2019s momentum can stick. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"
