      "summary": "Solana (SOL) has retested a crucial resistance level after recovering the $150 level over the weekend. The surge, fueled by the upcoming launch of a SOL-based staked exchange-traded fund (ETF), has led some analysts to forecast a rally toward the next key target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move Solana Staked ETFs Coming On Wednesday On Monday, Solana\u2019s price soared to a key resistance level following the introduction of \u201cthe first-ever Solana staked crypto ETF in the US.\u201d Rex Shares announced it will launch a Solana-based staked ETF this Wednesday, aiming to offer exposure to SOL and staking rewards. According to the X post, the REX-Osprey ETF will track SOL\u2019s performance while \u201cgenerating yield through on-chain staking,\u201d starting a \u201cnew era of yield-generating crypto exposure.\u201d As a result, Solana climbed to the $160 barrier, which led to nearly $9 million in short positions liquidated on Monday afternoon. Market Watcher Daan Crypto Trades considers Solana \u201cbounced nicely over the weekend\u201d but has yet to turn the Low Timeframe (LTF) trend around. He explained that reclaiming the $159-$167 area is necessary to aim for higher levels. Additionally, the Daily 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are currently located within this range. \u201cI would want to see price trade back above that to start targeting the $180-$200 region again,\u201d he detailed. Nonetheless, the trader questioned whether a Solana spot ETF-driven rally will fuel the cryptocurrency\u2019s run. Notably, multiple investment firms, including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot SOL ETF in the US. According to recent reports, the investment products have a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of being approved in the coming weeks, which has seemingly fueled investors\u2019 expectations of a bullish \u201cSolana Summer.\u201d \u201cThe big question is how much demand there will be,\u201d Daan asserted, noting that Ethereum (ETH) sport ETFs, approved in July 2024, had a disappointing launch and \u201conly started seeing decent inflows about a year later.\u201d SOL Ready For Another Breakout? Following the ETF-fueled breakout, analyst Hardy noted Solana\u2019s \u201cTextbook move, clean breakout, clean retest, and pump,\u201d which could trigger a run toward the $200 barrier. Notably, the cryptocurrency saw a remarkable performance over the weekend, reclaiming the $144-$148 crucial area and breaking past the $150 mark. Amid this performance, the analyst highlighted that Solana had broken out of its local downtrend line after reclaiming the $148 resistance and was retesting the breakout zone. He explained that there is \u201cJuicy liquidity sitting above, ready to be taken,\u201d adding that Solana needed to hold the $150 support to continue its bullish run toward the next target.

      "summary": "Ethereum currently has strong support at $2,200, but one analyst has pointed out that if the level fails, the next region to watch could be $1,160. On-Chain Data Shows Strong Ethereum Demand Zone Near $2,200 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where support lies for Ethereum based on on-chain data. In on-chain analysis, levels are considered as major support/resistance zones if they host the cost basis or acquisition level of a significant part of the ETH supply. The reason behind this lies in the fact that investors are more likely to show some kind of reaction when the retest of their break-even level takes place. This buying/selling is irrelevant to the wider market if only a few holders are having it tested at once, but the story can be different when the retest is of the cost basis of a large amount of them. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the different price levels around the current Ethereum spot price are currently looking in terms of the amount of supply that was purchased at them. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the amount of Ethereum supply contained within the associated price range. It would appear that, out of the ranges listed, the $2,218 to $2,396 levels currently have the largest dot, meaning that they host the most supply. More specifically, this range has the cost basis of 6.28 million addresses, who purchased a total of 67.2 million ETH at its levels. Given this fact, it&#8217;s possible that should a retest of the range occur, investors could show a strong reaction. But what kind of reaction would it be, buying or selling? Well, these investors are in profit right now and usually, such holders are more likely to double down on the asset during declines to their acquisition mark, as they may believe the same price level would turn out to be profitable again in the future. As such, the $2,218 to $2,396 range could end up acting as a strong support level for Ethereum. In the scenario that ETH falls below the lower end of the range around $2,200, however, it may have to rely on support elsewhere. Related Reading: XRP Down 3% After SEC Settlement Stalls, But Social Media Turns Bullish From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that all the ranges below are much smaller in terms of supply. The next major support zone lies all the way down at $1,160, where 35.9 million addresses acquired 21.58 million tokens. Naturally, Ethereum doesn&#8217;t have to slip right through to this zone if $2,200 is lost, but if the data is to go by, it does suggest that the coin could have a harder time regaining footing below it.

ADA price started a fresh decline below $0.5820 and $0.5750. The price is trading above $0.560 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5640 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it dips below the $0.5560 support zone. Cardano Price Fails To Extend Gains In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.590 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA declined below the $0.580 level and trimmed most gains. The bears pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5567 swing low to the $0.5902 high.

The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5567 swing low to the $0.5902 high. Cardano price is now trading above $0.5650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5735 zone. The first resistance is near $0.5820. The next key resistance might be $0.590. If there is a close above the $0.590 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.620 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.6350 in the near term. More Losses In ADA? If Cardano\u2019s price fails to climb above the $0.5820 resistance level, it could start another decline.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-market-enters-caution-zone-amid-rising-sell-side-pressure-analyst-says/",
      "summary": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded slight gains over the past month &#8211; up 3.6% in the last 30 days &#8211; the leading cryptocurrency is experiencing a lack of Apparent Demand, indicating broader market weakness that could lead to a price slump in the near term. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Enters Negative Territory According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin\u2019s new buyer demand is failing to absorb the combined supply pressure from freshly mined BTC and selling from long-term holders (LTHs). As a result, BTC\u2019s Apparent Demand has turned negative. The analyst noted that the imbalance between buyer demand and excessive supply has created a high-risk environment for a near-term price correction. Notably, the $100,000 level remains an important support for the flagship digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weak Hands Exit While Smart Money Loads Up \u2013 Is A Breakout Near? For the uninitiated, Bitcoin\u2019s Apparent Demand measures the balance between new buying interest and the supply of coins entering the market from miners and LTHs selling. When this metric turns negative, it means that the amount of BTC being sold exceeds new purchases, indicating potential market weakness and downward price pressure. BTC entering negative Apparent Demand territory can be considered a bearish development for two key reasons. First, it directly increases the \u201cfor sale\u201d BTC supply, exerting downward pressure on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. Second, significant selling by LTHs &#8211; often considered seasoned and sophisticated investors &#8211; suggests that experienced players believe the crypto market has likely reached a local top and are exiting before a potential severe market downturn. The analyst added: Consequently, the market is in a vulnerable state. Any price rallies from here will likely struggle to overcome this wave of available supply, and market support may be weaker than anticipated. While not a guarantee, this on-chain signal strongly suggests a period of caution is warranted until demand shows clear signs of recovery. That said, recent on-chain analysis indicates a more optimistic outlook. According to fellow CryptoQuant analyst Avocado_onchain, the 30-day moving average (MA) of Bitcoin Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) shows signs of healthy consolidation rather than a potential local top. Some Positive Signs For BTC While BTC\u2019s Apparent Demand might be drying up, easing global geopolitical tensions could catalyze a rally in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Further positive macroeconomic developments may also benefit BTC, potentially leading to a cycle top much higher than currently anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K\u2013$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest Another indicator negating the possibility of a major price pullback is the steadily rising short-term holder (STH) floor price, which has surged to as high as $98,000 according to the latest on-chain data.
