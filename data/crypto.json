      "summary": "Solana has broken down decisively, losing a critical support level following news that the United States launched an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. The unexpected geopolitical development triggered widespread panic across financial markets, with altcoins taking the hardest hit. Solana, in particular, has seen significant selling pressure, dropping 20% from its May high of approximately $185 and now trading near $148. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move This breakdown confirms investor concerns that SOL&#8217;s uptrend has weakened. Top analyst Carl Runefelt noted that Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern\u2014a bearish technical structure often signaling deeper downside. The price has broken below the neckline of this pattern, confirming the potential for continued declines in the short term. Adding to the bearish outlook is Solana&#8217;s inability to reclaim its prior support levels during brief bounces. With momentum indicators turning negative and broader market sentiment rattled, the likelihood of a swift recovery appears slim unless macro conditions stabilize. Solana Faces Deeper Correction As Bearish Pattern Unfolds Solana\u2019s bullish momentum from late 2024 has all but faded, replaced by stagnation and sharp corrections as market conditions worsen. Now trading more than 50% below its all-time high, SOL continues to struggle under the weight of global macroeconomic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions. The US military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities has only added to the volatility, sending shockwaves through both traditional and crypto markets. While Solana was one of the strongest performers during the previous cycle, its price action has turned decisively bearish in recent weeks. Bulls have failed to maintain critical support levels, and the asset has now broken below its short-term trend structures. According to Runefelt, Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern, a classic technical signal that often precedes a prolonged downtrend. The pattern\u2019s neckline has been breached, and the projected bearish target now stands around $106.30\u2014a level not seen since February. The breakdown also reflects broader weakness in the altcoin market. Despite earlier hopes for an altseason, capital has rotated out of risk assets, favoring Bitcoin and stablecoins amid uncertainty. Solana&#8217;s inability to reclaim prior highs or establish higher lows points to a market in retreat. Momentum indicators continue to flash red, and unless bulls reclaim lost ground quickly, SOL could be facing an extended period of consolidation or further losses. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates SOL Price Analysis: Breaking Below Key Support Solana is under pressure as it breaks below the critical 200-day simple moving average (SMA) around $149.54, a level that had previously acted as dynamic support. This breakdown signals growing bearish sentiment as price action confirms a loss of momentum following weeks of consolidation below the $155\u2013$160 resistance zone. As of now, SOL is trading at approximately $135.99, down nearly 3% on the day and over 20% from its May highs. The chart shows a rejection near the 100-day SMA (green line), and the sustained move below both the 200-day and 50-day SMAs (blue line) points to a shifting structure, leaning heavily toward the downside. Volume remains elevated on red candles, confirming that the breakdown is supported by increasing sell pressure rather than a low-liquidity move. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason If the current trend continues, Solana could revisit the $120\u2013$125 range, which previously served as strong support in early Q1 2025. The broader context of macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tension, particularly the recent U.S. attack on Iran, adds to investor unease across risk assets, including altcoins like Solana. A daily close back above $149 would be needed to neutralize the short-term bearish structure and shift sentiment. Until then, downside risks dominate.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-slips-beneath-102000-heres-the-next-support/",
      "summary": "The Bitcoin price had a tough start to the weekend, plummeting from its $106,000 high to just above $103,000 on Friday, June 20. The flagship cryptocurrency became somewhat stable above this price zone, hovering around the $104,000 mark for most of the past day. However, the Bitcoin price faced another wave of bearish pressure in the late hours of Saturday, June 21, falling to around $101,500 as a result. Below is an analysis of the BTC price and what lies ahead for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Next BTC Support Level Lies At $100,000: Analyst Popular crypto analyst with the pseudonym Titan of Crypto put forward an interesting analysis for the Bitcoin price as the market leader struggles to build any momentum. According to the online pundit, the price of BTC could be on its way to retest a crucial support area if it continues to lose its bullish impetus. Related Reading: Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Enters Deep Red On Binance \u2014 What\u2019s Next For BTC Price? Using the Bitcoin price chart on the weekly timeframe, the next significant support level lies around the $99,000 \u2013 $100,000 range. The confluence of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) and the rising Tenkan-sen (red line) around this price region makes the zone a significant area to watch if selling pressure persists. The Tenkan-sen, a key component of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, is often considered a significant line in analyzing short-term trends. The Tenkan-sen line is often seen as a key support and resistance level, as well as a signal line for potential trend reversals. The Fair Value Gap is a liquidity void often created by a sharp movement in price, indicating a lack of trading activity within a particular price range. FVGs are usually considered as potential regions of interest for future price corrections, as investors often look to fill the liquidity void. With the FVG and the Tenkan-sen set within this same region, Titan of Crypto noted that the Bitcoin price may find a support cushion around the $100,000. This level appears to be extremely crucial for the flagship cryptocurrency in the short term, especially as its bullish momentum wanes. Meanwhile, holding above this $100,000 support could be critical to Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trajectory. It is worth noting that the price of BTC has not traded beneath $100,000 since May 8, reaching the $110,000 mark twice within that span. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After falling to around $101,400 in the late hours of Saturday, the price of Bitcoin has now returned around $103,000. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $102,845, reflecting a 0.4% decline in the past 24 hours.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-weekly-chart-nears-tower-top-formation-as-us-launches-attack-on-iran-details/",
      "summary": "Ethereum has officially broken below the long-standing range it had maintained since early May, losing the critical $2,320 support level. This breakdown was triggered by escalating geopolitical tensions, as news broke that the United States had launched attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The announcement sent shockwaves through global markets, sparking widespread risk-off behavior and panic selling across crypto. Ethereum, already trading near the bottom of its six-week consolidation range, quickly reacted with a sharp drop, dragging the broader altcoin market with it. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels \u2013 Here\u2019s Why The move marks a critical shift in sentiment, as Ethereum now trades outside the range that had served as a battleground between bulls and bears for over a month. With volatility spiking and confidence shaken, traders are re-evaluating risk in light of escalating conflict in the Middle East and broader macroeconomic headwinds. According to top analyst Big Cheds, Ethereum&#8217;s weekly chart is now flirting with a potential tower top pattern completion \u2014 a bearish reversal structure that may signal further downside unless buyers reclaim key levels in the coming days. As the situation evolves, all eyes will remain on ETH\u2019s ability to hold new support levels or risk further decline in a fragile market environment. Ethereum Slides 22% From June Highs \u2013 All Eyes On Weekly Structure Ethereum has lost over 22% of its value since peaking in early June, as global instability and heightened selling pressure weigh heavily on market sentiment. The asset has now broken below its six-week range, triggering concern among investors and adding to uncertainty across the broader crypto space. With rising tensions in the Middle East\u2014particularly following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities\u2014the market has entered a risk-off environment, dragging altcoins like Ethereum into deeper retracements. Despite the volatility, Ethereum remains at the center of investor focus, as many still expect it to lead the next altseason. However, with bulls losing control of key support zones, confidence in a near-term rally continues to waver. Analysts are now split: while some predict a deeper retracement toward the $2,000 region, others argue that Ethereum is nearing exhaustion on the downside and may soon recover. Big Cheds points to Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart, where the price is currently flirting with a potential tower top pattern\u2014a bearish reversal structure. If this pattern confirms, ETH may face another wave of downside before finding demand at lower supply levels. If buyers step in during this pivotal moment, a recovery from this structure could quickly follow. The coming sessions will be critical in determining whether this breakdown extends or turns into a fakeout with bullish continuation. For now, traders should remain cautious, as Ethereum&#8217;s next move could define the tone of the altcoin market heading into July. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates Ethereum Breaks Down Below Support As Volatility Spikes Ethereum has officially broken below the $2,320 support level, signaling a shift in short-term market structure as shown in the 4-hour chart. After weeks of ranging between $2,320 and $2,650, ETH failed to reclaim its moving averages and lost bullish momentum. The price is now trading around $2,260, down sharply from its June highs near $2,900. This recent leg down follows a clean breakdown through the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs, confirming a strong bearish momentum. Volume spikes accompanied the drop, suggesting panic selling likely triggered by geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East. The price broke down aggressively with little resistance, meaning previous demand zones have now become weak. If buyers fail to step in quickly, Ethereum may revisit earlier May support levels around $2,100 or even $2,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move From a technical standpoint, the breakdown invalidates the previous consolidation range, opening the door for a possible extended correction. Until ETH reclaims $2,320 and stabilizes above its moving averages, the risk of continued downside remains high. Market participants should watch closely for volume shifts or bullish divergences, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure as uncertainty continues to dominate the macro environment. The next few sessions will be crucial for price discovery. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-on-chain-activity-down-80-in-5-months-experts-argue-bullish-bearish-implications/",
      "summary": "XRP\u2019s on-chain metrics are reportedly painting a foreboding picture for its price outlook, as data shows a steep 80% decline in new wallet creation over the past five months. This drop in network activity has sparked divided opinions between two expert analysts, with one casting doubts on XRP\u2019s ability to reclaim the $3 mark, and the other rejecting such bearish predictions. XRP Price Surge To $3 Stalled In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst the \u2018Coin Bureau\u2019 highlights that XRP\u2019s momentum appears to be fading fast as new on-chain data from Glassnode reveals a staggering 80% drop in wallet creation since January 2025. This sharp decline in network activity and growth has led the analyst to claim that the XRP price is unlikely to revisit the $3 level anytime soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits\u2014Analyst Reveals Key Insight At the height of XRP\u2019s 2024 rally, both its price and user activity surged in tandem. During that time, new wallet addresses soared to nearly 30,000 per day in November, coinciding with a sharp rally that sent the token\u2019s price surging close to $3. However, the explosive rally proved short-lived, as momentum faded and prices have since reversed. As of mid-June 2025, Glassnode chart shows that new wallet creation has fallen drastically to around 2,000-5,000 per day, while daily active addresses plunged from 577,000 to just 34,000. XRP\u2019s price, meanwhile, has settled just above $2 and has remained largely range-bound, failing to show signs of a sustained breakout. According to Coin Bureau, this significant drop in on-chain engagement indicates that interest in XRP may have dried up, removing one of the key drivers behind its previous rally. Without new users entering the ecosystem or existing ones increasing XRP\u2019s on-chain activity, the analyst warns that the conditions necessary for an immediate $3 price reclaim aren\u2019t present. Analyst Debunks Bearish Forecast While Coin Bureau\u2019s data paints a picture of declining interest and slow price growth, one crypto expert, known as Moon Lambo on X, has pushed back against the bearish narrative. He argues that XRP\u2019s network activity actually reflects growing strength and long-term confidence. The chart presented by the analyst, covering wallet creation data from June 2024 to June 2025, shows an undeniable spike in network activity between November and early January\u2014a surge that peaked during a period of heightened market enthusiasm following the US elections.
