      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/a-rare-bitcoin-signal-is-flashing-could-the-bull-run-just-be-getting-started/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin&#8217;s market price has experienced renewed downward pressure, falling to just under $106,000 in the last 24 hours. This marks a 1.8% dip over the past day and places the asset approximately 6% below its all-time high of over $111,000 reached last month. While the correction is not severe compared to historical volatility, it highlights ongoing uncertainty in the market as BTC consolidates near record highs without sustained upward momentum. One metric drawing attention amid this price movement is the Puell Multiple, a tool used to evaluate whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to miner income. Related Reading: Bitcoin\u2019s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed\u2014Next Stop: $170,000 Bitcoin Puell Multiple Suggests Miner Revenues Have Yet to Catch Up CryptoQuant analyst Gaah highlighted that while prices recently surged above $108,000, the Puell Multiple remains below 1.40, a level typically associated with discounted or non-euphoric market phases. This decoupling between BTC price and miner revenue offers insight into how recent gains may be more demand-driven than organically supported by on-chain mining fundamentals. The Puell Multiple measures the daily issuance of BTC in USD terms relative to its 365-day moving average. Historically, readings below 1.0 are seen during market bottoms or accumulation phases, indicating undervaluation. Gaah points out that current readings hovering around 1.40 suggest miner profitability is still lagging, even as the asset trades near historic highs. This pattern contrasts with previous bull cycles where high prices were often accompanied by elevated miner earnings, driven by both network activity and block rewards. This disparity may be due in part to the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. While halving events typically drive price appreciation through reduced supply, they simultaneously put downward pressure on miner revenue. In this case, despite a climb in market price, the halving\u2019s impact continues to suppress income for miners, implying that the price increase has not yet been accompanied by the kind of broader economic expansion that would traditionally drive a full-fledged bull market. Potential for Continued Growth as Institutional Forces Drive Demand Gaah also points to the possibility that external factors may be playing a more dominant role in driving recent price action. These include increasing institutional inflows through spot Bitcoin ETFs, as well as a tighter circulating supply as long-term holders reduce active selling. These forces could be supporting price without necessarily boosting miner profitability in the short term, especially if the uptick is concentrated in secondary market demand rather than new BTC issuance. The current environment may signal a unique window for participants analyzing Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation. A high market price combined with conservative fundamentals suggests the market is not yet in a speculative excess phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? If miner revenues eventually rise in line with growing demand, driven by either increased transaction fees or broader network usage, it could support further upside. As such, both technical and fundamental indicators may continue to evolve in the coming months, offering a clearer view of whether the current cycle has more room to run.

      "summary": "A fresh XRP/BTC chart released on 12 June by the market technician known as Dr. Cat has injected new controversy into one of crypto\u2019s most stubborn trading pairs. The analyst, posting to X, argues that despite a bruising six-week slide, conditions still favour an eventual breakout for XRP that would leave Bitcoin lagging. He assigns the scenario a formidable 70 percent probability. XRP Vs. Bitcoin: 70% Chance Of Breakout, But When? At the heart of Dr. Cat\u2019s thesis is the 2,041-satoshi level, where three separate Ichimoku timeframes\u2014monthly, bi-monthly and tri-monthly\u2014intersect. \u201cThe price keeps eating support after support with no reaction from bulls at all as if supports don\u2019t exist,\u201d he concedes, but he stresses that this specific shelf is \u201cthe most important support.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Could Crash To $1.55 Before Explosive Surge, Analyst Warns Candles on the attached one-month chart already hover fractionally below the line; a decisive monthly close beneath it, he warns, would flip the three-day structure fully bearish and scatter the pair into unpredictable, possibly chaotic ranges. Even so, the strategist insists history is on the side of XRP bulls. \u201cPrice has spent years performing very well and coiling up with higher lows for this attack now,\u201d he writes, framing the past twelve quarters as a prolonged accumulation that has never surrendered its series of macro higher lows. That coiling, he believes, will allow XRP to mount at least a \u201cminor \u2026 attack in August\u201d toward the 3,000-satoshi region\u2014roughly a 45 percent appreciation from current levels\u2014and perhaps fuel a &#8220;much bigger attack&#8221; once the broader market cycle matures. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The optimism is not unqualified. Dr. Cat calculates a 30 percent chance of a complete flop if 2,041 sats fails on a monthly-close basis. Under that bearish branch, the cross could slice toward 1,800 \u2013 1,900 sats, attempt a feeble rebound, or continue a \u201cslow bleed all the way down to the bottom of the range where it started the monster move.\u201d In such a setback, he would not expect the long-anticipated \u201cmonster bullish move\u201d until Q4 2025 at the earliest. For the moment, therefore, the market hangs on a single number. Hold above 2,041 and Dr. Cat sees a clear shot at outperforming Bitcoin\u2014first modestly, then dramatically. Slip beneath it, and the road map dissolves into what he bluntly calls an \u201cunpredictable/choppy\u201d expanse. Either way, XRP traders now know exactly where the cycle\u2019s pivot resides and precisely how thin the margin for error has become. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1287.

      "summary": "The Shiba Inu development crew has rolled out a new tech layer that could shift how people use SHIB. According to reports, the beta version of Shib Alpha Layer went live on June 12, 2025. It\u2019s made in partnership with ElderLabs, and it got built without any VC backing. Now users can test it before the full launch. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Shib Alpha Layer Beta Launch Based on reports, the Shib Alpha Layer brings all the separate rollups in the ecosystem under one hood. You won\u2019t need to jump from bridge to bridge. You transact as if you\u2019re on a single chain, even though dozens of rollups run beneath the surface. The project reached beta in record time, and the team says they did it all with their own funds. User Friendly Experience Users can pay fees in SHIB, BONE, or any token they hold. That cuts out the problem of having to swap tokens just to cover gas. You\u2019ll also get near\u2011instant finality, so transactions show up almost right away. Those features may seem small, but they could pull in people who find current rollup setups clunky and slow. Shiba Inu: Security And Privacy Features Shib Alpha Layer uses ZAMA\u2019s Fully Homomorphic Encryption. That lets smart contracts run on encrypted data, so the logic stays private. It\u2019s rare to see FHE live in a crypto network, but the beta is already up and running. Security audits have been promised before the public release, which should ease some worries about bugs or hacks. Today we flip the script. For years we\u2019ve been called \u201cjust a meme,\u201d spammed with Wen Shibarium?, and drowned in FUD from bots, burnt deadweight ex-team but instead of arguing, we shipped.

According to lead developer Kaal Dhairya, every rollup becomes an L3 network, picking up the security that Shibarium offers. Future updates will open up rollup deployment to everyone and boost multi\u2011chain links. Instant bridging is on the roadmap, too, so moving assets between chains could happen in a click. READ THIS: https://t.co/zZcjV0VhHv \u2014 Shytoshi Kusama\u2122 (@ShytoshiKusama) June 13, 2025 The team\u2019s main coder, Kaal Dhairya, pointed out that early critics called SHIB a joke coin. They\u2019d ask \u201cWen Shibarium?\u201d and spread fear, uncertainty and doubt. He said those jibes didn\u2019t slow them down. Instead, they focused on building.

He\u2019s been drafting a whitepaper on how AI could team up with the Shiba Inu network. He also flagged Shiba\u2019s new Web3 gaming push on Astra Nova\u2019s TokenPlay.ai. Calling an end to SHIB\u2019s \u201cmeme era\u201d is a bold claim. But if the new layer works smoothly, it could mark a shift in how people think about Shiba Inu.

      "summary": "After a volatile but bullish start to June, Solana (SOL) is now facing strong selling pressure amid rising global uncertainty. The sudden escalation in the Middle East\u2014triggered by Israel\u2019s recent strike on Iran\u2014has sparked market-wide volatility, prompting a flight to safety and a pullback across risk assets. Solana, which had been showing momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, has dropped over 15% since June 11, erasing much of its early-month gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History \u2013 Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally As macro risks continue to rise, the altcoin market remains vulnerable to further downside. SOL is now approaching a critical technical level, and a breakdown could signal deeper losses if global tensions persist. Top analyst Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now re-testing a key daily demand zone, a level that previously supported bullish continuation. If this area fails to hold, Solana could revisit lower support levels seen earlier this year. For now, traders are watching closely to see if buyers step in to defend the zone or if further conflict will fuel more risk-off behavior. The next few days will be critical in determining whether SOL can bounce or if the broader market downturn intensifies. Solana Re-Tests Key Support As Market Tensions Mount Solana is standing below key levels, retracing after a brief rally attempt earlier this week. The asset had spent several days consolidating beneath the $170 level, failing to break above resistance as selling pressure intensified amid rising global tensions. Now, with the broader market on edge following the Israel\u2013Iran conflict escalation, SOL finds itself back at a critical support zone. Bulls remain cautiously optimistic, encouraged by the broader market\u2019s resilience and the potential for Bitcoin and Ethereum to regain strength. However, caution dominates sentiment as Solana, like most altcoins, still trades significantly below its all-time high near $260. The current environment of geopolitical risk and macroeconomic uncertainty has suppressed momentum in the altcoin space, making support levels all the more important. Cheds highlighted in a recent update that Solana is now re-testing a key daily demand zone around the $145 level. This zone has previously acted as a launchpad for bullish moves, and holding above it could provide the structure needed for a new leg higher. However, failure to maintain this level might open the door for further downside, with the next major support below $130. For now, all eyes are on how Solana reacts around $145. A solid bounce with increased volume could attract short-term buyers looking to ride a potential recovery. But with global markets rattled by uncertainty, the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether this demand zone becomes a springboard\u2014or a trapdoor. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support \u2013 Can Bulls Defend This Level? SOL Price Analysis: Re-Test of Support as Volatility Spikes Solana is currently trading at $145.24 after an aggressive drop from the $165\u2013$170 range. The 4-hour chart shows a clear breakdown below all key moving averages (50, 100, and 200), which had previously served as dynamic support. The red 200 SMA at $165.33 now acts as overhead resistance, capping short-term recovery attempts. The recent sell-off\u2014triggered by broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East\u2014pushed SOL straight into a key demand zone around $143\u2013$145, where buyers have historically stepped in. The long lower wick from today\u2019s candle reflects strong intraday buying at these levels, suggesting that some participants see this as a value zone. However, volume remains elevated, and the structure appears fragile. Any failure to hold $145 could open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $130 region. On the flip side, reclaiming the 100 SMA at $157.46 would be an early sign of renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Momentum indicators likely remain oversold, and if the broader market stabilizes, this level could mark a temporary bottom. Still, with volatility high and macro uncertainty looming, traders may want to stay cautious until a clear direction emerges. For now, $145 is the line in the sand.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-could-rally-to-10000/",
      "summary": "Ethereum&#8217;s price action this week has been very notable, with the leading altcoin breaking above $2,800 again for the first time in four months. Ethereum managed to break above the $2,800 mark for the first time since February, briefly touching $2,870 before pulling back slightly. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 Cycle? Here\u2019s The Target Two separate analyses by crypto strategist Crypto Patel on the social media platform X suggests Ethereum is now on the right track. The first, based on an 8-hour chart, highlights a rally toward $4,000. The second, using a long-term two-week timeframe, outlines a bullish setup that could send Ethereum soaring to $10,000 and beyond. Ethereum\u2019s Breakout From Sideways Consolidation Zone In a recent analysis shared on X, a crypto analyst known as Crypto Patel highlighted Ethereum\u2019s attempt to break out of its established range. Using the 8-hour candlestick chart, he pointed out how the Ethereum had spent many weeks since early May trading between clear support at $2,366 and resistance around $2,734. The breakout seen on the chart occurred just above this resistance zone, when Ethereum briefly pushed past $2,800 before facing some rejection. If this breakout holds above $2,800, Ethereum could initiate a steep upward rally toward the $3,500 to $4,000 region in the coming weeks. Crypto Patel noted the importance of watching whether Ethereum sustains above the $2,750 breakout line, as a successful confirmation could trigger an influx of bullish momentum. Ethereum\u2019s To $10,000 In The Long-Term In a follow-up post analyzing a much larger timeframe, Crypto Patel shared a two-week candlestick chart that mapped Ethereum\u2019s longer-term structure since 2018. The chart revealed a well-defined bullish setup, including a bounce from a key bullish order block around $1,400 in April. This bounce acted as a support level, with the resulting candlestick being a bullish one that broke through another order block between $1,700 and $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Patel pointed out that Ethereum is now showing signs of a long-term bullish continuation pattern. With support levels already locked in for the next bear market, the analyst projected a target above $10,000, citing a 438% upside potential from current price levels. The chart also marks $2,500 as a structural pivot point, with Ethereum\u2019s ongoing upward trajectory expected to strengthen if this support level continues to hold. Therefore, the path to $10,000 will depend on Ethereum\u2019s ability to turn its recent resistance break into sustained momentum. The $2,800 region must now serve as a support base rather than a resistance ceiling. However, this has failed to really materialize in the past 24 hours, as Ethereum is currently down by a massive 9.6%. The ensuing price action has seen the leading altcoin now back trading within this consolidation range. Failure to hold above $2,500 could cascade to more losses over the weekend until it closes on $2,366 again and probably initiate another bounce from here.
