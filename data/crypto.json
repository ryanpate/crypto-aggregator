      "summary": "Bitcoin saw a sharp price dip on Thursday amidst a public fallout between US President Donald Trump and the world&#8217;s richest man Elon Musk. The premier cryptocurrency, which had traded steadily within the $104,000\u2013$106,000 range throughout the week, plunged to below $101,000 as tensions escalated between the two influential figures who attacked each other via their personally owned social media platforms i.e. X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social. Since then, Bitcoin has shown some market resilience climbing back to around $104,000. With another consolidation developing, market analyst Crypto Daan has highlighted the price levels that are critical to the next price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 \u2013 Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Beyond $106K Or Below $100K &#8211; What\u2019s Next For Bitcoin? The month of May proved largely bullish for Bitcoin as the digital asset surged from around $95,000 to establish a new all-time high near $112,000 marking the resumption of the larger crypto bull market. However, Bitcoin has noted a significant price correction since reaching this peak with market prices pegged around $104,000 on May 31. As seen in the first week of June, Bitcoin had hovered around $106,000 before its most recent price slump on Thursday. Due to this price action, Daan Crypto notes the digital asset is now trading within a price range of $100,000-$106,000, where it comfortably sits at the mid-range around $104,000. The analyst notes that if Bitcoin returns break below the lower range boundary at $100,000, the ongoing price correction could extend for 1-2 weeks. Going by BTC\u2019s stairwell ascent in the past month, potential market support in such a bearish case would lie around $95,000 and $85,000. On the other hand, if the market bulls can force a return above the monthly high of $106,000, Daan Crypto explains that such development would indicate the market correction is over, and Bitcoin may be headed for another price discovery with potential initial targets of around $120,000. Related Reading: XRP Wave Structure Predicts Wild Fluctuations On Its Way To $4 ATH BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,650 following a price gain of 2.98% in the past day. Using larger time frames , the premier cryptocurrency is up by 1.12% on its weekly chart and 7.49% on the monthly chart indicating a strong bullish control of the market. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart stands at 51.53 facing upward which supports the notion that Bitcoin\u2019s correction might be over with price eyeing a return to the overbought zone above 70. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency and fifth largest asset in the world. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview"

However, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin will ultimately dictate the move. Keeping a close eye on the intraday chart, the expert mentioned that an early pullback could present a scalp opportunity, as long as Bitcoin aligns with the bullish outlook. Breakout Likely With Strong Daily Candles Breaking down his latest analysis, the trader explained that LINK\u2019s daily candle officially closed bullish, marking a key technical point in the current trend. Meanwhile, LINKBTC ended the session on a positive note, which adds weight to the bullish outlook for LINK in the short term. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level \u2013 $10 Support Back In Focus However, the analyst emphasized that more bullish daily closes on LINKBTC are needed to confirm momentum. A continuation of strength could lead to an impulsive breakout above the daily candle\u2019s lower high trendline, igniting the next leg upward. A decisive move above the 0.000140 BTC resistance zone is expected to accelerate price action for LINK, giving bulls a clear signal to push higher. If momentum continues to build, LINK could rally toward the $16 resistance level, marking a major target for the current setup. For now, $12.50 remains a key support level on the daily timeframe and will act as a cushion if bearish pressure reemerges. Looking ahead, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Dominance will remain the primary market drivers for Chainlink heading into the weekend. While maintaining a rational outlook, CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor LINK\u2019s intraday chart closely for any developing setups. Awaiting Chainlink Next Trade Setup In conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD emphasized that LINK\u2019s intraday chart is showing signs of a bullish recovery, closely aligned with Bitcoin\u2019s recent rebound. He expressed optimism that further upside is likely if current conditions persist, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its strength. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support \u2013 Is A New Breakout Imminent? Despite the encouraging signs, CRYPTOWZRD noted that a temporary bearish pullback would be both natural and healthy within the current market context. Pullbacks often reset market conditions, providing better structure for stronger continuation patterns. He believes such a retracement could offer a favorable early entry point for long positions, especially for short-term or intraday traders looking to capitalize on the volatility. As the market continues to evolve, CRYPTOWZRD advises traders to wait for clear confirmation of the next trade setup before taking action. His statement emphasized that strategic patience will be key in identifying the most rewarding opportunities. For now, traders should track price behavior closely and prepare to act swiftly when the next valid entry signal presents itself. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "The Bitcoin market was recently subject to a significant price dip as a public feud between US President Donald Trump and the world&#8217;s richest man, Elon Musk, on Thursday negatively impacted the US financial markets. During this period, the premier cryptocurrency crashed by an estimated 5% from $106,000 to trade below $101,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term volatility, several key technical indicators now point to a potentially bullish setup. In fact, this latest pullback appears to complete a series of signals that historically precede major price rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance \u2013 A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Bitcoin Set For Price Surge, First Target At $130,000 In an X post on June 6, a market expert with X username CrypFlow shares a bullish Bitcoin prediction amidst an ongoing price correction. Aside from sharp price decline in the past week, the BTC market has witnessed a steady price correction since the premier cryptocurrency achieved a new-all time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, CrypFlow states that this price retracement alongside a host of other technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is setting to repeat its price rally from Q4 2024. The first indicator observed by the analyst in the chart above is the golden cross which occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (50SMA) crosses above the 200-day simple moving average (200SMA) in early June 2025. The golden cross is a common bullish indicator that signals a shift in market momentum and was last seen in November 2024. Furthermore, there is a Bitcoin price breakout above a long-standing purple downward trendline that originated in December 2024. This breakout also mirrors another move seen in early November 2024, when BTC breached the descending resistance that began in March 2024. The ongoing price correction represents the final indicator as Bitcoin also suffered an estimated 10% price fall in November falling from $74,500 to $68,500 before initially an explosive price rally. CrypFlow\u2019s analysis suggests that if Bitcoin is repeating its price rally from Q4 2024, the premier cryptocurrency could produce a 62% price gain translating into potential targets around $170,000. However, the analyst has set a more conservative initial price target of $130,000, representing a 25% gain from current market levels.

According to data from prediction site Coincodex, the general BTC market sentiment remains bullish despite a Fear &#38; Greed Index of 45 which indicates Fear.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/his-bitcoin-top-signal-hasnt-gone-off-yet/",
      "summary": "The story has been somewhat the same for the price of Bitcoin over the past week, drifting further from its recently-notched all-time high of $111,814. On Friday, June 6, the premier cryptocurrency fell towards the $101,000 level, reflecting an uptick in the market volatility over the past few days. While the Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from this sudden downturn, there is still real concern about the market leader\u2019s performance since reaching its record-high value. However, a new indicator suggests that the price of BTC might still have some time to run up to a new high. Analyst Predicts Four Months Of Opportunity For BTC In a recent post on the X platform, crypto expert Joao Wedson revealed that there might still be some degree of opportunity in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on a model, which was accurate in predicting past all-time high prices for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows This revelation is based on the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the tops of past Bitcoin cycles. According to Wedson\u2019s post, this cycle top prediction model suggests that the price of BTC could still have around four months of upward growth potential \u2014 regardless of the volatility and market shakeout. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin reaches its current cycle peak whenever the Max Intersect SMA (simple moving average) hits the previous cycle top. In the 2021 cycle, the top prediction model hit the 2018 high of around $19,000 in November 2021, culminating in a then-all-time high of $69,000. Hence, when this Max Intersect SMA hits exactly $69,000 \u2014 the price top in the last cycle, that will represent the peak of this current cycle. Wedson also asserted that this model is pretty reliable, as it is backed by 200 tested algorithms. With this top prediction model still a bit off $69,000, the Bitcoin price might still be some months away from its peak. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As mentioned earlier, the price of BTC seems to be struggling after recently hitting its current all-time high above the $110,000 mark. This week\u2019s performance must have tested investors\u2019 patience as the flagship cryptocurrency mostly traded within a consolidation range.

      "summary": "The Bitcoin price has continued to trade sideways since hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,900 earlier in May. Amid the current price action, crypto analyst Decode has provided insights into whether the leading crypto will rally to $120,000 or drop below $100,000 next. Analyst Reveals What&#8217;s Next For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Decode shared an accompanying chart in which he made an ABC wave analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, the leading crypto is expected to drop below $100,000 before it rallies to a new ATH of $120,000. The chart showed that BTC could fall to as low as $96,500 on the Wave B corrective move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next This drop to $96,500 is expected to happen this month. Once that is done, Decode predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally above $120,500 before the end of July. This will mark the Wave C impulsive move to the upside. This aligns with veteran trader Peter Brandt\u2019s prediction that BTC could reach as high as $150,000 by late summer. However, crypto analyst KillaXBT has predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit the $120,000 target by mid-June. This coincides with the June FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18. A Fed rate cut could serve as the catalyst for such a parabolic rally from the current BTC price level. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 97.4% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged. As such, market participants aren\u2019t expecting a rate cut, which is why the Bitcoin price could pump massively if Jerome Powell and the FOMC were to surprise everyone. Moreover, US President Donald Trump yesterday urged the Fed to cut rates by a full point. A Breakout Might Be On The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that a breakout could be imminent for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is progressing inside a 4-hour falling wedge, which indicates a bullish reversal pattern. If confirmed, the analyst stated that the breakout could target the $107,500 and $109,500 zones, which are the Fibonacci confluence areas. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the solid V-shape recovery for the Bitcoin price after the leading crypto dropped to as low as $100,000 on May 5. However, the analyst noted that BTC\u2019s rebound back to the $105,000 zone won\u2019t matter until it breaks above the $106,800 level. The leading crypto must also show actual follow-through with 3-day to 1-week closes to support a breakout. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,000.
