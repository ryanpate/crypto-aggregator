      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-charts-rare-signal-not-seen-in-years/",
      "summary": "In his latest macro-technical analysis, crypto strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) has flagged a potentially pivotal moment for Ethereum (ETH), arguing that a confluence of rare monthly chart signals\u2014some not seen in years\u2014could be laying the groundwork for durable altcoin outperformance. Speaking in a video posted June 9, the analyst described the current Ethereum setup across multiple timeframes as \u201csomething we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d drawing comparisons to historical signals that preceded major rallies in 2016, 2018, and 2020. Ethereum Primed For Macro Breakout Kevin emphasized that Ethereum now exhibits strong bullish momentum across its USD pair, dominance chart, and ETH/BTC ratio, pointing to a simultaneous alignment of several high-time frame indicators. \u201cThese are things that just don\u2019t pop up every day,\u201d he said. \u201cMatter of fact, these are things that have almost never popped up in such confluence throughout history for Ethereum.\u201d The core of Kevin\u2019s thesis hinges on what he calls a \u201cmonthly demand candle\u201d\u2014a large, typically green candlestick that emerges after a protracted correction. Ethereum printed such a candle in May 2025 following nearly a year of sideways chop and five months of drawdown. Historically, these demand candles have marked the start of significant uptrends. Kevin cited analogous structures in 2016, 2018, and during the COVID-19 crash in 2020, all of which preceded multi-month rallies. \u201cThis may be the most textbook demand candle we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he noted, adding that \u201cthe last time we saw something like this was before ETH ran for nearly a year with barely any major correction.\u201d Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Supporting the candle analysis is a synchronized bullish turn in several technical indicators. The Market Cipher momentum wave has clipped into the oversold zone and printed a confirmed green dot buy signal. Simultaneously, the VWAP\u2014volume-weighted average price\u2014has crossed above the zero line, and money flow has started to trend upward. Kevin was explicit about the importance of this configuration: \u201cLet me tell you something: this is a big deal.\u201d The monthly RSI, currently sitting at 51, has not yet broken the crucial 70-level that historically marks the onset of parabolic price action. According to Kevin, \u201cETH has never even broken 70 this cycle. You haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s possible yet for Ethereum\u2014or for altcoins in general. You\u2019ve seen nothing yet.\u201d He also highlighted the return of whale accumulation, measured through a proprietary \u201cwhale money flow\u201d indicator. After exiting ETH positions for over a year\u2014from March 2024 to May 2025\u2014whale flows have shown a V-shaped bottom and are now turning up. \u201cWe are now starting to see accumulation durably here,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cYou keep hearing that BlackRock&#8217;s buying ETH, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s reflected in this indicator, but we are definitely seeing whale activity occur on the monthly time frame.\u201d The analyst went further, showing that Ethereum\u2019s stock RSI on the monthly timeframe has not only bottomed out but is now rebounding sharply\u2014a pattern that historically precedes long-duration uptrends. \u201cThis is aggressive movement,\u201d he explained, noting that for confirmation, the RSI still needs to cross the 20-level, but emphasized that the current shape of the rebound is stronger than in previous cycles. Ethereum Shows Relative Strength Another key piece of the puzzle is Ethereum\u2019s dominance chart, which tracks ETH\u2019s market cap relative to the rest of the crypto space excluding Bitcoin. Kevin pointed to a potential double bottom on the monthly chart and a newly confirmed MACD momentum shift, the first in over two years. \u201cThat\u2019s two years and one month of downtrend finally reversing,\u201d he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds \u2013 Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Finally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing a near-identical structure to Ethereum\u2019s dominance chart. Kevin believes this confluence is key. \u201cLook at that\u2014wow, that\u2019s funny\u2014it looks the same. You find your major low right where you found it in 2020. The monthly indicators are all curling up.\u201d Still, he remained measured in his optimism, noting that macroeconomic conditions\u2014particularly monetary policy\u2014remain essential for confirming the bullish case. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some monetary policy shifting. We still need inflation to come in line. But the market is living four to six months ahead. If the market starts to sniff out that easing is coming, we\u2019ll see that reflected in asset prices before it happens.\u201d Referencing cycle theory and historical post-halving performance, Kevin argued that ETH\u2019s recent relative strength fits both narratives. \u201cTypically, ETH and altcoins start to outperform Bitcoin in"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/toncoin-ton-toward-40-breakout-pattern-suggest/",
      "summary": "An analyst has pointed out how Toncoin (TON) is currently trading inside a Triangle pattern that could potentially set the stage up for a 40% move. Toncoin Has Been Stuck Inside A Triangle On The Daily Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that Toncoin has recently been moving inside. The pattern in question is a Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which forms when an asset&#8217;s price observes consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. Three popular ones include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines relative to each other defines which type a particular triangular channel falls under. In an Ascending Triangle, the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis. This means that as the price travels inside the pattern, its consolidation shrinks toward a net upside. The Descending Triangle involves just the opposite case; the upper line is sloped downward while the lower one is flat. The third variation, the Symmetrical Triangle, has its trendlines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In this pattern, the price&#8217;s range tightens to a point in a sideways manner. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle pattern that Toncoin has seemingly been trapped within during the past few months: From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Triangle that the 1-day price of Toncoin has been following looks similar to a Symmetrical Triangle, but it&#8217;s not a perfect one; there is a slight bias to the downside. The cryptocurrency most recently found support at the lower line and has since climbed toward the midway point between the trendlines. The coin&#8217;s price is now not too far from the apex of the pattern. Generally, breakouts become more likely as consolidation becomes tighter, so it&#8217;s possible that TON may be approaching one. According to the analyst, a breakout, if it happens, could potentially end up leading to a 40% move for Toncoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Ethereum Diverge\u2014ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative As for which direction a breakout might take the asset in, Symmetrical Triangles usually have both sides at equal probability. Since the Triangle in the current case is slightly angled down, however, an exit below the lower line may be a bit more likely. It now remains to be seen how Toncoin&#8217;s price will develop in the coming days and if the pattern will play any role. TON Price At the time of writing, Toncoin is trading around $3.3, up over 2% in the last seven days. Featured image from Shutterstock.com, charts from TradingView.com"

      "summary": "According to crypto entrepreneur Edoardo Farina, most individual XRP holders could find themselves shut out as inflation and tight budgets squeeze their options. He argues that owning more than 10,000 XRP \u2013 which costs about $23,100 at a price of $2.31 per token \u2013 has become a barrier for anyone living paycheck to paycheck. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Rich List Data Reveals Concentration Based on reports, there are about 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses in existence. Less than 4% of those wallets contain at least 10,000 XRP. A clear majority, over 5 million addresses, hold 500 XRP or fewer. That gap shows how stacked the system is. More than 166,250 wallets sit in the 10,000\u201325,000 XRP range. Another 159,566 wallets carry between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP. These figures point to a small group with deep pockets, while the rest trail far behind. Owning more than 10,000 $XRP nowadays is already a luxury few people can afford. \u2014 EDO FARINA \ud83c\udd67 XRP (@edward_farina) June 9, 2025 Inflation Pressures Hit Small Holders Farina warns that rising inflation is forcing ordinary holders to sell just to cover daily needs. He notes, \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries.\u201d When basic goods cost more each month, people feel they have no choice but to cash out their crypto. It\u2019s a harsh reality. Owning large amounts of XRP has morphed from a luxury into a struggle for survival. Threshold Debate Heats Up He first said 95% of XRP holders risk being priced out. Now he\u2019s raised that warning to 99%. That jump has sparked debate. Some worry it feeds a fear of missing out on a \u201c10,000-XRP club,\u201d while others see it as a wake-up call. Farina questions whether Bitcoin\u2019s rally to about $112,000 really reflects growth, or simply the dollar losing its value. He frames the issue as a tug-of-war between crypto gains and fiat losses. Related Reading: Elon Musk \u2018Will Do Anything\u2019 To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Calls For New Income Streams Instead of selling crypto, Farina urges holders to find extra income. He suggests side hustles or online work as ways to avoid cutting into holdings. \u201cIf you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,\u201d he said. His advice pushes people to rethink how they earn and where they live. Crypto markets can move on legal news and product launches, not only inflation. Ripple\u2019s ongoing court case and ETF filings could change XRP\u2019s path. Still, Farina\u2019s message taps into a broader concern: the gap between small and large holders may widen as prices climb. Retail investors can still join in. They just need to pace their buys and stay aware of both crypto trends and everyday costs. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"
