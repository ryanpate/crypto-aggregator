      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-with-4-of-swifts-volume/",
      "summary": "A recent analysis by a crypto market expert has reignited interest in XRP\u2019s potential utility, especially in the context of Ripple capturing a portion of SWIFT\u2019s global transaction volume. According to the expert, if Ripple secures just 14% of SWIFT\u2019s market share, the implications for XRP\u2019s supply and potential could be significant. XRP\u2019s Potential If Ripple Takes On 14% Of SWIFT Market expert Crypto Eri has emphasized, through detailed mathematical calculations, the impact Ripple, capturing 14% of SWIFT\u2019s total annual cross-border volume, could have on XRP\u2019s supply and daily transactions. Notably, the market expert emphasized that if Ripple were to process such a percentage, which is roughly $4.2 trillion, it would require a surprisingly small portion of XRP\u2019s total supply to support the transaction. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance According to Crypto Eri\u2019s calculations, the $4.2 trillion annual volume translates to approximately $11.5 billion in daily transaction value. To assess how much the altcoin would be needed to facilitate this, the analyst assumed a deliberately conservative scenario, with each token being used once every three minutes. This is significantly slower than XRP\u2019s actual settlement capability of 3 to 5 seconds but was chosen to reflect the potential liquidity management constraints in real-world applications. With 86,400 seconds in a day and each transaction occupying about 80 seconds, each XRP could be used for up to 480 transactions daily. Moreover, at the current market price of $2.15, Crypto Eri calculated that one XRP could facilitate $1,032 worth of transactions per day. To process the estimated $11.5 billion in daily volume, this would need approximately 11.15 million XRP tokens. This figure is striking when compared to XRP\u2019s circulating supply, which currently stands at around 58.82 billion tokens. Crypto Eri stated that just 0.0190% of this supply would be necessary to handle the calculated transaction volume, reinforcing the idea that XRP\u2019s high velocity and reusability make it a possible efficient bridge asset. Overall, Crypto Eri\u2019s Ripple-SWIFT analysis model presents a compelling case for XRP\u2019s utility in the global payments space. Her calculations and projections have also sparked widespread engagement across the crypto community, with several independent researchers and members concurring with her assessment and contributing their data-driven models to validate the projections further. The Token Burn Rate Estimates For Trillion-Dollar Use Case As XRP\u2019s potential utility in global finance is brought into focus by Crypto Eri, the market expert also offers new insight into XRP\u2019s burn rate in terms of fees needed to facilitate a $5 trillion annual transaction volume. A crypto community member followed up on the analyst\u2019s earlier Ripple and SWIFT calculations by asking how many of the token would be conservatively burned through transaction fees. Related Reading: Liquidity Levels Show XRP Price Is Headed Up, But Must Cross $2.40 First The analyst estimated that only 5,000 XRP would be permanently burned in the process\u2014an astonishingly small figure considering the massive scale of value being transferred. The estimate assumes an average transaction size of $10,000, which would result in roughly 500 million transactions per year to reach the $5 trillion mark.

      "summary": "Ethereum has remained in a volatile consolidation phase, trading between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels as geopolitical tensions weigh heavily on global markets. After last week\u2019s failed breakout above resistance, ETH has retraced yet again, struggling to build sustained momentum. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified market uncertainty, contributing to spikes in volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation \u2013 Details Despite the macro headwinds, Ethereum bulls continue to defend key support levels, preventing a deeper breakdown. The $2,400 zone has acted as a strong floor in recent weeks, absorbing sell pressure and keeping ETH within its current trading range. Meanwhile, the $2,800 resistance remains the major hurdle to reclaim for a bullish breakout scenario. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum is still consolidating below a key resistance area. This structure indicates that ETH is coiling before its next major move. The window for a potential breakout narrows as price tightens within this established range. Ethereum Prepares To Move Ethereum has pushed into a critical price zone, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,600\u2013$2,700 range after recent volatility. The asset has shown resilience, rebounding from last week\u2019s lows and re-entering the mid-range of its multi-week consolidation. With price action once again approaching the $2,800 resistance level, market participants are eyeing a potential breakout that could open the door to $3,000 and beyond. Analysts remain divided. On one side, bullish momentum and improving market sentiment suggest ETH is preparing for a larger move. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger aggressive buying and initiate a broader altcoin rally. Many investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of a rotation from Bitcoin into high-beta assets like Ethereum, hoping to ride the next phase of the cycle. On the other side, caution persists. Some technical analysts argue that Ethereum may still be at risk of losing steam, especially if the price gets rejected again at resistance. A failure to maintain the current range could result in a retracement toward $2,400 support or even lower, shaking out weak hands. According to a recent technical update from Jelle, Ethereum remains locked in consolidation just below its key resistance zone. The analysis points to a tightening structure where the window of opportunity is closing. If ETH breaks above this zone, it could ignite fireworks across the altcoin market. With global uncertainty still present and traders closely watching resistance levels, Ethereum\u2019s next move could define the pace of the broader market. Whether it\u2019s a breakout or a breakdown, the coming days are likely to be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support \u2013 Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Action: Technical Details Ethereum is currently trading at $2,606, maintaining a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 as shown in the 12-hour chart. After multiple rejections around the $2,800 zone, the asset is struggling to break through this resistance level decisively. Despite the volatility triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty and Middle East conflict, ETH has managed to defend the $2,500 area, supported by a rising 100-period moving average. The recent bounce from the lower end of the range suggests that bulls are still active, stepping in to defend critical structure. However, volume remains relatively muted, indicating that buyers are cautious and awaiting confirmation before initiating larger positions. Meanwhile, the 50-period moving average remains above the 200-period MA, hinting at a medium-term bullish bias if support continues to hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds $2,500 Support \u2013 History Signals $4,000 As Potential Target The yellow horizontal zone marks the key resistance Ethereum must clear to trigger a sustained move higher, with a clean break above $2,800 likely igniting upside momentum toward $3,000.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-is-still-bullish/",
      "summary": "Crypto analyst X Force has drawn the crypto community\u2019s attention to a key fractal from 2023, which paints a bullish picture for the Bitcoin price. However, the analyst suggested that a drop to $90,000 could still be on the cards for BTC, although that won\u2019t invalidate the macro setup. Key Fractal Shows Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish In an X post, X Force highlighted a key fractal from the early phase of the 2023 bull market and noted why it supports the view that the current trend remains bullish. He remarked that the price structure that was observed back then could offer insights relevant to the current analysis, as history often rhymes even though it might not repeat itself exactly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000 Imminent As Fibonacci Resistance Is At Stake X Force then noted that in 2023, a larger degree wave 1 terminated, followed by a shallow wave 2 that retraced only to the 23.6% to 38.2% Fibonacci levels. The analyst then declared that this interpretation wasn\u2019t just hindsight but it was the only valid count even in real-time. He also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price creating another low. X Force explained that the context of the micro timeframes is losing weight as every bounce and dump is extremely sensitive to the overall creation of the wave structure. Meanwhile, the analyst indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop to as low as $90,000 but noted that it is important that BTC remains above this critical support level. In an X post, the crypto analyst stated that as long as the Bitcoin price stays above the $90,000 level, the implications of the shorter-term price action have zero impact on the overall macro trend. X Force added that pullbacks and choppiness are not only healthy but vital to any bull market. A BTC Price Crash Imminent? Veteran trader Peter Brandt has raised the possibility of a Bitcoin price crash happening soon. In an X post, he questioned if November 2021 was happening all over again for the flagship crypto. His accompanying chart showed how that period formed the cycle peak for BTC, following a double top formation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $107,000 Is Ideal, But Don\u2019t Get Excited Until This Happens The Bitcoin price then crashed from its all-time high (ATH) of around $69,000 and consolidated for over two years before witnessing another breakout in 2024. The chart indicated that BTC may have formed a double top again following the recent rally to a new all-time high of $111,900. If so, this could mark the end of the cycle\u2019s bull run, with a crash set to follow. However, the chart suggested that BTC could sustain this bull run if it holds above $104,612. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $106,700, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

      "summary": "Ethereum is holding strong despite a week filled with extreme volatility and heightened geopolitical tensions. Following escalations in the Middle East, with conflict between Israel and Iran fueling global market uncertainty, ETH managed to maintain its critical price range. After briefly dipping earlier in the week, Ethereum has reclaimed momentum and is now trading around crucial levels that could define the next move for the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation \u2013 Details Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook suggesting that the bullish scenario remains intact for Ethereum. According to his analysis, ETH is successfully holding its range structure, a key signal that buyers are still in control. This stability at current levels offers confidence to investors watching for a breakout that could lead to a broader altcoin rally. With the macro backdrop still fragile due to rising US Treasury yields and global conflict, Ethereum\u2019s ability to sustain its structure is a sign of relative strength. While the path ahead remains uncertain, all eyes are now on Ethereum\u2019s ability to hold these levels and break through resistance zones. If it does, it could be the trigger needed for renewed momentum in the altcoin market. Ethereum Holds the Line as Bulls Target Breakout Ethereum has gained over 7% since last Friday, recovering from recent lows triggered by macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical instability. The bounce reignited optimism across the market, but price action continues to face a tough challenge at key resistance levels. ETH briefly broke above the $2,800 mark last week, a level that many analysts viewed as a gateway to a broader rally. However, the move lacked follow-through, and Ethereum quickly slipped back below that level, suggesting a lack of conviction or the presence of heavy overhead supply. This divergence in momentum has split analyst opinion. Some argue that Ethereum\u2019s breakout could still ignite a new altcoin season, with ETH leading the charge. Others caution that the repeated failure to sustain higher levels might indicate weakness, and warn that a breakdown below the current range could send Ethereum toward the $2,500 zone or lower. Still, Ted Pillows believes the overall structure remains bullish. His latest analysis emphasizes that the scenario is unchanged: as long as ETH holds the range low as support, the market remains intact and poised to move higher. This support zone has repeatedly acted as a floor for ETH since early May. Ultimately, the next move will be decisive. Ethereum\u2019s ability to hold the range and reclaim $2,800 could pave the way toward $3,000 and beyond. But failure to defend support may increase selling pressure and shift market sentiment. For now, the battle between bulls and bears continues, with Ethereum\u2019s structure offering hope to those betting on an upside breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support \u2013 Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade within a defined range after another failed attempt to break above the $2,800 resistance. According to the chart, ETH is currently priced at $2,626.98, down 0.09% on the 4-hour timeframe. Price action shows strong wicks near the resistance zone, suggesting rejection at the upper boundary around $2,770\u2013$2,800, while buyers stepped in as soon as ETH approached the confluence of the 50, 100, and 200 moving averages between $2,576 and $2,619. This range, which has been developing since early May, remains intact. The chart highlights that ETH has respected the $2,580\u2013$2,620 zone as support, confirming this as the lower bound of the range. As long as ETH holds above this level, bulls are likely to remain in control. However, a failure to reclaim the resistance zone with conviction could lead to another pullback. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week \u2013 Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? Volume has slightly picked up near support, signaling buyer interest, but the lack of follow-through near the highs keeps ETH stuck within its range.
