      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-to-92000/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action is holding firm above the $108,000 level despite a string of minor pullbacks in recent trading sessions. Notably, CoinGecko data shows that the Bitcoin price has climbed to an intraday high of $109,116, but it wasn&#8217;t able to hold above and has retreated slightly lower at the time of writing. Volatility has been relatively subdued for Bitcoin above $106,000. However, Doctor Profit, a well-followed crypto analyst, believes Bitcoin is still in a bullish structure, and he outlined two likely paths for the next major move. Bull Flag And Breakout To $130,000 With Retest The first scenario outlined by Doctor Profit involves a breakout to a price level between $113,000 and $114,000, which would take Bitcoin to a new all-time high in the process. However, this all-time high would be very brief. According to this scenario, a sharp correction is expected to follow once Bitcoin reaches this range. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This correction will send the price back down into the $92,000 to $93,000 range to fill a CME gap and tap into a major liquidity pool. Rather than causing panic, the analyst views this move as part of a bullish continuation. This potential retracement zone is clearly marked on Doctor Profit&#8217;s daily candlestick chart with the message \u201cAdd more if market allows.\u201d The pullback, if it happens, would serve to reset the market and initiate a bounce before Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory to $120,000 again. Direct Rally To $120,000 Without Retest The second path skips the correction altogether. In this scenario, Bitcoin breaks through the flag resistance to rally past $113,000. From there, the scenario sees Bitcoin continuing upward without returning to the lower support zones. The move hinges on the ability of Bitcoin to gain momentum rapidly and lead to a strong push toward $120,000. Doctor Profit points out that this option is a more aggressive bullish continuation, and both scenarios are valid for bullish price targets in the long term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline He also debunked fears surrounding the sudden movement of a dormant Satoshi-era whale wallet containing 80,000 BTC. The analyst believes the transfer was likely an over-the-counter deal between a large private entity and an institution or government and not a sign of looming sell pressure. Volatility is going to be very low in the coming days, as there are no macro market events that can cause price volatility. FOMC meeting minutes are due Wednesday, and there are going to be US unemployment claims on Thursday, but both are low-volatility events. Nonetheless, the $113,000 to $114,000 price range is the most important level to watch in both scenarios. What follows from there, a sharp correction or a straight continuation, will define the speed of the next leg to $120,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,270.

Their target sits at $0.000015 if PEPE holds above the key support line at $0.0000102. That level has been tested multiple times in recent weeks, demonstrating some buying interest each time prices approached it. Traders warn that slipping below $0.0000102 could derail hopes for the next big leg up. Triangle Formation Signals Tension A recent chart indicates that PEPE is trading within a triangle pattern. Traders track triangles closely because they can lead to rapid moves following a breakout. Currently, PEPE is wedged at the top of this triangle. When trading volume picks up and the token closes over the old resistance line (indicated in red), it could ignite a new wave of buyers. Community Buzz Keeps Meme Coins Alive Meme tokens survive by social fervor, and PEPE has developed a devoted fan base on sites like X. Meme posts and community-led memes have powered previous rallies, prompting new investors to jump aboard. According to reports, continued buzz might be sufficient to initiate another run at least in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details Risks And Rewards In Focus Even if history does rhyme, it doesn&#8217;t often repeat itself. Previous runs had PEPE tank just as severely, losing as much as 95% of profits in one session. Gambling on a 20X spike involves taking wild swings and sudden plunges.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/why-xrp-stands-to-gain-big-from-ripple-rlusd/",
      "summary": "Ripple\u2019s dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has spent the past six months quietly becoming one of the fastest-growing assets in the $160 billion stable-value sector, even though almost all of its issuance still sits on a rival network, not the XRP Ledger. That dichotomy\u201495 percent of the $455 million supply now lives on Ethereum\u2014was the starting point for a lively weekend exchange on X between XRP pundit \u201cCrypto Eri\u201d and sceptics who questioned whether Ripple\u2019s plans would ever benefit the XRP Ledger (XRPL) itself. XRP\u2019s Hidden Advantage? \u201cRipple is a long-game player,\u201d Eri wrote. \u201cIts public statements to integrate smart contracts on the mainnet will eventually position RLUSD on XRPL as a more competitive stablecoin, with faster and cheaper settlements than Ethereum.\u201d The remark landed just days after Ripple switched on its EVM-compatible sidechain, bringing full Ethereum-style smart-contract functionality to XRPL on 30 June 2025. More than 1,400 contracts were deployed in the first week, according to developer telemetry, and the bridge is already live to 80 other chains through Axelar. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts On-chain data underscore the stakes. RLUSD\u2019s circulating supply rose by 47 percent in June alone to $455 million, the fastest pace among major stablecoins, with roughly $390 million now native to Ethereum after a four-fold expansion since January. Only about $65 million remains on XRPL. That imbalance prompted one user to tell Eri that RLUSD\u2019s utility \u201cimpacts ETH more than XRP.\u201d She conceded the point\u2014\u201ccorrect, for now\u201d\u2014but argued demand would migrate once XRPL\u2019s programmability and liquidity deepen. Ripple\u2019s strategy hinges on more than code. On 2 June the company applied to the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a national trust-bank charter. A parallel filing by its subsidiary, Standard Custody &#38; Trust, seeks a Federal Reserve master account so that RLUSD reserves can eventually sit at the central bank rather than a correspondent institution. The timing aligns with the pending GENIUS Act, bipartisan legislation that for the first time would impose a single federal regime on payment-stablecoin issuers. While the bill\u2019s $10 billion-asset threshold means RLUSD could remain under New York oversight for now, the application positions Ripple to graduate into federal supervision voluntarily\u2014a move CEO Brad Garlinghouse has called a \u201cnew (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.\u201d Eri underscored the charter angle in her post: \u201cThe national banking license application, aligned with the GENIUS Act, secures a Federal Reserve master account \u2026 enhancing trust, expanding crypto financial and payment services, and removing the patchwork of state licenses, enabling continued scalability at lower cost.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Breakdown To Next Support Level, Why $2.28 Is Important If the charter is granted and RLUSD begins to migrate on-demand to XRPL, two flywheels favor the native token, analysts say. First, RLUSD remittances on XRPL would pay transaction fees in XRP, turning every dollar of stablecoin volume into incremental demand for the asset Ripple still holds in large quantities. Second, the EVM sidechain lets decentralized-finance builders tap RLUSD liquidity without leaving XRP\u2019s low-cost consensus layer, potentially reversing the flow of users and liquidity that has so far moved toward Ethereum. \u201cThese calculated steps in the $$$$$-dollar stablecoin market give the digital asset XRP enormous potential, but require more time to unfold,\u201d Eri argues. For now, RLUSD\u2019s growth is still driven by Ethereum\u2019s DeFi economy, and sceptics like user \u201csammie\u201d insist \u201cit\u2019s always going to be like this.\u201d Eri\u2019s final reply was succinct: \u201cLet\u2019s see. I know we\u2019ll be touching base often!\u201d That brevity captures both the promise and the uncertainty ahead. Technical rails are in place; regulatory applications are filed. Whether capital, compliance, and market demand will converge quickly enough to shift billions of RLUSD onto XRPL\u2014and in turn lift XRP\u2019s utility\u2014remains the multi-billion-dollar question. At press time, XRP traded at $2.27. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/snaky-way-presale-live-ai-meme-coin-ake-gears-up-for-bull-run/",
      "summary": "If you\u2019ve been around crypto long enough, you know the signs. Bitcoin wakes up. Ethereum starts stretching. Suddenly, the air feels different. Whispers of the next bull run are back. And as always, the early birds are hunting for that next moonshot. While most eyes are glued to the usual suspects, a slithery new player is wriggling into the spotlight \u2013 and no, it\u2019s not another dog coin. Snaky Way ($AKE), a meme coin with actual utility, is now in the presale phase and turning heads. Packed with AI-powered buybacks, multichain access, and a play-to-earn game, Snaky Way is shaping up to be a meme coin with real staying power. The crypto presale is now live, and early buyers are already scooping up $AKE at just $0.0000942. Let&#8217;s dive in \u2013 but watch your step, there might be a snake lurking nearby. What Is Snaky Way ($AKE) and Why Is It Different? Snaky Way ($AKE) is part meme coin, part AI bot, and part arcade. That\u2019s already three more things than most of the best meme coins offer. The token at the center of it all is $AKE \u2013 yes, like \u2018snake\u2019 without the \u2018sn.\u2019 It\u2019s crawling onto seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum, so you can dodge gas fees like a ninja. But here\u2019s the real twist: they\u2019ve embedded an AI agent into the smart contract that automatically buys back tokens when the price starts to dip. Think of it like a tiny, caffeinated trader living in your token. It watches the price 24/7. When panic sellers show up, it steps in and buys the dip \u2013 automatically. That helps smooth out those gut-wrenching price dumps that meme coins are famous for. Oh, and there&#8217;s a snake-themed game coming too. Win matches, earn $AKE, and spend tokens on in-game gear and tournaments. So instead of just hoping the token moons, you\u2019re actually doing something with it. Imagine if Flappy Bird paid your rent \u2013 it\u2019s a bit like that, just less flapping and more slithering. Why Buy $AKE Right Now? Right now, you can snag $AKE for just $0.0000942. That\u2019s couch-cushion money. But we&#8217;ve all seen what happens when a meme coin catches fire. Just ask early $DOGE or $SHIB holders, who are looking at returns of over 30,000% and 800,000%, respectively, since listing. The presale is already gaining momentum with $164K raised and climbing. This isn\u2019t just a hobby project with vibes and a dream. The team\u2019s got a roadmap, audits, and tokenomics that actually make sense. Only 3% of tokens go to the team, and they\u2019re vesting. That\u2019s a far cry from the usual 20%+ cash grabs you see all over new crypto launches. They\u2019re setting aside 30% of the supply for early buyers and using 29% for marketing, which, let\u2019s be real, is the lifeblood of meme coins. Even the best altcoins need eyeballs to grow. The rest goes to liquidity, staking rewards, and community goodies. Speaking of staking, early $AKE holders are seeing annual returns north of 10,000% right now. That number will shrink as more people join, but hey, it\u2019s not every day that your meme coin offers rewards that look like lottery numbers. With strong tokenomics, multichain support, and a game that gives the coin purpose beyond \u2018number go up,\u2019 Snaky Way is sliding into some serious potential. Don\u2019t Sleep on the Snake The Snaky Way ($AKE) presale is live, and the stars are lining up. You\u2019ve got meme appeal, gaming utility, and a smart AI system keeping price dips in check. It\u2019s weirdly serious for a meme coin, and that\u2019s exactly why it might surprise everyone when the market starts heating up again. Meme coins usually come down to hype and timing. Snaky Way brings something new to the table: a reason to stay. And if history repeats itself, the next bull run might just crown a new reptilian king. As always, remember this is not financial advice, and do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto."

      "summary": "Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun has lost a significant chunk of its market share to LetsBonk.fun. This comes just ahead of the former\u2019s token generation event, in which the launchpad could raise up to $4 billion. Solana\u2019s Pump.fun Loses Dominance To LetsBonk.fun In an X post, Solana News revealed that Pump.fun has hit a new all-time low with just a 36% market share, while LetsBonk.fun\u2019s market share has surged to 54%. Jup data also confirms this development. At press time, LetsBonk boasts a market share of 48.90%, with a 24-hour trading volume of $539 million. On the other hand, Pump boasts a market share of 39.80%, with a 24-hour trading volume of $438 million. Related Reading: Analyst Says Buying This Meme Coin Is A 3X Leveraged Play If Solana ETFs Go Live This development comes amid Pump.fun\u2019s proposed public token sale, scheduled for July 12. Well-known Solana influencer Lynk has described this token sale as the \u201cfinal scam\u201d for the meme coin launchpad. The platform has been under heavy criticism for the amount of money that it has extracted from the Solana ecosystem, without incentivizing community members in any way. Some community members had expected Pump.fun to airdrop its token to rewards platform users instead of conducting a public token sale. Lynk shared details of the public sale, with the meme coin launchpad planning to sell the \u2018PUMP\u2019 tokens $0.004 each. The token boasts a total supply of 1 trillion, meaning a fully diluted value (FDV) of $4 billion. However, Pump.fun plans to raise around $600 million from the public token sale, as only $150 billion tokens will be available. The meme coin launchpad is expected to also conduct a private sale in order to complete its $1 billion capital raise effort, as earlier reported. LetsBonk.fun To Keep Dominating Pump.fun In an X post, crypto influencer Unipcs, also known as \u2018Bonk Guy,\u2019 opined that Pump.fun isn\u2019t done, but that LetsBonk.fun will likely continue to be the industry leader. He predicts that this will be the case for the foreseeable future. He outlined several reasons why he believes this would be the case. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs Firstly, he stated that LetsBonk\u2019s pro-creator, pro-people, pro-Solana ecosystem alignment is a massive strength over Pump.fun.

Furthermore, the crypto influencer remarked that Pump.fun had a lot of momentum as a tokenless protocol, especially with a token generation event (TGE). However, LetsBonk.fun was able to flip the platform during this period. As such, Bonk Guy believes that it is hard to see Pump.fun sustainably recover the kind of market share it once had after the TGE event. He also suggested that a \u201cnon-negligible amount of activity on Pump.fun is inorganic with a lot os users farming on the platform, hoping that there was going to be an airdrop. As such, the influencer believes that the traffic will dry up once the TGE is over. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"
