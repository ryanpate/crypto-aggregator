      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-remain-steady-as-cdd-normalizes-after-false-alarm/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is testing uncharted territory after breaking past its previous all-time high of $112,000 last Thursday, igniting a powerful new phase in the bull market. With the price currently hovering above $117,000, bulls are firmly in control as optimism spreads across the crypto market. The breakout comes after weeks of tight consolidation, signaling renewed confidence among investors and traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb \u2013 Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds further support to the bullish narrative. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric\u2014used to assess whether long-term holders are selling\u2014has returned to a relatively low average despite the rise in price. This suggests that experienced holders are not offloading their positions, but instead continuing to hold through the rally. With long-term holders largely inactive and momentum accelerating, Bitcoin appears to be entering a decisive phase. As macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for risk assets, and with institutional demand rising, all eyes are now on how BTC behaves at these new highs\u2014and whether the rest of the crypto market will follow its lead. Bitcoin Prepares For A Massive Surge Bitcoin continues to trade above key psychological and technical levels, signaling that the market is entering an expansion phase with the potential for a massive surge. After clearing its previous all-time high and consolidating around $117,000, Bitcoin&#8217;s structure looks increasingly bullish. Analysts and traders are closely watching on-chain indicators to confirm whether long-term holders are beginning to exit, but so far, the data suggests they are not. Top analyst Darkfost shared relevant insights regarding the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, a key tool used to assess long-term holder activity. CDD calculates how long a Bitcoin stays unmoved before a transfer, revealing long-term participants&#8217; behavior. Recently, the metric saw a sharp spike, raising initial concerns about possible distribution. However, it was later confirmed that the move involved 80,000 BTC in an internal transfer \u2014 no actual selling occurred. Since that event, the CDD has returned to its previous low range, especially when compared to Bitcoin\u2019s soaring price. This signals that long-term holders are still sitting tight, showing no urgency to sell into strength. Their conviction reflects growing expectations of higher prices ahead, supported by macro conditions, increasing adoption, and rising institutional interest. With strong hands holding firm and momentum building, Bitcoin appears poised for continuation. As long as key support levels are maintained and long-term holders remain inactive, the setup favors an explosive move that could redefine price discovery in this cycle.

Thursday\u2019s candle closed firmly above the former record cluster at $109,300, opening the door for a vertical push that carried price to $118,800 on the very next print. The candle body towers well above the 50\u2011period SMA, while the 100\u2011 and 200\u2011period averages slope higher beneath, confirming a bullish long\u2011term structure. The old resistance band between $105,000 and $109,300 now flips into first demand; any orderly retest that wicks into that zone would likely attract sidelined buyers. Below it, $103,600\u2014the mid\u2011range support that capped drawdowns all spring\u2014remains the line in the sand for the current trend.

Momentum oscillators on medium time\u2011frames are stretched but not at extreme levels, suggesting room for continuation before a cooling period becomes necessary.

      "summary": "Pump.fun, the Solana-based platform enabling users to easily launch and trade custom tokens\u2014especially meme coins\u2014has just marked a historic milestone. On Saturday, Pump.fun raised over $500 million during its highly anticipated PUMP token public sale. In an astonishing show of demand, the sale sold out in only 12 minutes, highlighting the project\u2019s explosive growth and rising popularity across the crypto space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Continues Historic Climb \u2013 Altcoins Struggle To Gain Ground Designed for accessibility, Pump.fun allows virtually anyone to create tradable tokens with little to no technical background, democratizing the meme coin economy. As the broader crypto market gains momentum, investors are increasingly turning to innovative platforms like Pump.fun to capture early-stage upside and participate in speculative narratives. With the public sale now closed, the PUMP token is entering its distribution phase. The community\u2019s overwhelming enthusiasm for the project underscores a renewed appetite for high-risk, high-reward opportunities, especially on scalable, low-cost ecosystems like Solana. As liquidity rotates and meme narratives strengthen, Pump.fun appears poised to ride the next wave of speculative fervor. The question now is how the project will evolve post-sale, and whether it can sustain attention in an increasingly competitive memecoin landscape. Pump.fun Enters Distribution Phase After $4 Billion Valuation Following a record-breaking public sale, Pump.fun is now entering its next crucial phase. The Solana-based platform successfully sold 125 billion PUMP tokens at a fixed price of $0.004 each, pushing the project to a staggering $4 billion valuation. In just 12 minutes, the token sale closed, signaling overwhelming interest from both retail investors and speculators eager to participate in the next wave of memecoin mania. Over the next 48 to 72 hours, the PUMP tokens purchased via token.pump.fun will be distributed to all participants. During this period, the tokens will remain untradable and untransferable to ensure a secure and orderly allocation process. The team has stated that a formal announcement will be made once the distribution is complete and trading becomes active. Pump.fun has gained traction for allowing users to mint and list custom tokens with just a few clicks. Once a newly created token reaches a certain liquidity or trading threshold, it gets automatically listed on decentralized exchanges. This enables price discovery and broader exposure. This simplicity has fueled Pump.fun\u2019s meteoric rise, attracting thousands of users who see it as a launchpad for the next viral asset. However, the coming weeks will be a critical test. As the PUMP token becomes tradable, investor behavior, price volatility, and platform growth will determine whether this momentum turns into lasting adoption or fades as just another memecoin moment. With a multi-billion-dollar valuation already on the books, the pressure is on for Pump.fun to deliver. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Pushes Ethereum As \u2018World Reserve Asset\u2019 \u2013 Details Altcoin Market Gathers Momentum The TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, has surged to $918.87 billion, gaining nearly 9% on the week. This move signals growing investor confidence in altcoins, supported by a bullish market structure. Price bounced from the 50-week moving average and now aims to break above the $1 trillion resistance zone. A level that has rejected multiple rallies in 2025. Momentum indicators are turning bullish, with the 50, 100, and 200 weekly moving averages aligning in an upward slope. Volume is also increasing after weeks of stagnation, reflecting renewed market participation and capital rotation into high-beta altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 \u2013 Price Magnet Forming Interestingly, the rise of projects like Pump.fun\u2014which recently raised millions during its PUMP token sale\u2014mirrors this trend.

While TOTAL3 remains below its 2024 highs, the ongoing wave of investor enthusiasm, especially in niche segments like Pump.fun, suggests a breakout could soon materialize.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-explodes-in-past-week-next-top/",
      "summary": "The Cardano price has witnessed an exhilarating run over the past few days, experiencing a significant breakout from consolidation beneath the $0.6 level. Before its recent price surge, the altcoin had been moving mostly sideways within the $0.5 and $0.6 range. Interestingly, the Cardano price seems to just be at the beginning of what is expected to be a monstrous rally over the next few months. A crypto expert on the social media platform X has come forward with an exciting pathway to unprecedented price highs for the ADA token. ADA In Distribution Phase \u2014 Perfect Buying Opportunity? In a July 11 post on X, Alphractal founder &#38; CEO Joao Wedson shared an exciting bullish picture for the Cardano price over the coming months. The on-chain expert put forward the $4.9 mark as the market top for the ADA token in the next leg up. Related Reading: XRP Price Builds Momentum \u2014 $2.50 Break Sparks Fresh Bullish Wave This bold projection is based on a persistent ascending channel pattern on the daily Cardano price chart. An ascending channel is a chart pattern in technical analysis characterized by two major (rising) trendlines: the upper line acting as the resistance level and the lower line acting as the support level. Typically, the gap between these trendlines is considered a channel within which prices move over a period\u2014while indicating a sustained long-term bullish trend. Traders often use this pattern to identify optimal entry and exit points, as the price usually bounces off the upper resistance level and lower support trendline. As observed in the above chart, the Cardano price has been trading within the ascending channel since the first half of 2019. After falling to the lower trendline earlier this year, the price of ADA soon found support and rebounded to above the $1 level in 2025\u2019s first quarter. However, the altcoin \u2014 as with the rest of the crypto market \u2014 witnessed a severe downturn that saw the Cardano price return to the lower trendline in late June. Interestingly, the token\u2019s price seems to have found support and is recovering nicely. Wedson, in his post on X, revealed that what the Cardano price is experiencing is more than a mere recovery, as the altcoin might surpass its current all-time high of $3.09 in this phase. According to the on-chain analyst, the ADA token could be trading well above the $3 mark by late October or early November 2025. Furthermore, Wedson noted that the current level might be the right time for investors to jump into the ADA token, as it is still in the distribution phase in the short term. \u201cThis might break some technical analysis patterns, but the on-chain analysis looks promising in several aspects \u2014 and that\u2019s what I like,\u201d the analyst concluded. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ADA stands at around $0.7124, reflecting an almost 6% in the past 24 hours. This positive single-day action underscores the general bullishness that the altcoin has witnessed in the past few days. According to data from CoinGecko, the ADA coin is up by roughly 30% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Rockets to $0.20 \u2014 Can It Go Even Higher?

      "summary": "After a near-excellent start to the month of July, Bitcoin has performed even more impressively over the past few days. The premier cryptocurrency, after a brief period of sideways momentum earlier this week, has attained a new all-time-high valuation at a price close to $119,000. Unsurprisingly, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a wave of optimism \u2014 an inference still heavily backed by the latest on-chain revelation. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Shifts Bullish In a July 11 post on social media platform X, cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal delved into the current price action of Bitcoin, offering insights into the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800\u2014Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? The firm&#8217;s on-chain observation revolves around the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (7 Days) metric, which visualizes price zones with high concentrations of long or short liquidations over a span of 7 days, and the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (1 month) which does the same, except that this covers a monthly timeframe. After the most recent Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high, all of the overleveraged bears had their market positions wiped out. Aided by the short squeeze, which usually follows such large liquidation events, the flagship cryptocurrency still retains its strong bullish momentum and continues to surge. According to Alphractal, the aggregation liquidation levels across different timeframes now show that most current leveraged positions are betting on the Bitcoin price. As the market continues to ascend the charts, investor optimism will turn more positive, which may further push more traders to open long positions in the BTC futures market. However, Alphractal warned against the inclination to be recklessly involved in the current bullish market. \u201cIf, for any reason, the price drops $10,000 back to the $107,000 zone, it could be the bulls\u2019 turn to face massive liquidations,\u201d the analytics firm said. The firm went further, explaining that a Bitcoin price drop of that magnitude would have a negative impact on the market optimism. On the bright side, Alphractal also mentioned that such an occurrence could offer new accumulation opportunities in the near future. Still on market optimism, a drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s value by $10,000 might lead to a phenomenon referred to as a Long squeeze, where the price of Bitcoin continues to plummet with increased momentum. A long squeeze typically occurs when the falling price of a cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) forces traders with long positions to sell their assets either to cut losses or to break even. This contributes to the already present bearish momentum and sends the BTC price further south. Amidst Bitcoin&#8217;s current rally, Alphractal ultimately advised that traders leverage wisely and with caution, as the market&#8217;s next action stands at an unpredictable zone. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Still showing signs of healthy bullish momentum, Bitcoin, as of press time, is valued at around $118,145. Data from CoinGecko shows that the flagship cryptocurrency has jumped by more than 3.34% in the last 24 hours.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has rallied massively over the past seven days by posting an impressive price gain of nearly 9% after climbing from around $108,300 to almost $118,800. This move was quite surprising, particularly as the process saw Bitcoin clearing its previous all-time high from late May by breaking above $111,970. But according to Bitcoin technical analyst CryptoCon, this breakout may just be the beginning. In a recent post on the social media platform X, CryptoCon revealed a long-term cycle pattern that points to a more ambitious price target for Bitcoin. Analyst Unveils BTC&#8217;s Golden Number For This Cycle In a recent post on social media platform X, CryptoCon revealed a long-term cycle pattern that points to a more ambitious target for Bitcoin. His analysis is based on the 5.618 Fibonacci extension, which is a number he says has perfectly aligned with every prior cycle top. The projection opens up the possibility of whether Bitcoin\u2019s current move marks the start of another parabolic run. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It\u2019s Now \u2018Illegal\u2019 To Short Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why CryptoCon\u2019s technical chart analysis builds on the recurring 5.618 Fibonacci extension level in previous market cycles. The analyst shows how Bitcoin\u2019s previous tops have fallen within striking distance of this precise extension by measuring the move of each market cycle and applying this golden ratio. The chart shown below features the $30.84 peak in June 2011, the $1,205 top in November 2013, the $18,702 high from December 2017, and the peak of $63,839 in November 2021. Each of these market tops, as shown in the Bitcoin multi-year price chart below, converged on the same 5.618 multiple from their preceding bear market lows. Now, using this same approach in the ongoing cycle, CryptoCon projected that the next major step for Bitcoin is somewhere between $170,000 and $180,000. Particularly, the 5.618 Fibonacci extension points to a &#8220;Golden Number&#8221; of $184,181 for Bitcoin&#8217;s price in this cycle. Bitcoin Price Compression Is About To Expand Violently Several major forces appear to have contributed to BTC&#8217;s recent surge in the past 48 hours. A significant short squeeze earlier in the week reportedly wiped out over $1 billion in bearish positions. At the same time, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered over $1 billion in daily inflows in the past two consecutive days. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Breakdown \u2014 Here\u2019s The Best Time To Buy In his X post, CryptoCon also commented on the current state of Bitcoin\u2019s chart: \u201cAll the boring price action is coming to a squeeze; it can&#8217;t stay that way forever.\u201d This observation reflects the long period of tight, sideways trading between $105,000 and $108,000 that Bitcoin experienced in the previous two weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,762, retracing slightly after reaching its most recent all-time high of $118,667, according to CoinGecko data. Other crypto analysts now find themselves watching the $130,000 region as another zone of consolidation activity on the way to the possible cycle peak.
