Based on reports from Tronscan, this step targets wallets allegedly linked to money laundering and sanctions evasion.

Related Reading: Amid Bitcoin Hype, Seasoned Trader Predicts Sudden Drop To This Level T3 Financial Crime Unit Shows Muscle According to Tether, its T3 Financial Crime Unit (FCU) partners with Tron and TRM Labs to track suspect transactions in real time. Since late 2024, the FCU has frozen over $126 million in questionable assets. In the last quarter of that year alone, $100 million was blocked.

Individuals on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list are the natural targets. In March 2025, for example, Tether froze $27 million worth of USDT on the Russian-linked exchange Garantex following the EU&#8217;s 16th package of sanctions. Garantex later suspended services and claimed that over 2.5 billion rubles of user funds were held up. Lazarus Group Faces $374K Blacklist Reports show that North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group has moved more than $3 billion in stolen crypto since 2009. In November 2023, Tether blacklisted $374,000 in USDT tied to Lazarus\u2011associated addresses. Other stablecoin companies joined together to lock up $3.4 million in identical wallets. These numbers highlight how large issuers can upset state-sponsored hacking groups. Diversifying With Gold Royalties Tether diversified beyond digital currency on June 12, 2025, by buying a 32% equity stake in Elemental Altus Royalties.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-whales-pull-4500-btc-from-binance-hinting-at-incoming-rally/",
      "summary": "Recent on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) whales may be preparing for a potential rally, as Binance BTC withdrawals have seen a notable spike. Additionally, rising stablecoin inflows to exchanges indicate growing buy-side liquidity, reinforcing the market\u2019s bullish sentiment. Bitcoin Whales Foreseeing Major Rally Ahead? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin whales recorded one of the largest BTC outflows from Binance this month. The chart below shows that nearly 4,500 BTC were withdrawn on June 16. Bitcoin whales are defined as wallet addresses with significant BTC holdings. Past data suggests that such large withdrawals from whales have typically preceded price rallies, as they reflect a reduction in BTC exchange reserves, leaving fewer coins readily available for trading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Beyond this large-scale withdrawal, on-chain data also reveals dwindling BTC inflows to exchanges from both whales and retail investors. This combination of major outflows and low deposits could be laying the groundwork for a Bitcoin \u201csupply crunch.&#8221; For the uninitiated, a Bitcoin supply crunch occurs when the available BTC on exchanges declines sharply, reducing the immediate supply for buyers. This happens when long-term holders or whales withdraw BTC to cold storage, creating upward pressure on price as demand outpaces liquid supply. Stablecoin Inflows Witness Sharp Increase In parallel with Bitcoin\u2019s exchange exodus, stablecoin inflows to Binance have surged in recent days. Notably, over $400 million in stablecoins flowed in on both June 13 and 15. Historically, such significant stablecoin inflows have been linked to buy-side liquidity preparation. In other words, large investors appear ready to deploy capital into crypto assets like BTC, reflecting renewed risk appetite. Taha concluded: The aggressive Bitcoin withdrawals and concurrent stablecoin deposits create a supply-demand asymmetry. With fewer BTC available on exchanges and growing liquidity to fuel buys, the stage is set for a potential price breakout. Meanwhile, additional exchange data supports the case for further upside in BTC. For example, the coin has been experiencing consistently negative funding rates on Binance &#8211; often a precursor to short squeezes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 At the same time, Bitcoin\u2019s long-term holder Realized Cap recently surpassed $20 billion, underscoring rising confidence among seasoned investors. In addition, despite the ongoing BTC rally, retail participation remains relatively low, suggesting further room for growth. However, short-term holders are showing signs of caution, increasing their selling amid recent price corrections. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,575, down 1.0% in the past 24 hours.
