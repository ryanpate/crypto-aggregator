      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-could-hinge-on-this-binance-metric/",
      "summary": "Over the past few weeks, the Ethereum price has struggled to maintain its bullish momentum from early May. The altcoin has been stuck within a consolidation range, jumping between the $2,500 and $2,700 region. While the Ethereum price sat mostly above the $2,600 level throughout the past week, a market-wide downturn saw the altcoin&#8217;s value fall toward $2,400 on Friday, June 6. While the price of ETH has not fully recovered yet, it has at least managed to reclaim the $2,500 level over this weekend. Binance Realized Price Critical For ETH In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Crazzyblockk revealed that the Ethereum price exhibited an interesting reaction around the $2,392 price level on Friday. The crypto pundit noted that this reaction is not random, as it occurred at a significant on-chain level \u2014 the realized price of Binance user deposit addresses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 \u2013 Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash The relevant indicator behind this on-chain observation is the ETH Realized Price metric, which tracks the average cost basis of holders across different cohorts, including the Binance User Deposit Address, OKX User Deposit Address, Addresses Frequently Received From CEX, and Highly Active Addresses. Crazzyblockk highlighted the realized prices across these cohorts, with that of the Binance User Deposit Address standing around $2,392; OKX User Deposit Address at $2,706; Addresses Frequently Received from CEX at $2,532; and Highly Active Addresses with a realized price of $2,513. As seen during the latest dip, the $2,392 realized price represents a major on-chain support level, as it is the cost basis of several Binance user deposit addresses. &#8220;The market&#8217;s bounce from this level highlights the impact of Binance user behavior on ETH\u2019s current price structure,&#8221; Crazzyblockk added. Crazzyblockk also noted that while $2,500 is an average realized price across all the highlighted cohorts, an important detail should not be overlooked \u2014 Binance\u2019s influence on the general market. The crypto pundit explained that Binance holds the highest ETH reserves among all centralized exchanges and has strong dominance in ETH on-chain movement. For this reason, the analyst inferred that the realized price of Binance user deposit addresses ($2,392) is a crucial level to watch in ETH\u2019s market structure. As a result, this level should be considered whenever financial decisions on Ethereum are about to be made. Finally, most investors would be in profit if Ethereum&#8217;s price stays above $2,500, thereby relieving the market of downward pressure, as investors are less likely to sell when in profit. On the flip side, a drop below $2,500 could result in a wave of unrealized losses for the altcoin\u2019s holders, potentially triggering a sell-off and, consequently, an increase in downward pressure. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,523, reflecting a 1.12% jump in the past 24 hours.

It\u2019s the first time this wallet has shown activity in two years. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger The purchase has stirred talk among traders and on-chain analysts alike. Some see it as a sign that big players are getting ready for more action in the weeks ahead. Whale Returns After Two Years According to Lookonchain data, the same whale pulled 500 BTC out of Gemini back in 2022 when Bitcoin was trading near $27,400, a move worth nearly $14 million at the time. Now, with BTC hovering around $105,000, the whale\u2019s holdings sit on an unrealized gain of over $39 million. That kind of profit margin grabs attention. Other large holders often watch these moves closely. They wonder if this is the start of a wider trend or just one wallet\u2019s play. A whale that had been dormant for 2 years bought another 250 $BTC($26.37M) 9 hours ago. 2 years ago, this whale withdrew 500 $BTC($13.7M) from Gemini at $27,401, now sitting on an unrealized profit of $39M.https://t.co/c0U92isSfc pic.twitter.com/vcb4V3M0Uz \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 8, 2025 Big Gains On Early Bet Early adopters have seen massive upside in Bitcoin over the years. This whale\u2019s 2022 withdrawal came just before a multi-year price boom. Since then, Bitcoin has climbed nearly 300%. Not everyone can make moves like that. Small investors often feel left behind when a wallet this size shifts coins. Still, some traders say it can create a ripple of optimism. When big holders buy, retail traders sometimes pile in, chasing the same gains. Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals On the charts, BTC seems to be shaping an inverse cup-and-handle pattern with a significant neckline at $100,800 serving as major support. The price has fallen into the handle stage, and a dip below $100,800 could propel Bitcoin to $91,000, which coincides with its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Bitcoin&#8217;s relative strength index (RSI) is 52, indicating the bullish momentum is fading. A fall below 50 could introduce additional selling pressure. For the bulls to regain control, BTC must recapture the 20-day EMA resistance, which is just above $105,000.

      "summary": "The price of Bitcoin has been in a good recovery form since succumbing to the bearish pressure from the ongoing feud between United States President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The premier cryptocurrency climbed above the $105,000 mark in the early hours of Saturday, June 7. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price looks set to continue its upward trajectory over the next few days. What Negative Leveraged Traders\u2019 Sentiment Means For Price In a new post on the X platform, data analytics firm Alphractal shared fresh on-chain insights into the recent movement of the Bitcoin price. According to the market intelligence firm, the major catalyst of BTC\u2019s latest recovery is the sudden shift in the market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Golden Cross Pattern Says The Crash To $100,000 Is Normal \u2013 What To Expect Next This on-chain observation is based on the Leveraged Traders\u2019 Sentiment, which tracks the outlook or positioning of leveraged traders in the market. It provides insight into the kind of bets (longs or shorts) that leveraged traders are placing in the crypto market and the funding rates of the derivatives market. Data from Alphractal shows a rising interest in opening short positions in the Bitcoin market, with most retail traders betting on a price decline. Ultimately, this on-chain trend suggests that the sentiment in the Bitcoin derivatives market is currently bearish. However, Alphractal noted that this kind of behavior might not be as straightforward as it looks, as the market historically tends to move in the crowd\u2019s opposite direction. Hence, when several traders are betting on a Bitcoin price decline, the flagship cryptocurrency tends to witness a contrasting market bounce. Alphractal said: When sentiment becomes excessively bullish or bearish, the market tends to do the opposite. Therefore, this metric is not just a sentiment gauge \u2014 it&#8217;s also a warning signal for potential contrarian moves that often catch traders off guard. According to the analytics firm, this is exactly what is currently happening in the Bitcoin market, with the market leader bouncing back despite the negative traders\u2019 sentiment. Interestingly, if these leveraged traders continue to bet against Bitcoin, the BTC price could potentially ride this fresh bullish momentum to a new all-time high. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $105,700, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Following the latest resurgence, the premier cryptocurrency is now up by more than 1% on the weekly timeframe.
