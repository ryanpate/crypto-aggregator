      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-closes-daily-price-below-50ma-final-bearish-signal/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to experience an extensive price correction losing over 7% of its market value in the last month. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain its bullish form after setting a new all-time high leading to speculations of a potential market top. Interestingly, popular market analyst and the host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast, Scott Melker has recently shared a market development that supports such bearish notions. Related Reading: Bitcoin CBD Heatmap Marks $95,500\u2013$97,000 As Make-Or-Break Zone \u2013 Details Bitcoin Set For 26% Crash? In an X post on June 21, Scott Melker shares a cautionary insight on the Bitcoin market hinting at a bearish long-term outlook. The season analyst reports that data from TradingView shows that Bitcoin\u2019s has now closed below the 50-day moving average (50 MA) on the daily trading chart, a development that last occurred two months ago when Bitcoin traded around $84,000. The 50MA is a commonly used technical indicator that represents the average closing price of an asset over the past 50 days. As a lagging indicator, it helps traders identify the prevailing market trend. When the price remains above the 50 MA, it typically signals a bullish trend, while a move below the 50 MA may indicate bearish momentum or a potential trend reversal. Interestingly, Melker notes that Bitcoin last lost the 50 MA as a support zone in early February trading around $100,000. However, the loss of this price floor triggered an immense selling pressure forcing Bitcoin into prolonged market correction to reach market low of $74,000 in April. Amidst the current market uncertainty, the recent daily price close below 50 MA strengthens bearish sentiments suggesting Bitcoin is due for another potential 26% crash. In that case, investors could expect a downside target of around $76,200. To invalidate such bearish projections, Bitcoin must continue to hold above the $100,000 resistance level, fueling the chances to retest the current all-time high, and perhaps re-enter price discovery mode.

With a market cap of $2.02 trillion, the \u201cdigital gold\u201d continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency and fifth largest asset in the world. However, according to prominent market analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin may actually be slipping into bearish territory as similarly predicted by Scott Melker. Based on insights from the MVRV pricing bands, if the market lose the current support at $102,000, it opens the door to a potential decline toward $82,000.

      "summary": "On Saturday, Texas became the first-ever US state to commit public funds towards the purchase of Bitcoin. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), officially authorizing the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Keep reading to learn more about this development, increasing investor and government confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term potential, and what&#8217;s the best crypto to buy now in order to ride the upcoming crypto wave. Texas Passes Groundbreaking Bitcoin Reserve Bill &#8216;We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years.&#8217; This is what the Texas Bitcoin bill&#8217;s author, State Senator Charles Schwertner, said in February. Four months later, Texas has put its faith in the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; to strengthen its financials and act as an effective hedge against inflation. It&#8217;s worth noting that although Texas is the third US state to create a Bitcoin reserve (after Arizona and New Hampshire), it&#8217;s the first to create a publicly-funded reserve. Neither of the other two has allocated public funds for the purchase of Bitcoin. By putting actual taxpayer dollars into $BTC, Texas has not only officially recognized Bitcoin as a store of value but also signaled its unwavering trust and long-term commitment to the digital asset. A publicly-funded reserve is also likely to increase demand for Bitcoin. It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that large public companies like Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy have aggressively bought Bitcoin over the past few months. With here are some of the best new cryptos you can buy to benefit from Bitcoin&#8217;s growing acceptance among corporations and government agencies. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) \u2013 Best Crypto to Buy Now, Get Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to invest in if you want to eke out the maximum amount of returns possible from Bitcoin&#8217;s bull run. $BTCBULL&#8217;s biggest selling point is that it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto on the market right now, offering free (and completely legit) $BTC to its token holders. If you&#8217;re a $BTCBULL holder who has stored his tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll receive your share of free $BTC (depending on your $BTCBULL holdings) every time the king cryptocurrency reaches a landmark, such as $150K and $200K, for the first time. Thanks to its never-before-seen approach to rallying behind Bitcoin and community rewards, BTC Bull Token is predicted to explode 270% and reach $0.0096 by 2026. A huge reason behind this is the project&#8217;s deflationary model, which will burn a part of the total $BTCBULL token supply at regular intervals, creating a supply shortage and hiking prices. The best part? $BTCBULL is currently in presale, where it has raised over $7.2M. Each token is priced at $0.002575, and here&#8217;s how to buy it. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) \u2013 Building Layer 2 on Bitcoin for Scalability &#38; Fast Transactions Despite being the OG blockchain, Bitcoin has been struggling with slow transaction speeds and high fees, as well as limited compatibility with decentralized applications and Web3. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). By building a Bitcoin Layer 2 and connecting it to the Layer 1 using a Canonical Bridge and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, Bitcoin Hyper aims to bring programmability and scalability to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Plus, it will do so without impacting the network&#8217;s security and decentralization benefits. Here&#8217;s how it works: You send $BTC through the Canonical Bridge, which converts it into wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can use wrapped $BTC to access high-speed DeFi apps, pay for transactions on the L2, etc. When you&#8217;re done, just raise a withdrawal request on the L2 network. It will again use a smart contract to verify the transaction and convert wrapped $BTC back to original $BTC. Luckily for you, one $HYPER is currently available for just $0.011975 (the token could soar 2,000% by 2030), and the project has in total raised over $1.5M. Here&#8217;s how to buy it. 3. Tutorial ($TUT) \u2013 Educating Folks About Everything Crypto Tutorial ($TUT) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of crypto&#8217;s growth and increasing awareness among the masses. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s an AI-powered tool that educates people about different crypto-related topics and tools, including setting up a crypto wallet. Other &#8216;tutorials&#8217; in its repertoire include teaching people how to write smart contracts, trade on the best decentralized exchanges, and learn everything there is to know about the BNB chain ecosystem. $TUT has been on a sensational run of late, gaining more than 25% over just the past 7 days. It&#8217;s currently trading at $0.03583, offering a discounted entry point before it explodes to mimic crypto&#8217;s rise. As States Back $BTC, Altcoins Emerge as Attractive Investments With regulated, state-backed crypto holdings becoming increasingly mainstream, we&#8217;re clearly headed towards a world where diversified crypto assets (the best altcoins included) are looked at as both stores of value and investment opportunities. However, make sure you do your own research and due diligence before investing in crypto. The market is highly uncertain, and our article isn&#8217;t financial advice."

      "title": "Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bears-washed-out-bitcoin/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s narrow price movement over the past week contradicts a much different development in the futures market. According to Axel Adler Jr., an analyst at on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, a sharp rise in the long liquidation dominance metric could set the stage for a significant shift in sentiment that may completely wash out bears from the market. Adler shared the data in a recent post on X, accompanied by a chart showing previous points that resemble the current setup. Long Liquidation Spike Without Price Crash The dominance of long liquidations has jumped from 0% to +10% over the past seven days, a move that typically shows distress among bullish traders. However, what makes the current development especially noteworthy is the absence of a steep crash in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Instead, in the just concluded week, Bitcoin held mostly within the $103,000 to $106,000 range until a recent drop, despite facing increasing pressure from long-side liquidations. Related Reading: XRP Daily RSI Trendline Breaks Down \u2013 What It Means For Price Axel Adler Jr. explained that this sustained liquidation of long positions without a full-blown price collapse indicates sustained buyer support. According to data from CryptoQuant, BTC\u2019s long liquidations hit 2,200 BTC, the highest in the past week. Usually, a surge in long liquidations suggests that traders who were anticipating a price rally are being pushed out of their positions under pressure. The CryptoQuant chart below shows how spikes in long liquidation dominance, especially in the 15% to 20% range, have always preceded bullish reversals. According to the analyst, if this metric rises by another 5\u20137%, it could cause a high-probability scenario where bearish positions are washed out and flip Bitcoin\u2019s price movements in favor of the bulls. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Large Wallets Accumulate As Retail Exits Data from Santiment, another on-chain analytics platform, shows an interesting dynamic playing out among Bitcoin holders. Over the past ten days, wallets holding over 10 BTC have increased by 231 addresses, which is a 0.15% rise. Meanwhile, smaller retail wallets containing between 0.001 and 10 BTC have dropped by 37,465 in the same timeframe. This trend highlights a divergence in sentiment between large and retail holders. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break? According to Santiment, the shift where whales and sharks accumulate while retail exits is a bullish combination for Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s market value is hovering just below $104,000 during this accumulation phase, and there could be an eventual upward breakout once retail holders begin to reenter. Image From X: Santiment Despite the underlying on-chain strength, Bitcoin\u2019s spot price has taken a short-term hit in the past 48 hours. During this timeframe, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has slipped below support levels between $106,000 and $103,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,670, down by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. The decline can be largely attributed to recent U.S. strikes on Iran. The U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (June 21-22) caused immediate risk aversion across markets. Bitcoin fell 3.2% after announcements of the strikes, much like its 6% drop during similar 2020 Iran tensions. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-hit-9-days-inflow-streak-despite-price/",
      "summary": "The spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been in good form over the past few weeks, receiving renewed interest from investors in the United States. This recent spurt of momentum has been a rare bright spark in the crypto market, which has been overwhelmed with investor uncertainty lately. Interestingly, the typically straight line between the spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 performance and the BTC price action has not been particularly straight in the past few weeks. While the crypto-linked financial products have shone in the past few days, the underlying premier cryptocurrency has seen better days. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $1 Billion In The Past Week According to the latest market data, the US-based spot Bitcoin ETF market recorded a total net inflow of $6.37 million on Friday, June 20. This performance marked the ninth successive day of positive capital influx for the crypto investment products, signaling increased investor interest and demand. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets SoSoValue data shows that BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) was the only BTC exchange-traded fund with net inflow on Friday. The trillion-dollar asset manager\u2019s fund added a remarkable $46.91 million in value to close the week, as it continues to lead the pack in net assets. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was the only other Bitcoin ETF that recorded any activity on Friday. According to market data, the second-largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund by net assets posted a daily net outflow of $40.55 million on the day. Nonetheless, the $6.37 million single-day performance pushed the US-based Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 weekly record above the $1 billion mark. While this figure falls short of the exchange-traded funds\u2019 performance ($1.39 billion) in the previous week, it still represents a trend in the right direction after enduring two weeks of nearly $300 million in outflows. Bitcoin Price Falls Below $101,000 Level Despite the positive performances of the US-based Bitcoin ETFs, BTC\u2019s price has continued to struggle to build any sustained bullish momentum over the past two weeks. The flagship cryptocurrency seemed set for another trip to a new all-time-high price earlier this week before succumbing to some bearish pressure mid-week. In the late hours of Saturday, the price of BTC fell to below the $101,500 level as another wave of downward pressure hit the crypto market. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $101,484, reflecting an almost 2% price decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin is down by nearly 4% in the past seven days.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-cracks-below-key-structure-head-and-shoulders-breakdown-points-to-106/",
      "summary": "Solana has broken down decisively, losing a critical support level following news that the United States launched an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. The unexpected geopolitical development triggered widespread panic across financial markets, with altcoins taking the hardest hit. Solana, in particular, has seen significant selling pressure, dropping 20% from its May high of approximately $185 and now trading near $148. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom \u2013 All Eyes On Next Move This breakdown confirms investor concerns that SOL&#8217;s uptrend has weakened. Top analyst Carl Runefelt noted that Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern\u2014a bearish technical structure often signaling deeper downside. The price has broken below the neckline of this pattern, confirming the potential for continued declines in the short term. Adding to the bearish outlook is Solana&#8217;s inability to reclaim its prior support levels during brief bounces. With momentum indicators turning negative and broader market sentiment rattled, the likelihood of a swift recovery appears slim unless macro conditions stabilize. Solana Faces Deeper Correction As Bearish Pattern Unfolds Solana\u2019s bullish momentum from late 2024 has all but faded, replaced by stagnation and sharp corrections as market conditions worsen. Now trading more than 50% below its all-time high, SOL continues to struggle under the weight of global macroeconomic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions. The US military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities has only added to the volatility, sending shockwaves through both traditional and crypto markets. While Solana was one of the strongest performers during the previous cycle, its price action has turned decisively bearish in recent weeks. Bulls have failed to maintain critical support levels, and the asset has now broken below its short-term trend structures. According to Runefelt, Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern, a classic technical signal that often precedes a prolonged downtrend. The pattern\u2019s neckline has been breached, and the projected bearish target now stands around $106.30\u2014a level not seen since February. The breakdown also reflects broader weakness in the altcoin market. Despite earlier hopes for an altseason, capital has rotated out of risk assets, favoring Bitcoin and stablecoins amid uncertainty. Solana&#8217;s inability to reclaim prior highs or establish higher lows points to a market in retreat. Momentum indicators continue to flash red, and unless bulls reclaim lost ground quickly, SOL could be facing an extended period of consolidation or further losses. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% \u2013 Smart Contract Activity Accelerates SOL Price Analysis: Breaking Below Key Support Solana is under pressure as it breaks below the critical 200-day simple moving average (SMA) around $149.54, a level that had previously acted as dynamic support. This breakdown signals growing bearish sentiment as price action confirms a loss of momentum following weeks of consolidation below the $155\u2013$160 resistance zone. As of now, SOL is trading at approximately $135.99, down nearly 3% on the day and over 20% from its May highs. The chart shows a rejection near the 100-day SMA (green line), and the sustained move below both the 200-day and 50-day SMAs (blue line) points to a shifting structure, leaning heavily toward the downside. Volume remains elevated on red candles, confirming that the breakdown is supported by increasing sell pressure rather than a low-liquidity move. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason If the current trend continues, Solana could revisit the $120\u2013$125 range, which previously served as strong support in early Q1 2025. The broader context of macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tension, particularly the recent U.S. attack on Iran, adds to investor unease across risk assets, including altcoins like Solana. A daily close back above $149 would be needed to neutralize the short-term bearish structure and shift sentiment. Until then, downside risks dominate.
