      "summary": "Amid the tension in the Iran-Israel conflict, the cryptocurrency market experienced another daily pullback. Bitcoin (BTC), which had just recovered from Friday\u2019s drop, erased its recent gains and recorded a 4.5% dip to the $103,000 mark in the past 24 hours. However, some analysts believe that the flagship crypto is preparing for a big move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes Big Move As Price Compresses Between Key Levels \u2013 $2,100 Or $4,000 Next? Bitcoin Could See Massive Move Soon On Monday, Bitcoin attempted to break its post-November range high but failed to hold the $108,000-$109,000 area as support for the fourth time in a month, falling back into its larger range. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that this resistance level remains a key area to watch, adding that \u201cwithout a clean break above, it&#8217;s not the time to get excited just yet.\u201d Nonetheless, the trader considers that the BTC is \u201csetting up for a large move\u201d as the cryptocurrency continues to hold its monthly range between $100,000 and $110,000. He asserted that this range will break &#8220;at some point in June,\u201d as well as the current weekly high and low, which have \u201ca very low probability of being held\u201d in the coming days. Daan added that a break from these levels is highly possible in the next 1-2 weeks, likely leading to a big move in the direction of the break. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted the crypto market\u2019s performance and investors\u2019 concerns amid the war-related headlines, noting that Bitcoin reacted in a similar pattern during past geopolitical and crypto-related events. According to the analyst, global events\u2019 uncertainty has led to mass liquidation and on-chain panic multiple times since 2020, leading to 30%-50% crashes. However, the market has recovered from these events after significant accumulation. Here\u2019s the pattern: Big event (Black Swan). Panic headlines. Sharp BTC dump. Retail Panic sells. Smart money buys. Time passes. Bitcoin hits new highs. Based on this, Sjuul forecasted a strong Bitcoin pump and a new all-time high (ATH) once the current war tensions are over. BTC Holds Key Support Amid Pullback Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin has been retesting its old range high as support for the past six weeks and showing stability around the $104,400 level during this period. According to the analyst, as long as BTC\u2019s price Weekly Closes above this level, the candle wicks below it are \u201cjust noise\u201d and it is positioned to transition into its Second Price Discovery Uptrend. He also pointed out that the cryptocurrency has only seen a less than 10% dip during the recent pullbacks. Moreover, these drop depths have also been diminishing, with the first rejection producing a 7.72% drop and the second dip being 5.79% deep, while the current rejection has seen a 4.5% retrace so far. Rekt Capital considers the strongest support to be between the $102,000-$104,000 area, and the final level to break is the range high resistance of $108,890. Related Reading: XRP Must Complete Right Shoulder Before Takeoff\u2014But How Low First? &#8220;As long as this resistance isn&#8217;t rejecting price too much, then maybe it&#8217;s getting weaker over time,\u201d he affirmed, concluding that a weekly close above this level would be \u201ca very strong sign for a reclaim of this resistance into new support to springboard price higher.\u201d As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,085, a 1.1% jump in the past hour.

      "summary": "Bitcoin may be gearing up for a renewed surge, but according to trader Josh Olszewicz, the bullish setup is walking a macroeconomic tightrope\u2014and one wrong move could send everything tumbling. In his June 16 \u201cMacro Monday\u201d update, Olszewicz laid out a broad-based technical and macroeconomic case for why BTC is holding firm near all-time highs, while warning that the market\u2019s resilience is underpinned by a single, fragile macro factor: liquidity. $150K Bitcoin? Only If Powell Doesn\u2019t Pull The Plug \u201cCrypto clearly doesn&#8217;t care. Legacy clearly doesn&#8217;t care,\u201d Olszewicz said, referring to the continued rally in risk assets despite no rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. \u201cBoth of those are mooning without rates coming down.\u201d The key, according to him, lies in the quiet resurgence of global liquidity. While the Fed has not yet pivoted to easing, and markets are pricing near-zero odds of cuts in the June or July FOMC meetings, US and global liquidity metrics have started to turn upward. Olszewicz specifically pointed to reverse repo operations and the Treasury General Account (TGA) as crucial levers. \u201cWhen reverse repo drains, it helps liquidity. When TGA spends down, it helps liquidity. Right now, neither is doing much, but both are trending in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s enough to keep risk assets buoyant.\u201d Related Reading: Bitcoin To $140,00 In 50 Days? Bitwise Bets On War Rally The current setup, Olszewicz argued, bears little resemblance to the hard tightening regimes of 2018 or 2022. Globally, rate hike cycles are easing or reversing altogether. \u201cIt has been liquidity going up,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cIf liquidity falls, if rates go up, then I&#8217;d expect crypto to have a hard time.\u201d For Bitcoin, which remains pinned near its all-time high, the structure looks increasingly constructive. The trader noted that BTC has so far resisted any meaningful breakdowns and continues to reclaim key technical levels. \u201cWe&#8217;re hovering at all-time highs. That&#8217;s what you want to see,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to see us just continually fight off these sell-offs. It&#8217;s not a good look to lose highs quickly.\u201d From a technical standpoint, Olszewicz identified $97,980 as the key downside level to watch if Bitcoin does falter. But on the upside, he sees clear potential for continuation: \u201cI like $122K as a pit stop, and then eventually we\u2019ll settle in probably somewhere in the $150K range if we really get going.\u201d But that path is far from guaranteed. The wildcard in Olszewicz\u2019s framework is US liquidity\u2014a metric he calculates as the Federal Reserve balance sheet minus the TGA and reverse repo. It\u2019s rising, but only modestly. \u201cWe are seeing liquidity start to tick up again back to the top of the range,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing super impressive just yet, but this is very helpful\u2014especially for alts, obviously for BTC, but this is what alts need.\u201d And that\u2019s the catch. If liquidity stalls or reverses\u2014whether due to an unexpected Fed tightening move, a jump in TGA balances around tax deadlines, or a reactivation of reverse repo drains\u2014then the entire crypto rally could be put at risk. \u201cIf this goes to zero,\u201d Olszewicz warned about the reverse repo facility, \u201cthere may be liquidity issues and then they may have to reinstate QE.\u201d Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge He also flagged August as a critical juncture, with a possible US debt ceiling crunch looming. \u201cJust pay attention to what&#8217;s going on going into August, assuming the debt ceiling isn&#8217;t raised,\u201d he said. \u201cHigher the debt, higher the deficit, the more investors move to fixed supply assets. That\u2019s better for crypto.\u201d But none of this guarantees a clean move to $150K. As Olszewicz noted, we\u2019re still waiting on one essential domino to fall: inflation stability. While \u201ctrue inflation\u201d data from independent trackers is hovering in the low 2s, Fed-preferred metrics like CPI and PCE remain volatile. For Powell to act, the data needs to show three to six months of sustained, flatline 2% inflation. \u201cYou do not want 2.3 one month, 2.6 the next month, 2.4, 2.8,\u201d Olszewicz said. \u201cYou want a stable 2%.\u201d Until then, the Fed is likely to hold firm. But the longer Bitcoin maintains momentum without a rate cut, the more market psychology begins to shift\u2014toward a scenario where easing becomes a bonus, not a prerequisite. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing well without rates coming down, why are we rooting for rates to come down?\u201d Olszewicz asked. The answer, for Bitcoin, may come down to just one macro metric: liquidity. If it holds, $150,000 is still very much in play. But if it snaps\u2014so could the cycle.
