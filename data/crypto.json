      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-exchange-outflows-continue-to-rise/",
      "summary": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has not been particularly impressive over the weekend, which has been a somewhat consistent theme of the cryptocurrency market so far in the year 2025. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $108,000 mark, showing signs of indecision amongst the investors. With the coin\u2019s indecisive price action, the conversation has been about when the Bitcoin price will return to its all-time high. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio Below 1: On-Chain Analyst In a July 5 post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost revealed that Bitcoin has continued to flow out of centralized exchanges over the past few months. The online crypto pundit mentioned that this trend reflects the growing confidence of investors in the long term. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio 30DMA, a metric that measures the volume of BTC flowing in and out of centralized exchanges over a period of 30 days. A high ratio (&#62;1) indicates more inflows than outflows into exchanges, signaling increased selling pressure for the premier cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a low ratio (&#60;1) implies that more coins are flowing out of rather than into centralized exchanges. When the Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio has a low value, it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding their coins in the long term. According to Darkfost, the Bitcoin monthly outflow/inflow ratio recently fell to around 0.9, its lowest level since the bear market of 2023. With the metric now beneath the 1 threshold, it means that Bitcoin exchange outflows are dominant, reflecting a strong and sustained demand on the spot market. The on-chain analyst said: As of today, demand remains present as outflows continue to dominate, with a growing number of long-term holders stepping in. Ultimately, Darkfost believes that the confidence being shown in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term promise is expected, considering the growing adoption by major corporations and governments, most notably in the United States. \u201cBTC is gradually evolving into a store of value, increasingly used to strengthen treasury strategies,\u201d the crypto analyst added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $108,103, reflecting a mere 0.3% increase in the past 24 hours.

Adoption Numbers And Hype Based on reports from River, nearly 5% of the world\u2019s population has used or owns Bitcoin so far. That\u2019s a long way from Blockware\u2019s forecast that 10% could be on board by 2030. Those numbers show that while the buzz is loud, real wallets holding Bitcoin remain few. For many, Bitcoin is still a headline rather than a habit. State Level Moves Shift Policy Last month, Texas became the first US state to set up a public Bitcoin stockpile. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21, creating a standalone fund run by state&#8217;s comptroller. That setup keeps the reserve out of the normal state treasury, so it can\u2019t be raided for other expenses. A follow\u2011up bill, HB 4488, cements its legal protection, making sure the fund stays intact no matter what. Not every state has pushed ahead. In May, Florida dropped its crypto legislation, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma in pulling back. Arizona\u2019s House Bill 1025, despite getting farther than any similar measure, was vetoed by US President Donald Trump on May 3. Bitcoin Lyrics Hit Home Drake\u2019s new verse isn\u2019t his first high\u2011stakes play with crypto. Back in 2022, he put $1 million worth of Bitcoin bet on the Super Bowl.

Looking ahead, Drake\u2019s new song and Texas\u2019s reserve show two sides of crypto\u2019s rise. The pop\u2011culture nods pull attention, while real\u2011world policies test whether Bitcoin can move from hype into everyday use. If both trends keep climbing, Bitcoin could win more hearts\u2014and wallets\u2014in the years to come. Featured image from Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty, chart from TradingView"

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/are-bitcoin-retail-traders-back-in-the-market-on-chain-data/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin started the month of July with a convincing rally to the upside, suggesting a sustained bullish sentiment amongst investors from its performance by the end of June. The upward rally, however, cooled off following the release of positive employment data by the United States. Traders might have expected this data to be typically bullish, but that has hardly been the reality for the Bitcoin price. Nevertheless, a certain investor cohort, as shown by on-chain revelation, has decided to return to the market and bet on the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Retail Investors In, Long-Term Holders Out? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha highlighted the increasing divergence between retail and institutional behavior in the BTC market. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Taha started by pointing out that Binance Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has remained below $11.5 billion. The crypto pundit explained that this price level has been acting as strong resistance, as Bitcoin traders have repeatedly closed positions near this price threshold. Interestingly, these levels are very close to the same price region around which resistance was observed on June 10th. Taha stated that this could mean the bullish momentum is beginning to wane for the flagship cryptocurrency. On another hand, short-term holders (STH), who are typically the retail traders, have increased their exposure to the market by about 382,000 BTC. This can only mean that there has been renewed retail interest in the flagship cryptocurrency. Contrary to the short-term holders\u2019 actions, the long-term holders (LTH) reduced their holdings by an amount similar to the STH exposure. Taha explained that this could be a result of profit taking or risk management within this investor class. In essence, the retail investors are \u201cbuying the dip,\u201d while the more experienced are seemingly reducing their risks. Bitcoin Whales Enter Distribution Phase Also supporting the conceived idea of caution in institutions and whales, Taha reported that large holders (holders with over 10,000 BTC) offloaded about 12,000 BTC on the 3rd of July. This kind of move, according to the analyst, signals potential profit taking or perhaps strategic reallocation. Besides what they might signify, large transactions tend to have a substantial impact on market dynamics, as significant amounts of BTC are involved in each trade. However, the large holders were not the only profit takers. According to Taha, mid-sized whales (those holding 1,000-10,000 BTC) also shed some of their holdings. From June 30th, approximately 14,000 BTC were sold by this class. Deducible from these transactions is the idea that the whales seem to be in their distribution phase, either because they anticipate further bearish momentum or await better positioning opportunities. If macro conditions remain favorable, the Bitcoin market could resume its bullish rally, but this ultimately falls on the renewal of larger players&#8217; confidence. For now, the road ahead remains uncertain. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $108,152, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

      "summary": "Bitcoin is currently holding just above the $108,000 level and bulls are maintaining momentum after a volatile start to July. However, a closer look at on-chain data shows how fragile that position might be. Interestingly, two support levels, $106,738 and $98,566, are now the most important zones for bulls to defend. These levels represent clusters of addresses holding large amounts of Bitcoin, and losing them could trigger a deeper correction. Related Reading: XRP\u2019s Time Is Now, Says Pundit\u2014Don\u2019t Snooze On The \u2018Biggest Transfer Of Wealth\u2019 Bitcoin\u2019s Support Clusters Around $106,000 And $98,000 Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to two major support levels based on data showing Bitcoin&#8217;s purchase clusters. This data is based on Sentora\u2019s (previously IntoTheBlock) In/Out of the Money Around Price metric among addresses that bought Bitcoin close to the current price. As shown by the metric, the most important current zones of purchase are at $106,738 and $98,566. These two zones are where massive buying activity has occurred in the past few weeks, and they could act as support in case of a Bitcoin price crash. The first zone, between $104,982 and $108,190, contains 1.68 million addresses with a total volume of 1.28 million BTC at an average price of $106,738. Below the first zone, a larger group of 1.71 million addresses holds a greater volume of 1.25 million BTC within the price range of $95,248 to $98,566, with an average price of $98,566. As long as Bitcoin continues to trade above these levels, the ongoing rally could continue to push upward. However, if these pockets of demand are broken with enough selling pressure, the leading cryptocurrency could enter into an uncertain price zone with little buying interest to provide support. Speaking of selling pressure, on-chain data shows a slowing sell pressure among large holders. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Sentora, Bitcoin recorded its fifth straight week of net outflows from centralized exchanges. The past week alone saw more than $920 million worth of BTC moved into self-custody or institutional products, mostly Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Needs To Break Weekly Resistance For New Highs Even with solid demand zones beneath, Bitcoin\u2019s path to new highs is not yet confirmed. Analyst Rekt Capital weighed in with his analysis, noting that Bitcoin is currently facing a strong weekly resistance band just under $109,000. Particularly, Bitcoin is at risk of a lower high structure on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart. Rekt Capital noted that a weekly close above the red horizontal resistance line must be achieved in order for Bitcoin to reclaim a more bullish stance. That resistance, which is currently around $108,890, is acting as a ceiling for Bitcoin\u2019s upward rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest As such, Bitcoin would need to make a weekly close above $108,890 to position itself for new all-time highs. Unless there is a convincing break of that level, the price action of Bitcoin could be erratic and susceptible to a retracement to $106,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,160.

[screenshot this] \u2014 Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) July 3, 2025 Other users have pushed back, asking what on\u2011chain data or metrics back up this view. They point out that until Bitcoin clears resistance at $110,500, a real breakout isn\u2019t confirmed. Based on reports from market trackers, global liquidity is on the rise. Market observers picked up on that, saying more cash floating around can push Bitcoin higher. Rising liquidity often fuels big moves in risk assets. Still, traders keep an eye on futures funding rates and miner sell\u2011pressure, looking for clues if a pullback is brewing. Global Liquidity just hit a new ATH. Bitcoin will follow! pic.twitter.com/gH1Kl2D1Zw \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) July 3, 2025 Mixed Views Online Some followers argue that inflation and new tariffs could dampen Bitcoin\u2019s rally. Others note that central banks are still buying time before any rate hikes, which may give crypto another boost. The back\u2011and\u2011forth on social media reads like a mini war room, with short comments and deep threads floating around. Plenty of voices, but few hard answers. Past Bull Runs Altcoin Daily wasn\u2019t shy about past calls either. Just days earlier, they said that once Bitcoin tops $150,000, investors would wish they\u2019d bought more at lower prices. That kind of hindsight talk can be stirring, but it doesn\u2019t change the here\u2011and\u2011now charts or the macro calendar. Exec Calls For Hedge Based on remarks by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, now could be a good time to buy Bitcoin. Hougan pointed to Ray Dalio\u2019s warnings about US debt, which has swelled past $7 trillion in annual spending against $5 trillion in revenue. With each household on the hook for roughly $230,000, Dalio says holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against future money\u2011print risks.
