      "summary": "The Bitcoin Options traders have been pricing in low implied volatility, but on-chain data shows a setup ripe for amplified price swings. Bitcoin Options ATM IV Has Been Trending Lower In its latest weekly report, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin looks from the perspective of on-chain analysis. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400? On-Chain Shows No Big Hurdles Ahead The indicator shared by Glassnode is the Realized Supply Density, which tells us about how concentrated the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply is around the current spot price. When the value of this metric is high, it means the investors have participated in a large amount of buying at or near the asset&#8217;s latest price. &#8220;In such environments, even modest price fluctuations can affect a broad swath of investors, often amplifying market sensitivity and, in turn, volatility potential,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by in the report. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Supply Density has gone through an uplift during the past few weeks, which suggests accumulation has taken place around the current spot price. &#8220;This concentration raises the probability of outsized reactions to price movements, increasing volatility risk in the near term,&#8221; notes Glassnode. While on-chain data may hint that volatility could go up in the future, it would appear the traders on the Options market don&#8217;t quite think the same, as the At-The-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IV) has been going down. The IV is a metric that represents the traders&#8217; expectations of how volatile Bitcoin will be over a given period, based on the pricing of Options contracts. The ATM version of the indicator specifically calculates this expectation based on Options closest to the latest spot price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back At $109,000, But HODLer Profit-Taking Down 89% Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Options ATM IV across different expiration timeframes: From the above graph, it&#8217;s apparent that the Bitcoin Options ATM IV has been going down for all major tenors, an indication that the traders don&#8217;t expect high volatility for the cryptocurrency in the near future. &#8220;Historically, such complacency in volatility pricing has often served as a counter-trend signal, preceding periods of heightened volatility,&#8221; says the analytics firm. With on-chain data suggesting increased volatility risk and this signal forming at the same time, it now remains to be seen how Bitcoin would develop in the coming days.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback Ethereum Breakout Eyes $3,100 Ethereum has reclaimed the key $2,800 barrier for the first time since February, nearing the $2,900 level on Wednesday morning. The King of Altcoins had been trading between the $2,475-$2,680 range since its May breakout, unable to turn the range\u2019s upper boundary into support. During last week\u2019s retracement, ETH dropped to the $2,400 support before bouncing over the weekend. The crypto market\u2019s recovery saw Ethereum surge toward the key resistance, finally breaking past it at the start of the week and hitting a three-month high of $2,879 today. Following this performance, Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show noted that the cryptocurrency had broken out of an ascending triangle formation and now targets the $3,100 resistance. The analyst previously highlighted ETH\u2019s triangle pattern, which began forming at the start of last month\u2019s recovery rally. During that period, the price compressed between the support and resistance lines, with the latter situated around the $2,700 mark. He forecasted a 15% surge toward the $3,100 level if the altcoin reclaimed the crucial resistance level. Based on this, Ethereum could climb another 10.7% if it holds its current range. Runefelt also pointed out another bullish formation in ETH\u2019s trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC). According to the ETH/BTC chart, Ethereum also formed a bullish pennant pattern during the May rally. Amid this week\u2019s recovery, the cryptocurrency has broken out of the formation\u2019s upper boundary, eyeing a 30% surge toward the 0.03300 mark. ETH To Repeat History? Market Watcher Kaleo highlighted the resemblance between ETH\u2019s performance between 2020 and 2025. According to the analyst, there are \u201ca lot of similarities on the chart to where we are now vs. where we were in 2020.\u201d As he explained, in the Spring of 2020, Ethereum experienced a major sell-off, fueled by the COVID-19 crash, which sent its price below a key higher timeframe (HFT) support. However, once the ascending trendline was reclaimed as support, ETH was \u201cup only for the next 20 months.\u201d Kaleo detailed the recent sell-off, caused by the Trump Tariffs scare, sent the altcoin below its multi-year ascending support trendline, adding that \u201cETH is currently on the verge of reclaiming that line.\u201d Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 \u2013 Is A Recovery Around The Corner? The analyst suggested that if history repeats, investors could see \u201canother great ETH bull run and accompanying alt season.\u201d Meanwhile, analyst DonAlt affirmed that ETH\u2019s chart looks \u201cpretty good\u201d amid its HTF range reclaim. To him, a new all-time high (ATH) is likely if the $3,800 resistance is reclaimed, while the rally\u2019s invalidation level is a close below the $2,200 mark.

At the time of writing, the crypto is trading at $109,693, reflecting a 0.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite this upward movement, the current price remains roughly 2% below its all-time high of over $111,000, recorded last month. This ongoing strength in price performance has been accompanied by notable on-chain signals, particularly from large holders. CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan recently analyzed the current market structure and behavior of Bitcoin whales. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers From $100K Dip While On-Chain Data Shows Rising Miner Activity Bitcoin Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside In his latest analysis, Dan observed that despite Bitcoin hovering near record levels, there is little evidence of the profit-taking behavior typically observed during previous market tops.

Dan emphasized that these large holders are likely waiting for more pronounced market euphoria and higher valuations before initiating substantial sell activity, a pattern often seen near the final stages of a bull market. Bitcoin &#8211; Near All-Time Highs but No Profit-Taking \u201cWhales show no intention of taking profits at this price level and are likely to wait for higher prices, where significant market overheating and a bubble form, before making their moves.\u201d \u2013 By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/W5PtrHo0Q5 \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 Whale Exchange Activity Indicates Similar Move Further reinforcing the current sentiment, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a significant trend in Binance whale behavior. According to Darkfost, historical data shows that when Bitcoin approaches or breaches its all-time high, there is typically a sharp rise in exchange inflows, driven by whales seeking to take profits. This pattern was visible during earlier cycle peaks, where inflows reached $5.3 billion in early 2024, and even higher levels of $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion in previous cycles. A strong bullish signal from Binance whales! \u201cToday, however, inflows are just around $3 billion and are continuing to decline, suggesting that these whales prefer to keep holding.\u201d \u2013 By @Darkfost_Coc Full analysis \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/T1FlLnM4nK pic.twitter.com/O3XrqhAyEc \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 In contrast, recent inflows to Binance remain substantially lower. Darkfost reports current inflows hovering around $3 billion, and more importantly, on a declining trajectory. This divergence from historical patterns suggests that whales are refraining from selling at current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Their reduced activity implies an expectation that higher prices may lie ahead, and that they are positioning for potentially greater returns later in the cycle.

On June 6, the network saw 4.50 million returning user addresses. Those stats suggest people keep coming back to DeFi apps on Tron, but it\u2019s worth watching whether those funds stay in place or chase higher yields on other chains. Bullish Bets in Derivatives Based on CoinGlass data, TRX derivatives open interest rose by 8.25% over the past 24 hours to $329 million. The weighted funding rate open interest rose to 0.0098%, indicative that bullish long positions are greater than shorts. Short liquidations in the past day were almost double that of longs, which settled a bearish bet wave. Technical analysis supports this positive perspective. The RSI on the daily chart is inching up to the overbought region, indicating heightened buying pressure. A recent MACD crossover drove histogram bars into positive territory, which means momentum has favored the buyers. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million?

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-tests-ascending-channel-resistance-breakout-or-breakdown/",
      "summary": "Ethereum pushed above the $2,820 mark yesterday, strengthening the bullish case for a breakout after weeks of consolidation. The move has created renewed optimism among traders who expect ETH to rally beyond its current range and begin a new upward leg. Despite lingering global tensions, markets are responding positively to growing speculation that a trade deal between the US and China may soon be finalized, offering a temporary boost to risk assets across the board. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level \u2013 Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Ethereum\u2019s recent strength comes at a critical moment, as price approaches the upper boundary of its current ascending channel. Top analyst M-log1 shared a technical analysis highlighting this structure, stating that ETH needs to break out of this current channel. Until then, price action may remain contained within the structure, with limited upside unless a decisive breakout occurs. As Ethereum pushes toward resistance, all eyes are on volume and confirmation signals that could mark the start of a broader trend. For bulls, breaking above the ascending channel could signal the beginning of a strong move toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, Ethereum remains at a key inflection point in its cycle. Ethereum Holds The Key To Altseason Ts Bulls Eye Breakout Ethereum is now at the center of the market\u2019s attention, as its next move could determine whether a true altseason begins. While Bitcoin continues to lead, Ethereum\u2019s ability to reclaim higher price levels\u2014particularly above the $2,800 mark\u2014will be critical in confirming the start of a broader altcoin rally. So far, positive sentiment and rising price action suggest momentum is building, with ETH pushing into resistance and forming a constructive setup. Bulls have regained control in recent sessions, but the challenge now lies in escaping the current structure. M-log1 highlighted that Ethereum remains trapped in an ascending channel, a pattern that often leads to slow grinding moves until a breakout or breakdown occurs. \u201cIf we want anything significant to happen,\u201d he noted, \u201cthen ETH needs to leave this ascending channel.\u201d Failing to do so increases the probability of a revisit to the lower end of the range, though M-log1 clarified that this isn\u2019t a certainty\u2014just a probability to keep in mind. On a positive note, Ethereum\u2019s moving averages continue to trend upward and support price from below, providing a favorable technical backdrop. As long as these levels hold and bulls remain active, the breakout scenario remains the dominant outlook. If ETH can decisively flip $2,800 into support and break above the channel structure, it could unleash a wave of capital rotation into altcoins. Until then, Ethereum holds the spotlight\u2014and its next move will likely shape the direction of the entire market heading into summer. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level \u2013 No Clear Breakout Yet Ethereum Breaks Above Resistance But Faces Retest At Key Level Ethereum is currently trading at $2,771 on the daily chart after briefly breaking above the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This level has capped price action multiple times since early May, making this breakout attempt a significant development. However, today\u2019s rejection from a high of $2,834 suggests that ETH is not yet ready to confirm a clean breakout and may be entering a short-term retest phase. The $2,750\u2013$2,800 zone, now acting as immediate resistance, aligns closely with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,654.52 \u2014 a historically important level that often dictates medium-term trend direction. ETH\u2019s recent surge above all major moving averages, including the 50-day ($2,333.32) and 100-day ($2,085.42) SMAs, reflects growing bullish momentum and a strong trend structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens \u2013 Tower Top Pattern In Play? If Ethereum holds above the 200-day SMA on a retest and reclaims $2,800 with follow-through, the path toward $3,000 becomes more realistic. On the other hand, failure to hold this area could result in a slide back toward the $2,600\u2013$2,650 support zone. Volume has picked up, indicating interest, but confirmation will come from sustained price above resistance. For now, ETH remains in a promising position \u2014 but the next few candles will be key.
