      "summary": "Dogecoin edged up slightly to $0.17 on Friday, gaining 1.0% in the last 24 hours. Trading has thinned out this week, and Dogecoin has slipped almost 3% over the past seven days. Based on reports, investors are moving carefully as volume dropped 30% to about $678 million. Related Reading: Iran\u2019s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links\u2014Details Trading Volume Drop Signals Caution According to on\u2011chain data, the slump in daily volume shows fewer traders are stepping in.

When fewer coins change hands, even modest buys or sells can push prices sharply in either direction. #Dogecoin $DOGE looks prime for a 60% price move!

Prices have carved lower highs and higher lows as trendlines converge. Data from crypto analyst Ali shows, this narrowing range often precedes a major move. He notes the tip of the triangle is due by June 2025, which puts a deadline on when volatility should pick up. DOGE Bulls Eye Breakout According to Ali\u2019s analysis, a daily close above $0.22 likely signals a bullish breakout. If that happens, he sees Dogecoin reaching roughly $0.35 or $0.36\u2014about 60% higher than current levels. On the flip side, a drop below $0.16 could spark a sell\u2011off toward $0.10. Investors are watching those exact levels to decide whether to join buyers or cut losses. DOGE Price Forecast Digital Coin Price is on the optimistic end. They predict Dogecoin could go past $0.37 before year\u2011end and even test its old high of $0.74 again. Market Catalysts Could Tip The Scales Dogecoin\u2019s swings often mirror the wider crypto space or follow social media buzz. A surge in Bitcoin or Ethereum prices could carry DOGE higher, while a broader sell\u2011off would magnify losses. Some traders also keep an eye on endorsements from well\u2011known figures and major exchange listings.

      "summary": "CryptoInsightUK\u2019s latest market briefing arrives with the sound of literal hammer blows next door, an accidental soundtrack to the pounding he expects traders to take before the next rally. In a thirteen\u2013minute walkthrough of XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity maps, the British analyst argues that the market is staging what he calls \u201ca deliberate trap\u201d designed to flush out weak hands, harvest stop-loss orders and maximise upside leverage for larger players\u2014leaving retail participants \u201cscreaming, \u2018Yay, we\u2019re going to the upside,\u2019 \u2026 only to find out they\u2019ve been played.\u201d The Trap Is Set, Warns XRP Trader He begins with XRP\u2019s five-month down-channel that started at the New-Year peak, noting that price continues to hug the underside of a descending trend line. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck below that trend line basically looking to see if this liquidity is going to get taken below us. My obvious opinion is that it is,\u201d he says, underscoring the conviction that a sweep of resting bids below remains the path of least resistance. The flush, he contends, would \u201cmake our journey to the upside much better and much easier to navigate,\u201d because it would reset funding, scare out late longs and reload the order book for what he still calls the next \u201cparabolic expansion probably up towards the $8 to $12 region.\u201d Related Reading: \u2018Out of Time\u2019: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts The trap, however, may not be a straightforward vertical collapse. Charts, he reminds viewers, \u201clove doing something like\u201d an initial breakout that rallies 15-20%, convinces traders the bear-phase is finished, and then abruptly reverses into the deep liquidity pocket below. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how higher-highs-and-higher-lows type situations are supposed to get you frustrated,\u201d he says, openly conceding that the pattern looks engineered. The phrase he never uses\u2014manipulation\u2014hovers unspoken over the analysis, but his rhetoric leaves little doubt: \u201cThis is how they test everybody.\u201d Bitcoin, in his narrative, may serve as the decoy that sets the trap. The benchmark asset has already slipped out of its own wedge-like consolidation and, he observes, \u201cdoes like to do this sort of thing\u201d by staging premature upside breaks. He sketches a possible march toward $115,000 that would \u201cdelay the inevitable\u201d and then give way to a liquidity hunt of its own. Even so, his mid-cycle price band for Bitcoin remains $150,000 to $220,000. That upside, he argues, justifies dollar-cost-averaging into altcoins even while keeping \u201ca tiny bit of dry powder\u201d in reserve for the washout he expects. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 A more elaborate scenario involves a temporary dominance surge in Bitcoin to the 66 to 74% range. As Bitcoin siphons capital, alts such as XRP would \u201cbleed out,\u201d take the downside liquidity target, and only then reverse as cash rotates back into their order books. He illustrates the dance on twin TradingView panels\u2014Bitcoin on the left, XRP on the right\u2014before concluding that the rotational setup is \u201cnot highly likely\u201d because it requires several macro-scale dominoes to fall in sequence. Still, he refuses to dismiss it, pointing to the strategic reserve bill in Washington as the sort of narrative catalyst that could spark a temporary Bitcoin-only rally and demoralise alt-holders. Macro-risk flickers through the commentary\u2014wars that could \u201cshove us down\u201d in the near term\u2014but he treats geopolitical stress as a catalyst for final capitulation rather than a thesis-killer. \u201cThe upside is so large it almost can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d he insists, framing the present chop as a high-volatility pause before a structural up-leg. Whether that leg begins only after a full flush or emerges from yet another fake-out remains uncertain, but the analyst\u2019s message is unmistakable: traders who chase breakouts without accounting for hidden hands risk being liquidated first, spectators to the parabola they hoped to ride. For now he is content to wait \u201cfor the market to do its worst trick,\u201d believing that the final shakeout will announce itself through a sudden, depth-piercing wick. \u201cYou\u2019re being played,\u201d he warns. The admonition is stark: if the playbook unfolds as expected, the pain will be quick. \u201cIf we get these levels, that\u2019s where I\u2019m putting the last bit of my dry powder in[&#8230;].

      "summary": "According to an analyst on X, Bitcoin\u2019s grip on the market looks too strong for altcoins to break free any time soon. Bitcoin\u2019s price ticked up to around $104,000 after climbing 0.4%. It had dipped briefly to $103,000 but buyers stepped in fast.

The other is a 21\u2011week exponential moving average. Together they form a zone that Bitcoin Dominance has used as a springboard all year.

Bitcoinsensus warns dominance could \u201cfall off a cliff\u201d before any altcoin season kicks off. That view suggests a sudden drop, maybe giving altcoins their moment. An analyst points to a possible double\u2011top pattern in dominance. If Bitcoin can\u2019t clear resistance, money might flow into altcoins. But if dominance breaks higher, some believe Bitcoin could aim for a fresh record. Limitations Of Dominance Metric Dominance only measures Bitcoin\u2019s share of total crypto market cap. It can slip if stablecoins flood in or if new tokens launch, even when altcoins aren\u2019t rallying. And a rise in dominance can mean altcoins are selling off. Related Reading: Iran\u2019s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links\u2014Details Traders should know that moving\u2011average support lines can fail in choppy markets. A pattern that works for months can break when the climate changes. In the end, the Bull Market Support Band offers a clear trend line. It shows that Bitcoin is still the favorite for many investors. Yet relying on one technical tool can miss bigger moves driven by real\u2011world news or fresh blockchain data. For now, though, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance looks safe\u2014unless something big shifts in the weeks ahead. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView"

      "title": "Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again",
      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bullish-divergence/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin is currently hovering in a tightly compressed price range after failing multiple times to break above $110,000 earlier this month. The past few days have been characterized by the leading cryptocurrency trading around $105,000, with neither bulls nor bears taking control. Despite the overall consolidation, a subtle yet significant signal is starting to flash beneath the surface, particularly on the 4-hour chart, that might send Bitcoin to a new all-time high soon. Return Of Rare Divergence Pattern On Bitcoin\u2019s 4H Chart Crypto analyst Luca (@CrypticTrades_) took to social media platform X to share a chart that highlights an important technical development on Bitcoin\u2019s 4-hour timeframe: the return of a bullish divergence. This signal, which previously appeared in early April, preceded the massive rally that catapulted Bitcoin to its May 22 all-time high of $111,800. The same divergence is forming once again and another Bitcoin price breakout may be very close. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here As shown in the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart below, the divergence is clearly illustrated between price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Price has been forming lower lows, while the RSI has been printing higher lows. This mismatch serves as an early indicator that selling momentum is fading, and a reversal to the upside could follow. The previous instance of this pattern directly preceded a sharp move from a $74,000 low in early April to above $111,000 in just a few weeks. What Does This Divergence Mean For Bitcoin\u2019s Price? Bullish divergences on mid-timeframe charts like the 4-hour have a reputation for being the first reversal signals when supported by rising volume. In Bitcoin\u2019s current case, the appearance of this pattern again could mean that the recent retracement from $111,800 has run its course. With RSI now trending upward even as price presses slightly lower, Bitcoin may be witnessing another hidden accumulation phase before its next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News If the pattern holds true to its previous performance in April, the leading cryptocurrency could be setting up for another push toward new all-time high levels. Bitcoin is currently not far off from a new all-time high, as it is only about 5.5% away from its price peak. Based on this, another strong breakout could easily aim beyond the previous $111,800 high. Although Bitcoin\u2019s price is relatively stagnant for now, the presence of this bullish divergence is a reminder of how quickly things can change. The previous bullish divergence ended up with a 50% price surge. A similar performance from the current price level would translate to another target above $160,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,700, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours, already showing signs of the bullish divergence signal coming into action.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-analyst-sees-123-and-116-as-mid-zone-support-levels-heres-why/",
      "summary": "Solana is currently testing a critical demand zone near the $150 level after enduring weeks of persistent selling pressure and a broader shift in market sentiment. The asset is now trading roughly 20% below its May high of $185, with recent attempts at recovery facing strong resistance. Despite holding above major support for now, the overall structure suggests that downside risk remains if market conditions don\u2019t improve soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close \u2013 Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent Top analyst Efloud shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the importance of tracking Solana\u2019s response to broader Bitcoin dynamics. He noted that if Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate sideways while Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) rises, altcoins like SOL may struggle. In that case, Solana could continue retracing to find stronger support at mid-zones, particularly around the $123 and $116 levels. These price zones have previously acted as solid support/resistance areas and could serve as key inflection points should bearish momentum persist. A breakdown toward these targets would likely coincide with increasing BTC.D and continued investor caution in the altcoin market. Until then, SOL remains vulnerable within a fragile technical structure, and traders will closely watch for either a rebound or deeper correction in the coming days. Solana Holds Key Support As Analysts Eye Bullish Scenarios Solana is currently trading about 50% down from its all-time highs, with the explosive momentum seen at the end of 2024 now replaced by more subdued price action. The asset\u2019s underperformance has left investors cautious, but many analysts remain optimistic about Solana\u2019s potential once a new altcoin rally begins. For now, the focus is on holding critical demand zones that could determine whether SOL is gearing up for a recovery or further downside. According to Efloud, if Bitcoin continues consolidating sideways while Bitcoin dominance rises, Solana may find support at several mid-zones, particularly around $123 and $116. The $140 region has historically acted as a strong support/resistance flip, and a deviation around this level\u2014losing it briefly before regaining it with strength\u2014could present a short-term buying opportunity. Efloud notes that this scenario doesn\u2019t necessarily imply that SOL must drop to those levels, but current market conditions\u2014aside from Bitcoin\u2014lack strong pair structures. If SOL can decisively break above the $168 resistance, a new leg upward could be triggered, with $230 potentially acting as the next major resistance zone. On the SOL/BTC pair, Efloud is watching for a reclaim of the 0.0015 level or a pullback toward 0.00115 for confirmation. Another key support sits at 0.000988 sats. Despite the current cooling, the structure may still offer solid opportunities for new entrants. If these levels hold and macro conditions improve, SOL could be setting the stage for a sustainable rally, ultimately leading to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern \u2013 $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Weekly Chart Analysis \u2013 Holding the Line Near Key Support Solana is currently trading at $148.33 on the weekly timeframe, showing a 3% decline over the past seven days. The price has dropped roughly 20% from its May high of around $185 and is now testing the critical $140\u2013$150 support zone. This level has repeatedly acted as a pivot point in the past and could define SOL\u2019s short-term trajectory. The chart shows that Solana has been unable to reclaim the 50-week moving average (currently near $170), which now acts as key resistance. A decisive weekly close above this level would open the door for a bullish continuation toward $185 and possibly $200. However, failure to hold above the 100-week moving average around $132 could lead to further downside pressure, with $123 and $116 as the next demand zones to watch\u2014levels identified by analyst Efloud in his mid-zone scenario. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low \u2013 No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Volume has declined steadily over the past three weeks, signaling reduced participation, but also suggesting that aggressive selling is fading. If bulls manage to reclaim $160 with conviction, the structure remains favorable. For now, SOL remains in a consolidation phase, awaiting either a breakout or further correction as broader crypto market conditions unfold. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"
