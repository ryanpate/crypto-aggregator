      "summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high (ATH) of $123,218 earlier today, pushing its market cap beyond $2.4 trillion. However, exchange data shows a sharp increase in BTC inflows following this milestone, raising concerns of a potential short-term correction. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Warn Of Pullback According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Tarekonchain, BTC is beginning to show signs of short-term cooling. Notably, exchange inflows recorded a sharp uptick right after Bitcoin hit its fresh ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The following chart shared by the analyst highlights exchange netflows to spot platforms, with notable spikes in inflows to centralized exchanges. This typically indicates profit-taking behavior by short-term holders and some whales. Tarekonchain noted that such on-chain activity is usually indicative of a local top that could lead to a healthy price correction or consolidation in the coming days. They added: It&#8217;s a classic pattern we&#8217;ve seen after previous parabolic rallies &#8211; profits are realized, weak hands exit, and price finds a new base. That said, the analyst noted that despite the warning signs of a looming price correction, the overall market structure remains largely bullish. For instance, long-term holders are still holding their BTC, not keen on selling at current price levels. Supporting the bullish thesis, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to attract strong capital. For the week ending July 11, they saw $2.72 billion in net inflows &#8211; a clear sign of ongoing institutional interest. Whales Preparing To Sell? In a separate post, CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk pointed to an uptick in whale activity on Binance. The Binance Whale Activity Score shows that deposits from large wallets have spiked dramatically. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback Whales reportedly deposited as much as 1,800 BTC to Binance in a single day, with more than 35% of transactions valued at over $1 million, hinting at strategic positioning ahead of expected volatility. Crazzyblockk highlighted two possible scenarios following the surge in deposits from large-scale investors. First, it is likely that these investors are sitting on healthy profits and may be getting ready to secure some gains after a historic run. Alternatively, they might be aiming to leverage Binance\u2019s deep liquidity to hedge or open new positions as the market experiences heightened volatility. Either way, this sell-side pressure on Binance is likely to weigh on BTC\u2019s bullish momentum. Despite rising inflows and increased whale activity, market sentiment remains broadly positive. Retail investor participation is still muted compared to previous bull runs, suggesting the current rally might still have room to grow.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) around $123,000, but cryptocurrency market inflows are still far from the peak observed back in 2024. Crypto Capital Inflows Are Currently Sitting At $51 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, there is a stark difference in capital participation between the current Bitcoin rally and the one from December 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000\u2014But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by the analyst that compares the two bull runs. The graph captures the 30-day capital flows occurring for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. For the former two assets, it tracks them using the Realized Cap indicator. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates a given cryptocurrency&#8217;s total value by assuming that each coin in the circulating supply has its value equal to the last time it changed hands on the network. In short, what the metric represents is the amount of capital that investors of the asset as a whole have put into it. Changes in this indicator, therefore, correspond to the entry or exit of capital into the network. As is visible in the chart, the 30-day Realized Cap change for Bitcoin and Ethereum (colored in orange) has gone up alongside the latest price rally, indicating that capital has flowed into these coins. It&#8217;s also apparent that stablecoin flows (blue) have also noted an uptick, although the scale has been smaller. For stables, capital flow can be directly measured using the market cap, since their price is always pegged to $1 means that the Realized Cap never differs from the market cap. In the cryptocurrency sector, capital mainly comes in through three entry points: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The altcoins usually only receive a rotation of capital from these assets. Since the flows related to the three have recently been positive, the market as a whole has been getting an injection of capital. In total, the aggregate capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have stood at $51.2 billion for the past month. This is certainly a sizeable figure on its own, but it pales in comparison to what was witnessed before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks 8-Year Resistance Line That Failed In 2017-2021 As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, the monthly capital flows peaked at almost $135 billion in the December 2024 Bitcoin rally above $100,000, more than double the latest number. Something to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the previous run was more explosive, while the latest one has come in two waves: an initial recovery surge above $100,000 that led into a consolidation phase and the current breakout into the $120,000 levels. This could, at least in part, explain why the metric has appeared relatively cool recently.

      "summary": "Bitcoin has reached new milestones this week, briefly breaking above the $123,000 mark earlier today before retracing slightly to $121,812 at the time of writing. This follows a week of strong gains, with BTC rising by more than 10% amid a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the minor pullback, market analysts are closely monitoring on-chain and derivatives data to assess whether momentum is building toward a more aggressive phase of the rally. The recent surge has also benefited the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, lifting total global crypto market capitalization to just under $4 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes While Bitcoin continues to dominate in terms of volume and influence, sentiment metrics suggest that traders and investors may still be approaching with measured optimism. According to analysts, several indicators are now pointing to a potential shift in market dynamics that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s next major move. Market Euphoria Not Yet Confirmed CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson has offered insights into the current structure of the Bitcoin market through an analysis of the price gap between spot and perpetual futures contracts on Binance. In a recent QuickTake post, Wedson noted that the spot price of Bitcoin continues to outpace the perpetual futures price, a sign that market sentiment has not yet tipped into full euphoria. Historically, a positive gap between the two markets has signaled increased speculative activity and the onset of parabolic rallies. &#8220;The gap is still in negative territory,&#8221; Wedson stated, \u201cbut the narrowing trend indicates that sentiment may be transitioning from cautious to more optimistic.&#8221; The analysis implies that traders in the futures market have yet to aggressively price in further upside, possibly waiting for stronger confirmation before deploying leverage. Should this gap flip to positive territory, it could be interpreted as a sign of increased risk appetite, potentially fueling a sharper upward move. Wedson also emphasized the importance of monitoring how derivatives markets respond in the coming days. \u201cIf the trend continues and flips positive, we could see a more intense phase of the rally driven by leveraged traders,\u201d he wrote. Until then, the current environment appears to reflect a market in the process of building a foundation, rather than one that has already entered a euphoric phase. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Measured In another analysis, CryptoQuant\u2019s Enigma Trader examined the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key indicator used to evaluate the extent of realized profits by Bitcoin holders.
