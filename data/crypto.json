      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/why-xrp-stands-to-gain-big-from-ripple-rlusd/",
      "summary": "Ripple\u2019s dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has spent the past six months quietly becoming one of the fastest-growing assets in the $160 billion stable-value sector, even though almost all of its issuance still sits on a rival network, not the XRP Ledger. That dichotomy\u201495 percent of the $455 million supply now lives on Ethereum\u2014was the starting point for a lively weekend exchange on X between XRP pundit \u201cCrypto Eri\u201d and sceptics who questioned whether Ripple\u2019s plans would ever benefit the XRP Ledger (XRPL) itself. XRP\u2019s Hidden Advantage? \u201cRipple is a long-game player,\u201d Eri wrote. \u201cIts public statements to integrate smart contracts on the mainnet will eventually position RLUSD on XRPL as a more competitive stablecoin, with faster and cheaper settlements than Ethereum.\u201d The remark landed just days after Ripple switched on its EVM-compatible sidechain, bringing full Ethereum-style smart-contract functionality to XRPL on 30 June 2025. More than 1,400 contracts were deployed in the first week, according to developer telemetry, and the bridge is already live to 80 other chains through Axelar. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts On-chain data underscore the stakes. RLUSD\u2019s circulating supply rose by 47 percent in June alone to $455 million, the fastest pace among major stablecoins, with roughly $390 million now native to Ethereum after a four-fold expansion since January. Only about $65 million remains on XRPL. That imbalance prompted one user to tell Eri that RLUSD\u2019s utility \u201cimpacts ETH more than XRP.\u201d She conceded the point\u2014\u201ccorrect, for now\u201d\u2014but argued demand would migrate once XRPL\u2019s programmability and liquidity deepen. Ripple\u2019s strategy hinges on more than code. On 2 June the company applied to the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a national trust-bank charter. A parallel filing by its subsidiary, Standard Custody &#38; Trust, seeks a Federal Reserve master account so that RLUSD reserves can eventually sit at the central bank rather than a correspondent institution. The timing aligns with the pending GENIUS Act, bipartisan legislation that for the first time would impose a single federal regime on payment-stablecoin issuers. While the bill\u2019s $10 billion-asset threshold means RLUSD could remain under New York oversight for now, the application positions Ripple to graduate into federal supervision voluntarily\u2014a move CEO Brad Garlinghouse has called a \u201cnew (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.\u201d Eri underscored the charter angle in her post: \u201cThe national banking license application, aligned with the GENIUS Act, secures a Federal Reserve master account \u2026 enhancing trust, expanding crypto financial and payment services, and removing the patchwork of state licenses, enabling continued scalability at lower cost.\u201d Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Breakdown To Next Support Level, Why $2.28 Is Important If the charter is granted and RLUSD begins to migrate on-demand to XRPL, two flywheels favor the native token, analysts say. First, RLUSD remittances on XRPL would pay transaction fees in XRP, turning every dollar of stablecoin volume into incremental demand for the asset Ripple still holds in large quantities. Second, the EVM sidechain lets decentralized-finance builders tap RLUSD liquidity without leaving XRP\u2019s low-cost consensus layer, potentially reversing the flow of users and liquidity that has so far moved toward Ethereum. \u201cThese calculated steps in the $$$$$-dollar stablecoin market give the digital asset XRP enormous potential, but require more time to unfold,\u201d Eri argues. For now, RLUSD\u2019s growth is still driven by Ethereum\u2019s DeFi economy, and sceptics like user \u201csammie\u201d insist \u201cit\u2019s always going to be like this.\u201d Eri\u2019s final reply was succinct: \u201cLet\u2019s see. I know we\u2019ll be touching base often!\u201d That brevity captures both the promise and the uncertainty ahead. Technical rails are in place; regulatory applications are filed. Whether capital, compliance, and market demand will converge quickly enough to shift billions of RLUSD onto XRPL\u2014and in turn lift XRP\u2019s utility\u2014remains the multi-billion-dollar question.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/snaky-way-presale-live-ai-meme-coin-ake-gears-up-for-bull-run/",
      "summary": "If you\u2019ve been around crypto long enough, you know the signs. Bitcoin wakes up. Ethereum starts stretching. Suddenly, the air feels different. Whispers of the next bull run are back. And as always, the early birds are hunting for that next moonshot. While most eyes are glued to the usual suspects, a slithery new player is wriggling into the spotlight \u2013 and no, it\u2019s not another dog coin. Snaky Way ($AKE), a meme coin with actual utility, is now in the presale phase and turning heads. Packed with AI-powered buybacks, multichain access, and a play-to-earn game, Snaky Way is shaping up to be a meme coin with real staying power. The crypto presale is now live, and early buyers are already scooping up $AKE at just $0.0000942. Let&#8217;s dive in \u2013 but watch your step, there might be a snake lurking nearby. What Is Snaky Way ($AKE) and Why Is It Different? Snaky Way ($AKE) is part meme coin, part AI bot, and part arcade. That\u2019s already three more things than most of the best meme coins offer. The token at the center of it all is $AKE \u2013 yes, like \u2018snake\u2019 without the \u2018sn.\u2019 It\u2019s crawling onto seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum, so you can dodge gas fees like a ninja. But here\u2019s the real twist: they\u2019ve embedded an AI agent into the smart contract that automatically buys back tokens when the price starts to dip. Think of it like a tiny, caffeinated trader living in your token. It watches the price 24/7. When panic sellers show up, it steps in and buys the dip \u2013 automatically. That helps smooth out those gut-wrenching price dumps that meme coins are famous for. Oh, and there&#8217;s a snake-themed game coming too. Win matches, earn $AKE, and spend tokens on in-game gear and tournaments. So instead of just hoping the token moons, you\u2019re actually doing something with it. Imagine if Flappy Bird paid your rent \u2013 it\u2019s a bit like that, just less flapping and more slithering. Why Buy $AKE Right Now? Right now, you can snag $AKE for just $0.0000942. That\u2019s couch-cushion money. But we&#8217;ve all seen what happens when a meme coin catches fire. Just ask early $DOGE or $SHIB holders, who are looking at returns of over 30,000% and 800,000%, respectively, since listing. The presale is already gaining momentum with $164K raised and climbing. This isn\u2019t just a hobby project with vibes and a dream. The team\u2019s got a roadmap, audits, and tokenomics that actually make sense. Only 3% of tokens go to the team, and they\u2019re vesting. That\u2019s a far cry from the usual 20%+ cash grabs you see all over new crypto launches. They\u2019re setting aside 30% of the supply for early buyers and using 29% for marketing, which, let\u2019s be real, is the lifeblood of meme coins. Even the best altcoins need eyeballs to grow. The rest goes to liquidity, staking rewards, and community goodies. Speaking of staking, early $AKE holders are seeing annual returns north of 10,000% right now. That number will shrink as more people join, but hey, it\u2019s not every day that your meme coin offers rewards that look like lottery numbers. With strong tokenomics, multichain support, and a game that gives the coin purpose beyond \u2018number go up,\u2019 Snaky Way is sliding into some serious potential. Don\u2019t Sleep on the Snake The Snaky Way ($AKE) presale is live, and the stars are lining up. You\u2019ve got meme appeal, gaming utility, and a smart AI system keeping price dips in check. It\u2019s weirdly serious for a meme coin, and that\u2019s exactly why it might surprise everyone when the market starts heating up again. Meme coins usually come down to hype and timing. Snaky Way brings something new to the table: a reason to stay. And if history repeats itself, the next bull run might just crown a new reptilian king. As always, remember this is not financial advice, and do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto."

      "summary": "Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun has lost a significant chunk of its market share to LetsBonk.fun. This comes just ahead of the former\u2019s token generation event, in which the launchpad could raise up to $4 billion. Solana\u2019s Pump.fun Loses Dominance To LetsBonk.fun In an X post, Solana News revealed that Pump.fun has hit a new all-time low with just a 36% market share, while LetsBonk.fun\u2019s market share has surged to 54%. Jup data also confirms this development. At press time, LetsBonk boasts a market share of 48.90%, with a 24-hour trading volume of $539 million. On the other hand, Pump boasts a market share of 39.80%, with a 24-hour trading volume of $438 million. Related Reading: Analyst Says Buying This Meme Coin Is A 3X Leveraged Play If Solana ETFs Go Live This development comes amid Pump.fun\u2019s proposed public token sale, scheduled for July 12. Well-known Solana influencer Lynk has described this token sale as the \u201cfinal scam\u201d for the meme coin launchpad. The platform has been under heavy criticism for the amount of money that it has extracted from the Solana ecosystem, without incentivizing community members in any way. Some community members had expected Pump.fun to airdrop its token to rewards platform users instead of conducting a public token sale. Lynk shared details of the public sale, with the meme coin launchpad planning to sell the \u2018PUMP\u2019 tokens $0.004 each. The token boasts a total supply of 1 trillion, meaning a fully diluted value (FDV) of $4 billion. However, Pump.fun plans to raise around $600 million from the public token sale, as only $150 billion tokens will be available. The meme coin launchpad is expected to also conduct a private sale in order to complete its $1 billion capital raise effort, as earlier reported. LetsBonk.fun To Keep Dominating Pump.fun In an X post, crypto influencer Unipcs, also known as \u2018Bonk Guy,\u2019 opined that Pump.fun isn\u2019t done, but that LetsBonk.fun will likely continue to be the industry leader. He predicts that this will be the case for the foreseeable future. He outlined several reasons why he believes this would be the case. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs Firstly, he stated that LetsBonk\u2019s pro-creator, pro-people, pro-Solana ecosystem alignment is a massive strength over Pump.fun.

Furthermore, the crypto influencer remarked that Pump.fun had a lot of momentum as a tokenless protocol, especially with a token generation event (TGE). However, LetsBonk.fun was able to flip the platform during this period. As such, Bonk Guy believes that it is hard to see Pump.fun sustainably recover the kind of market share it once had after the TGE event. He also suggested that a \u201cnon-negligible amount of activity on Pump.fun is inorganic with a lot os users farming on the platform, hoping that there was going to be an airdrop. As such, the influencer believes that the traffic will dry up once the TGE is over. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake\u2019s Latest Track\u2014Details According to trading data, its price shot from under $10 to a whopping $80 within hours, pushing its fully diluted valuation to nearly $75 billion. But by July 2025, TRUMP had tumbled back to $8.60, a 90% drop from its peak. Its circulating market cap now sits around $1.70 billion, with a fully diluted value of about $8.60 billion. Cross Chain Push Into Tron Based on reports from the project\u2019s official X account, TRUMP plans its first expansion beyond Solana by launching on the Tron blockchain. This move is designed to tap Tron\u2019s large user base and faster transaction speeds. Tron boasts over 100 million accounts and sub\u2011second confirmations, which the TRUMP team believes could fuel a fresh wave of buyers and traders. $TRUMP on #TRON is coming. Stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/S5WfV8APvU \u2014 TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) July 7, 2025 Volatile Price Swings Define TRUMP TRUMP\u2019s rollercoaster debut underlines extreme volatility. After the initial frenzy in January, the coin\u2019s price plummeted by 88% from $80 to $8.60. That slide erased roughly $65 billion in valuation. Today\u2019s price reflects speculative trading rather than any long\u2011term adoption. Investors who rode the peak saw massive gains briefly, then steep losses just as quickly. Justin Sun\u2019s Big Stake On May 20, 2025, Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted that he is TRUMP\u2019s largest holder. He reportedly owns nearly $19 million worth of tokens after a $75 million investment in Trump\u2019s World Liberty Financial platform. Sun\u2019s position comes with perks. He won a \u201cprivate dinner\u201d alongside the top 220 token holders, securing a seat at US President Donald Trump\u2019s Virginia golf club. Critics say that kind of setup blurs the line between crypto hype and pay\u2011to\u2011play politics. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Central Control Raises Warnings Two Trump\u2011affiliated companies, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, control 80% of TRUMP\u2019s token supply. Those tokens are locked under a three\u2011year vesting schedule. Analysts warn that when insiders hold such large shares, they can sway prices at will. That level of centralization runs counter to crypto\u2019s promise of open and fair systems. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley have called for new rules to curb how politicians and their allies can launch or endorse digital coins. They argue that projects like TRUMP could be used for personal gain or campaign boosts, creating a need for clearer boundaries. Traders And Regulators Brace For Tron Launch As TRUMP eyes a Tron debut, traders and regulators alike will watch closely. The move could spark a fresh surge in trading volume. Yet the same factors that drove its initial spike\u2014viral hype, insider perks, and a heavy token concentration\u2014could just as easily lead to another steep plunge.

      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-next-move-hinges-on-2-35/",
      "summary": "XRP is showing mixed signals across timeframes, leaving traders on edge as the price approaches the key $2.35 level. While a recent breakout from a falling wedge on the 3-day chart suggests a bullish reversal, the 4-hour chart reveals signs of slowing momentum and a possible rising wedge. With buyers and sellers locked in a battle, $2.35 could be the tipping point that decides whether XRP surges higher or slips into a near-term correction. XRP Breaks Out Of Falling Wedge On 3-Day Chart In an X post, LSplayQ highlighted a key technical development on the XRP 3-day price chart, pointing to a breakout from a falling wedge pattern. This type of pattern is commonly associated with bullish reversals, signaling that market sentiment may be shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: XRP Silent Accumulation: A Falling Wedge On The Verge Of Explosion Following the breakout, XRP is currently trading around $2.26, and according to LSplayQ, the move suggests that buyers are stepping back in to reclaim control. The price action marks a significant shift after an extended period of downward compression within the wedge. If the bullish momentum continues, LSplayQ notes that XRP could target a breakout level near $2.72, which represents an upside potential of roughly 20% from the current price. That said, LSplayQ also warns of the risk of a pullback if XRP fails to hold above the wedge breakout level. In such a scenario, the price could retest the $2.10 zone as a potential support. Overall, the technical outlook leans bullish, as long as XRP maintains its position above the breakout level. Rising Wedge Pattern Signals Caution Ahead In a post on X, The Crypto Bushman pointed out that XRP is pushing higher on the 4-hour chart, but warned that seasoned traders are keeping a close eye on what lies beneath the surface. Related Reading: XRP Price Pops and Drops \u2014 Can Bulls Regain Control? According to the analyst, the price is currently trading above both the 20- and 50-day EMAs, which typically signals short-term strength. However, the overall structure appears to be forming a rising wedge, a pattern often linked to potential reversals. At the same time, momentum is beginning to fade, with the MACD flattening and volume tapering off, which Bushman describes as classic signs of a potential trap move. The Crypto Bushman emphasized that a failure to break cleanly above $2.35 could lead to the setup rolling over.

On the flip side, a strong breakout backed by volume could fuel another leg up toward $2.50 if buying pressure returns decisively. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com"
