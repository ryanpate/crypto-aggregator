      "link": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-breaks-records-what-miners-and-leverage-traders-are-doing-behind-the-scenes/",
      "summary": "Bitcoin has surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching $118,254 and marking a notable milestone in its price trajectory. This latest milestone comes after BTC&#8217;s former high at $111,000 levels in May, representing a 10% gain over the past week and roughly 5.9% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $117,584. The sharp price increase appears to be giving strength to activity among both miners and leveraged traders, prompting a closer examination of current market behavior. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have flagged a resurgence of miner activity alongside a rise in derivative positions, suggesting multiple forces may now be contributing to price movements. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY\u2014If Treasury Firms Hold As these two segments of the market engage more actively, questions are emerging around the sustainability of this rally and whether these behaviors signal confidence or caution. The current on-chain environment shows both selling pressure from miners and increased exposure from long-positioned traders. Bitcoin Miner Activity Rises Alongside Price Surge One of CryptoQuant\u2019s QuickTake contributors, Arab Chain, observed a marked increase in miner activity as Bitcoin crossed the $118,000 level. According to the analyst, this uptick in activity is tied to miner transfers to exchanges, marking the first such increase since May 23. This trend suggests miners could be taking advantage of recent price gains to realize profits. As Arab Chain explained, \u201cThe continued activity of miners, coupled with Bitcoin&#8217;s price rising to new highs, clearly indicates that they are selling Bitcoin.\u201d Despite this renewed transfer volume, miner behavior has not yet reached the scale of over-the-counter (OTC) selling seen in previous months. Historically, large-scale selling by miners has introduced notable volatility into the market, particularly when sustained across a broader period. The analyst also pointed out the economic leverage miners hold in decision-making, owing to their ability to manage operational costs and balance between holding and selling mined Bitcoin. Whether this increase in exchange flows will develop into heavier selling remains to be seen. Derivatives Market Shows Renewed Leverage Exposure In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Enigma Trader focused on derivatives market activity, highlighting a 24% surge in open interest from approximately $33 billion on July 1 to over $41 billion by July 11. The timing of this increase coincides with Bitcoin\u2019s breakout above $118,000, and reflects renewed leveraged interest following a reset late last month. This level of open interest suggests that traders are positioning more aggressively, potentially anticipating continued upside. The analyst also noted a shift in funding rates from negative to their highest positive reading in a month, around 0.012% per eight hours. Positive funding indicates that long-positioned traders are paying to maintain their positions, a sign of bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback However, Enigma Trader cautioned that such positioning can become precarious if momentum slows. \u201cThis setup often fuels upside continuation if spot demand backs it, but also increases the risk of a long squeeze should momentum stall,\u201d the analyst wrote.

      "summary": "As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to post new all-time highs (ATH), reaching as much as $118,869 on Binance, market indicators show little sign of overheating. The lack of retail-driven hype amid BTC&#8217;s record-breaking run suggests there may still be room for further growth in the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ATH Sees Absence Of Hype According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, Bitcoin\u2019s current rally is notably characterized by the absence of retail investors. The contributor argues that this lack of retail participation implies BTC may still have significant upside potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The analysis centers on the Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge metric, which tracks the frequency of retail trading activity in the Bitcoin spot market. The analyst shared the following chart to illustrate the trend. When retail trading activity rises significantly compared to the one-year moving average (MA), the chart forms bubbles. Green bubbles indicate that there are very few retail investors currently in the market. Orange bubbles show that trading activity among retail investors is picking up. Similarly, red bubbles indicate caution, hinting that there are too many retail investors in the market and that it may be a good time to consider exit strategies. As the below chart shows, retail activity remains subdued &#8211; even as BTC continues to reach new ATHs. In fact, the metric has stayed within the gray zone since March 2024, reflecting a lack of mass retail entry. Historically, retail trading tends to surge as BTC approaches or exceeds ATH levels. The analyst notes that this absence may indicate the cycle top is still ahead: The bull market is still largely driven by institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When retail finally enters the scene, that might mark the beginning of the final phase. BTC Witnessing Subdued Selling Pressure In addition to the low retail presence, other on-chain indicators suggest that Bitcoin&#8217;s current rally is not overheating. For example, the Miner Position Index has been declining since November 2024, implying reduced selling pressure from miners. Another key metric, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, is holding steady around 2.2 &#8211; below the 2.7 levels observed during ATHs in March and December 2024. Recent analysis predicts the next significant resistance may emerge at around $130,900. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up?

      "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s summer rally accelerated in the early hours of 11 July, when the benchmark cryptocurrency sliced through $118,000 and printed exchange highs that peaked above $118,800, depending on venue data. The spike wiped out an estimated $1.25 billion in short positions within a single trading day, according to CoinGlass figures. Bitcoin Bull Trap Or Breakout? Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards took to X as the breakout unfolded. \u201cNew all-time highs beget new ATHs. It\u2019s usually unwise to ignore a major breakout like this, until invalidated,\u201d he wrote, adding that corporate treasury demand has \u201cgrown exponentially, with dozens of new companies popping up in recent months.\u201d Edwards\u2019 base-case projection calls for a further 50\u201370 percent advance over the next six months\u2014roughly $170,000\u2013$196,000. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY\u2014If Treasury Firms Hold His focus on treasuries is backed by hard data. Public companies added a record 159,107 BTC in Q2\u2014pushing aggregate corporate holdings above 847,000 BTC, or about four percent of max supply. Corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have even outpaced ETF net inflows. Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck, framed Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory within a broader macro and policy backdrop. \u201cThe natural course for Bitcoin remains higher, driven by persistent US debt and deficit problems, demographic tailwinds, a weakening dollar, growing momentum around Fed rate cuts, and the potential for a new Fed chair next year,\u201d he wrote on X. Sigel also highlighted Capitol Hill\u2019s looming \u201cCrypto Week,\u201d where stablecoin legislation is widely viewed as the most passable of several digital-asset bills. Those developments, he argues, make $180,000 \u201cvery much in play for 2025.\u201d Law-makers appear to share the sense of urgency. A press statement from the House Financial Services Committee confirms that the week of 14 July will be dedicated to advancing the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the GENIUS Act. Passage would establish the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and market structure, a change Sigel says could \u201cunlock wide-open capital markets\u201d for the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Spot Bitcoin ETFs are hardly idle: net inflows into BlackRock\u2019s iShares fund alone have pushed its holdings past 700,000 BTC in the 18 months since launch. Yet Edwards and Sigel both note that treasury companies have become the marginal buyer in 2025. The dynamic creates what Edwards calls a \u201ccap-raising flywheel,\u201d as firms showcase outperforming share prices\u2014up nearly 60 percent year-to-date for the treasury cohort\u2014when courting investors. Notably, the rally is unfolding against a supportive macro backdrop. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told a Dallas Fed audience he is \u201copen to cutting the policy rate in July,\u201d arguing current settings are \u201ctoo tight\u201d given waning inflation pressures. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell over the past weeks, demanding immediate rate cuts. Trump\u2019s tariff escalation also seems to fade out, supporting the Bitcoin rally. Notwithstanding euphoric headlines, technicians warn that momentum must sustain above $110,000 to avoid a failed-breakout pattern. \u201cThis theory would be weakened with closes below $110K and invalidated below $105K,\u201d Edwards concludes.

      "summary": "The Ethereum price is once again gaining momentum and looks set to reach new highs. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on how the altcoin has broken through a crucial moving average (MA). Meanwhile, ETH\u2019s dominance is again on the rise. Ethereum Price Breaks 50EMA On Weekly Chart In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that after 9 weeks of constant rejection at the EMA50 on the weekly chart, the Ethereum price has finally broken through. He claimed that it was a very good sign, as it suggests that ETH will reach higher targets in the coming weeks. The break above the 2,600 EMA50 level came as the broader crypto market rallied. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here? This rally has been led by the Bitcoin price, which has reached new all-time highs (ATHs). Based on this, the Ethereum price is expected to also reach new highs, with the yearly high of $3,600 already in sight. A reclaim of this level could also pave the way for ETH to reclaim the psychological $4,000 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital alluded to the rising dominance of the Ethereum price. He noted that this ETH dominance fractal will not be a copy-paste version of what happened between 2019 and 2020. However, the analyst claimed that the recent rise to 10% of the dominance level shows that Ethereum wants to become more market-dominant in the coming months. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also believes that it is time for the Ethereum price to make its move. In an X post, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $10,000 on this upward trend. He made this prediction while highlighting ETH\u2019s chart against its BTC pair, suggesting that he also agrees that Ethereum\u2019s dominance will rise in the coming months. ETH\u2019s Move To Trigger Altcoin Season In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that the Ethereum price is following the Wyckoff re-accumulation schematic. He further remarked that this massive move will trigger altcoin season after ETH reaches the \u201cSOS\u201d level around $3,000. His accompanying chart also showed that he expects Ethereum to reach as high as $3,200 in the short term.

This is bullish for the Ethereum price and other altcoins as they would outperform BTC during this period. It is worth mentioning that Mikybull Crypto has also predicted that ETH can reach $10,000 in this market cycle.
