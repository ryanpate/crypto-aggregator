      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, so the past couple days in crypto have felt like binge-watching a political thriller—except instead of &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt;, it’s Trump and Musk duking it out on X, and our portfolios are caught in the crossfire. Here’s the lowdown:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump vs. Musk: When Billionaire Beef Meets Blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;On June 5, Elon Musk went full keyboard warrior, ripping into Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (seriously, that’s the name) for gutting EV incentives. He even floated impeaching Trump and starting a new centrist party—bold moves for a guy who just left a White House advisory gig. Naturally, Trump retaliated by threatening to yank Musk’s federal contracts (you know, the ones fueling SpaceX and Tesla) and calling Musk “crazy.” Musk then dropped a bombshell, alleging Trump had ties to the Epstein files—again, via X—so you can imagine how civil this got .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Weekly Crypto Vibes: XRP&#39;s Week in the Spotlight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! This week in crypto felt like riding a roller coaster with your eyes closed—thrilling, a bit scary, but mostly fun. Here’s what I noticed from May 28 to June 4, 2025, with a special shout-out to XRP for stealing the show.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XRP’s Unexpected Glow-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I was sipping coffee on May 31 when I saw XRP drop to about $2.08. I nearly spit my coffee out when it shot up to $2.27 by June 4—like, overnight glow-up level. People online were losing their minds (in a good way). Volume was decent, so it wasn’t just bots having fun. If you’re thinking “Woohoo! Let’s buy!” just remember that $2.30–$2.35 is a solid ceiling—so don’t be that person who holds until it drops back down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
