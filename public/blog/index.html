      </h2>
      <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">Jun 13, 2025</p>
      <div class="content is-size-7"><p>Hey crew, it’s my last day soaking up sun on Bald Head Island, so here’s a slightly longer wrap-up before I pack up my beach chair. Over the weekend, the Israel-Iran airstrikes kicked off a wave of risk-off trading—Bitcoin dipped below $103K before clawing back to around $105K by this afternoon as oil and gold spiked (<a href="(https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-sinks-below-103000-as-israel-iran-conflict-sparks-global-crypto-selloff/articleshow/121820959.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com)">Economic Times</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/dollar-other-safe-havens-rise-israel-strikes-iran-2025-06-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Reuters</a>). Ether and XRP weren’t immune either, down roughly 4% and 3.5% respectively at the worst of it. The big red flag? If Iran actually closes the Strait of Hormuz, we could see another cliff dive in crypto—as Cointelegraph warned, that chokepoint handles 20% of global oil, and any shutdown would torch risk assets overnight (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/closing-strait-hormuz-biggest-risk-btc-price-weekend?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Cointelegraph</a>).</p></div>

      <div class="content is-size-7"><p><strong>Midweek Crypto Check-In from Bald Head Island</strong></p>
<p>Hey fam, I’m halfway through my sand-and-sun retreat here at Bald Head Island, NC—sunscreen on, laptop mostly off. But I couldn’t help peeking at the markets, so here’s a quick roundup of how last week’s picks fared and what’s popping now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong><br>
Still cruising near $103k—up about 1% since Friday. Those bank custody rumors turned out less “now or never” and more “slow-and-steady,” so BTC’s just vibing.</p></div>

      </h2>
      <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">Jun 6, 2025</p>
      <div class="content is-size-7"><p>Hey everyone, happy Friday! Crypto’s been doing its usual dance: Bitcoin’s been holding strong around $102k after that overnight pop on news of another major bank announcing they’re dipping their toes into BTC custody services. Ethereum’s chilling in the $2,600–$2,650 range, but I’m keeping an eye on a possible breakout if Sunday’s staking rewards update comes through without hiccups. Meanwhile, XRP’s just hanging out near $2.12, flirting with resistance—if that ETF chat heats up again, it could see a quick spike. Personally, I’m tossing a small buy into Litecoin (LTC) this afternoon since it’s been creeping back toward $160 and feels like a low-key play if overall sentiment stays upbeat. Oh, and I snagged a few dollars’ worth of Dogecoin, mostly for old times’ sake and because Elon teased something cryptic about “meme power” in his morning tweet. Who knows, right?</p></div>

      </h2>
      <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">Jun 5, 2025</p>
      <div class="content is-size-7"><p>Hey, so the past couple days in crypto have felt like binge-watching a political thriller—except instead of <em>House of Cards</em>, it’s Trump and Musk duking it out on X, and our portfolios are caught in the crossfire. Here’s the lowdown:</p>
<p><strong>Trump vs. Musk: When Billionaire Beef Meets Blockchain</strong><br>
On June 5, Elon Musk went full keyboard warrior, ripping into Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (seriously, that’s the name) for gutting EV incentives. He even floated impeaching Trump and starting a new centrist party—bold moves for a guy who just left a White House advisory gig. Naturally, Trump retaliated by threatening to yank Musk’s federal contracts (you know, the ones fueling SpaceX and Tesla) and calling Musk “crazy.” Musk then dropped a bombshell, alleging Trump had ties to the Epstein files—again, via X—so you can imagine how civil this got.</p></div>

        <a href="/blog/06042025/" class="has-text-black" style="text-decoration:none;">Weekly Crypto Vibes: XRP&#39;s Week in the Spotlight</a>
      </h2>
      <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">Jun 4, 2025</p>
      <div class="content is-size-7"><p>Hey there! This week in crypto felt like riding a roller coaster with your eyes closed—thrilling, a bit scary, but mostly fun. Here’s what I noticed from May 28 to June 4, 2025, with a special shout-out to XRP for stealing the show.</p>
<p><strong>XRP’s Unexpected Glow-Up</strong>
I was sipping coffee on May 31 when I saw XRP drop to about $2.08. I nearly spit my coffee out when it shot up to $2.27 by June 4—like, overnight glow-up level. People online were losing their minds (in a good way). Volume was decent, so it wasn’t just bots having fun. If you’re thinking “Woohoo! Let’s buy!” just remember that $2.30–$2.35 is a solid ceiling—so don’t be that person who holds until it drops back down.</p></div>
