                <p class="is-size-7">Ethereum is showing impressive resilience as it continues to hold above critical levels despite ongoing market volatility. While Bitcoin struggles to break past its all-time highs, ETH remains stable, maintaining bullish structure and fueling hopes for a broader altcoin rally. Analysts across the market are eyeing a potential altseason, with Ethereum expected to lead the charge once it clears major supply zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst However, the spotlight is shifting to a less discussed but highly significant chart—ETHBTC. According to top analyst Daan, the ETHBTC pair has been consolidating in a tight range between 0.022 and 0.026 since the last squeeze. This consolidation suggests a period of accumulation and reduced volatility, but it also acts as a crucial signal for altcoin momentum. If ETHBTC breaks above the 0.026 resistance level, Daan suggests it could trigger a temporary but powerful rally in ALT/BTC pairs. Sectors closely tied to Ethereum—such as DeFi protocols, ETH-based memecoins, and Layer 2 ecosystems—could benefit most from such a move. Until then, investors are closely monitoring ETH’s performance relative to BTC, as it remains one of the most reliable indicators of capital rotation within the crypto market. ETHBTC Chart Becomes Key to Altseason Outlook Ethereum is currently trading at a pivotal range, with investors closely watching for a breakout that could lead to new highs and potentially ignite the long-anticipated altseason. Despite global tensions and continued macroeconomic uncertainty—particularly surrounding the aggressive and unstable Bond market—ETH has remained relatively strong. Bulls are optimistic, viewing the current consolidation as a healthy pause before the next leg up. One of the most important signals for altcoin momentum is not found on the USD chart, but in the ETHBTC pair. Daan points out that Ethereum’s price relative to Bitcoin has been consolidating between the 0.022 and 0.026 BTC range since the recent squeeze. This range now acts as a pressure point for the market. A breakout above 0.026 would likely catalyze a surge in altcoin strength, especially among Ethereum-related assets like DeFi protocols, ETH-based memecoins, and Layer 2 solutions. However, Daan warns that if ETHBTC drops below 0.0224, it could signal weakness for alts relative to BTC. It’s important to remember that ALT/BTC pairs can fall even if altcoin USD prices rise, particularly during aggressive BTC rallies. The same applies in reverse. For now, ETH’s position in this range remains one of the most telling signs of where the broader crypto market might head next. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Pivotal Level – Key Resistance Around $2,650 Ethereum Faces Resistance As Bulls Attempt Breakout Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,640, showing signs of strength after holding its ground above the $2,500 mark. On the daily chart, ETH is forming a clear consolidation pattern just below a key resistance zone defined by the 200-day moving average (currently at $2,676). This level has repeatedly capped price action over the past few weeks, signaling strong supply pressure in this area. Despite the lack of a decisive breakout, Ethereum is maintaining a bullish structure with higher lows and consistent volume support. The 34-day EMA has turned upward and currently sits at $2,418, providing dynamic support and reinforcing the short-term uptrend. If ETH can reclaim the 200-day SMA and push above $2,700, a broader rally could follow, potentially opening the path toward $3,000 and beyond. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Key Support After Sweeping Lows – Early Signs Of Reversal? On the downside, if price fails to break this resistance and sellers take control, immediate support lies near $2,500, followed by stronger demand around $2,350–$2,400 where the 50- and 100-day SMAs converge. For now, Ethereum remains in a balanced state, showing resilience, but still needs a strong catalyst to overcome the technical ceiling that continues to stall upward momentum.

                <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-dominance-reverse-at-64/" target="_blank">Certified Analyst Says Bitcoin Dominance Could Reverse At 64% – Is It Time For Altcoin Season?</a>
                
                <p class="is-size-7">Bitcoin&#8217;s current price action is marked by a consolidation around the $105,500 price level. Although it reached an intraday high of $106,807, it has since returned to $105,500, and its dominance also witnessed a minor fall. Notably, Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance metric, the BTC.D, which measures its share of the total crypto market capitalization, has stalled around the 64% level in recent weeks. This stalling behavior drew attention from a certified market analyst, especially in light of many altcoins struggling to gain momentum in an environment dominated by Bitcoin&#8217;s inflow. BTC Dominance Hits Resistance, Candlestick Flash Warnings According to certified Level III CMT analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino, the 64% region on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart could mark a meaningful reversal point. Sharing his insights alongside a technical chart of Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap dominance on the monthly timeframe, Severino pointed out that the latest monthly candlestick formed a Doji right at the bottom of a previous Falling Window. Related Reading: Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance Reaches Critical Level Above 64% In Japanese candlestick theory, such &#8220;windows&#8221; are not just gaps to be filled but serve as critical zones of support or resistance. The fact that BTC.D formed a Doji candle precisely at this window, according to Severino, is a textbook reaction suggesting the dominance rally may be losing strength. This candlestick structure brings the focus onto how the current monthly candlestick plays out. If the current monthly candle becomes an Evening Star candlestick and closes below 62%, the odds of Bitcoin dominance rolling over increase significantly. Altcoin Season Not Quite There Yet As noted by Tony, if Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance candlestick this month forms an Evening Star pattern and closes below 62%, it has a high possibility of marking the end of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s current dominance. However, the analyst added a key caveat: the BTC.D Relative Strength Index (RSI) closed the previous month above 70, still suggesting strong momentum and keeping the larger trend in flux. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says Despite these early signals, Severino warned against jumping the gun. Although the technical evidence points to a possible short-term reversal in dominance, he clarified that it does not necessarily guarantee a full-fledged altcoin season. In his words, &#8220;I am still not of the mindset that we will get a typical altcoin season, but I am seeing some of the first signs that BTC.D might reverse here.&#8221; For now, Bitcoin continues to hold steady above $105,000, and until BTC.D breaks convincingly below 62%, the cryptocurrency is in dominance. Nonetheless, the altcoin market could soon be looking at its first real window of opportunity in months. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,500, down by 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dominance is currently at 63.1%, down by 0.57% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, increased its market share by 2.13% to 9.6%.

                <p class="is-size-7">Solana (SOL) continues to face resistance at the $160 level, failing to reclaim it despite multiple attempts over the past several days. As market momentum weakens and volatility rises, investors are growing cautious. Bitcoin and Ethereum—typically leading indicators—are also showing signs of exhaustion, unable to break past their recent highs. This has triggered concerns that a broader market retrace could follow. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst Still, not all analysts are turning bearish. Prominent trader Kaleo shared a bullish technical outlook, suggesting that Solana remains one of the most promising altcoins if the crypto market regains strength. According to Kaleo, if momentum returns and the market heats up in the coming months, SOL could rally sharply and tag the $300 level—a move that would nearly double its current price. However, such a scenario would likely require broader participation and renewed appetite for risk across digital assets. For now, SOL trades in a tight range, with its short-term outlook hinging on the behavior of Bitcoin and Ethereum. If leading assets stabilize and bulls step back in, Solana could be primed for a breakout. Otherwise, further downside cannot be ruled out as uncertainty weighs on sentiment. Solana Faces Uncertainty But Eyes Explosive Breakout Above Multi-Year Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently struggling to find strong demand as market conditions cool following an intense rally earlier this year. While trading has slowed and bullish momentum appears to be fading, optimism persists among long-term investors. Many expect that once broader market strength returns, SOL could initiate a powerful move into higher supply zones and potentially reach new all-time highs. This cautious optimism comes amid growing global tensions. The ongoing tariff conflict between the United States and China continues to unsettle financial markets, and stress signals in the US bond market are raising alarms about systemic risks. Should these macroeconomic pressures intensify, altcoins like Solana may face renewed headwinds as investors rotate into safer assets. However, despite the current uncertainty, Kaleo maintains a bullish long-term outlook for SOL. According to his analysis, once Solana reaches the $300 level—a key historical resistance—it could break into price discovery. This would mark the end of a multi-year consolidation phase and potentially unleash a parabolic rally. Such a breakout would not only validate the strength of Solana’s fundamentals and ecosystem but also signal broader confidence returning to the altcoin sector. Until then, patience and strategic positioning remain crucial. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Pivotal Level – Key Resistance Around $2,650 Key Support Holding But Momentum Remains Weak Solana (SOL) is trading at $157.46 after bouncing slightly from recent lows around $154, showing modest signs of stability. The price is testing the 34-day EMA near $162, which has acted as a dynamic resistance in recent sessions. SOL remains trapped below its 200-day SMA at $178.88, suggesting the broader trend remains under pressure. A reclaim of that level is crucial for bulls to regain confidence. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong conviction from either side. If SOL manages to push above the $162–$165 range, it could open the door for a retest of the $180 resistance zone. However, failure to break above the 34-day EMA soon may result in another leg down toward the 100-day SMA support near $144. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A 5-Figure Breakout – Volatility Is Shaking ‘Weak Hands’ The chart shows lower highs forming since mid-May, adding pressure to the bullish structure. However, the fact that SOL continues to hold above the $150 zone shows that buyers are still defending key demand. A decisive break and close above $165 on strong volume could confirm a short-term reversal. Until then, SOL remains range-bound with a neutral-to-bearish bias unless momentum accelerates to the upside. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView</p>

                <p class="is-size-7">California embraces its techie heart and opens the door for crypto payments. That’s probably not surprising for the state that hosts Coinbase, Kraken, and other big-name crypto companies. And with obvious support from those organizations, it’s probably even less surprising that the California assembly passed the upcoming crypto payments bill, AB 1180, unanimously, 68-0. The move allows the state government to accept crypto payments – including Bitcoin – for certain obligations. If it passes the state senate, there’d be a trial program from 2026-2031, followed by full adoption. California Cements Spot Among Top World Economies It’s a big deal because California boasts the 4th-largest economy in the world, with $4.1T nominal GDP. That’s right – if it were a country, California would rank just behind the US, China, and Germany, and just ahead of Japan. And – partially fueled by crypto growth in the form of Kraken, Coinbase, et al – California can also point to an economic growth rate that outpaces the other top economies. California’s growing at 6% year-over-year, with an average growth rate of 7.5% from 2021-2024. In other words, this isn’t Colorado ($550B) or Louisiana ($327B), two other states that have similar rules in place. It’s not even Florida ($1.7T), which also is moving to accept crypto. California is one of the largest economies in the world, the largest state economy in the US, and if the bill passes, it’ll take card, cash, and crypto. AB 1180 Payments Bill Supports Upcoming Bitcoin Bill While AB 1180 focuses on the government side, another bill – AB 1052 – does something similar for private payments. Specifically, AB 1052 establishes clearly that crypto payments are acceptable means of settling private debts. It supports a self-custody regulatory structure, while also opening the door for a state digital assets reserve formed of unclaimed assets. Together, AB 1052 and AB 1180 show California&#8217;s going ‘all-in’ on crypto. Another major global economic player bites the dust, bowing before crypto’s relentless rise. Adopting crypto payments for both private and public organizations will require a top-notch, easy-to-learn crypto wallet. That’s where Best Wallet app and the Best Wallet Token come in. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Supercharge Leading Web3 Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers up the already-impressive performance of the Best Wallet app. The app delivers a secure, reliable self-custody Web3 wallet, with biometric security and support for dozens of blockchains.

                <p class="is-size-7">Dogecoin is approaching a decisive inflection point, according to crypto-market commentator VisionPulsed. Throughout his latest analysis he argued that the coming fortnight must deliver an upside resolution—otherwise the meme-coin risks locking in a sequence of red monthly closes that would echo bear-market conditions. Dogecoin On The Brink Of 6-Month Meltdown The analyst anchored his outlook to several recurring signals on Dogecoin’s multi-time-frame charts. “We’re going to get a large move in June. It’s going to happen. The question is, is it up or down?” he began, pointing to the Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) squeezing toward levels that historically precede violent price expansion. In his view, the compression cannot last beyond the next two weekly candles: “BBWP is screaming that we’re about to get something … probably this week; if not this week, then next week.” Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree VisionPulsed balanced that volatility warning against a newly triggered hash-ribbon buy signal—a metric generated when network hashrate recovers after miner capitulation. “We’ve been making the case that in this bull run, when we have gotten the weekly buy signals, the market actually went down and then it went up,” he explained. The fractal, observed twice since 2024, invited cautious optimism that the latest cross could again invert short-term weakness into a rally: “If history is going to repeat itself, we should go down, which we did … and I would make the case that we really should hopefully get a move up in June.” Yet momentum oscillators threaten that scenario. On his two-day chart the stock-RSI has curled lower for the first time since last year. “This may be the first time we print the overbought RSI and don’t go up,” he conceded, warning that a failure to rebound quickly would undermine the hash-ribbon signal and oblige traders “to get tucked in and go to sleep because it’s just always bearish.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Just Hit Its Final Support—Bulls Have One Last Shot Timing is equally unforgiving. VisionPulsed framed Dogecoin’s rallies inside a 70-to-80-day cycle measured from major swing lows; the current window expires in mid-June. “Technically 70 days would be the second week of June, which we’re in that box right now,” he said. “If we don’t actually go up in June, then it is worrisome,” because history suggests that a bearish June would bleed into July and August, while September is “always bearish,” producing what he dryly labels a “one-month bull run.” He added that macro cross-currents raise the stakes. “The S&#38;P 500 is starting to get close to the all-time high,” he noted, suggesting that a decisive move in equities could tip crypto sentiment. At the same time Dogecoin continues to carve incrementally higher lows, a constructive but fragile pattern that now collides with the expiring cycle window: “If we’re actually bullish, we kind of got to go.” For traders the message is binary. A breakout to the upside in the next ten trading days would validate the hash-ribbon cross, keep the rising-lows structure intact, and reset sentiment after what the analyst counts as “six out of seven red months” in the making. Failure, on the other hand, risks cementing a “bearish spiral” that could dominate the rest of the summer and revive memories of genuine bear-market grind. As VisionPulsed put it while signing off: “We’re definitely at an inflection point. The potential energy is building up.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1958.
