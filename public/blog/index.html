                <p class="is-size-7">Solana (SOL) is currently navigating a challenging environment as the broader crypto market experiences a cooldown. After an impressive run earlier this year, momentum has slowed significantly, and SOL is struggling to reclaim the $160 level with conviction. The lack of strong demand has been evident in recent sessions, as buying pressure fades and volume remains low across major altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout Despite this cooling phase, many investors remain optimistic. A growing number of market participants believe Solana could lead the next altseason once conditions stabilize and liquidity returns to the market. Historically, SOL has shown the ability to recover rapidly and outperform in bullish phases, making it one of the top contenders for explosive upside when sentiment shifts. However, in the short term, caution prevails. Top analyst Carl Runefelt has highlighted a key technical development, noting that Solana might be on the verge of breaking a horizontal support zone. This event could trigger further downside in the near term. If this support fails, traders should prepare for increased volatility. Still, the broader consensus remains that SOL’s structural strength and ecosystem development position it well for long-term upside once macro conditions align. Solana Faces Bear Flag Breakdown Risk As Uncertainty Grows Solana has been locked in a tight range just below the $160 mark, struggling to reclaim key levels despite multiple attempts. For several days, momentum has faded, and with global markets under pressure, traders are bracing for increased volatility. The broader crypto market is losing steam as Bitcoin and Ethereum fail to sustain upward moves, which puts added pressure on altcoins like Solana. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, with ongoing tariff disputes and rising bond yields fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. The US bond market, in particular, is flashing signs of stress, adding to the caution in risk-on assets. If these conditions persist, altcoins may face a challenging period as capital retreats to more stable assets like Bitcoin or exits the market altogether. Runefelt recently highlighted a key technical pattern on Solana’s chart—a bear flag forming around horizontal support. According to his analysis, this structure could break down any hour now, which would confirm the bearish setup and potentially send SOL down toward the $142 level. This target aligns with previous support zones and could act as a temporary bottom if the broader market stabilizes. Despite the short-term risks, long-term sentiment around Solana remains cautiously optimistic. The network’s continued development and strong DeFi presence could fuel a recovery once market conditions improve. For now, however, traders are closely watching the $160 resistance and the $150–$152 support area, which could determine the next directional move. A clean break below support would likely trigger a wave of selling, while a reclaim of the $160 level could invalidate the bearish setup and open the door for a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? SOL Tests Key Support As Bearish Momentum Builds Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $152.62 on the 4-hour chart, testing a critical horizontal support zone as bearish momentum continues. The recent price action shows a clear downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows forming since the rejection from the $176–$180 area in late May. All key moving averages—34 EMA, 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA—are positioned above the current price, signaling short-term weakness and a lack of bullish momentum. Volume has picked up slightly as price nears support, suggesting increasing market interest at this level. However, the failure to break above the 34 EMA (currently at $157.70) reinforces the view that sellers are still in control. The flattening 200 SMA at $165.31 and declining 50 SMA around $159.82 indicate that SOL must reclaim the $160–$165 zone to regain strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst If the $150–$152 support range fails to hold, Solana could break down and target the next key support area around $142, in line with the projected move of the bear flag pattern identified by analysts. For now, bulls must defend this level to prevent deeper losses and keep hopes of a recovery alive in the near term. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView</p>

                <p class="is-size-7">What does crypto want to be when it grows up? Centralized exchanges like Coinbase have long marketed themselves as crypto&#8217;s answer to convenience. User-friendly, regulated, and custodial. Just give them the keys and let them drive. They&#8217;ll handle all the boring details – like on/off ramps, UI, integrated swapping, and little things like taking control of your crypto. And in return, all you need to do is trust. But increasingly, that deal sounds like a bad one. The trade-off between trust and control is no longer worth it. Trust Coinbase and other custodial platforms too much, and what do you get? Hacks and data breaches, among other things. There’s a better path forward – and more and more crypto users are looking for it. A Better Custody Deal So, what should the future of crypto be? Crypto should still be easy. It should still be intuitive. But it should also be private, safe, secure, and truly self-custodial. After all, the old adage of ‘not your keys, not your crypto’ shouldn&#8217;t just be a slogan – it is, and should be, the foundation of decentralized finance. That&#8217;s where wallets like Best Wallet come in. Unlike centralized platforms, self-custody crypto wallets like Best Wallet don&#8217;t hold your private keys. You have complete control of your assets at all times. There are no middlemen, no single points of failure, and no need to put your trust in third parties. But what about the convenience of swapping crypto, sending crypto, and exploring new crypto opportunities all from one app? Bridging the Gap: Self-Custody Meets Convenience The future of crypto points to tools that combine the convenience of centralized exchanges like Coinbase, including KYC and AML requirements, with the security of self-custody, without sacrificing usability. We&#8217;ve already seen this with tools like Railgun, which complies with KYC while enabling private transactions on DeFi platforms, and which Vitalik Buterin just used to transfer $2.6M in crypto. While transactions of that size may well be just another day in the office for the Ethereum founder, it demonstrates how increasingly important privacy, control, and functionality are in the developing crypto economy. This is nothing new; it&#8217;s often the people most deeply involved in tech who understand just how important it is to control your own data (and your own crypto). Remember Zuckerberg’s camera? That was the time he was promoting Meta, and everyone realized he&#8217;d taped across his laptop&#8217;s microphone and camera. Was that paranoia or an understanding of just how vulnerable our data is? That&#8217;s the balance that Best Wallet wants to deliver, beating MetaMask at its own game and dominating the Web3 self-custody wallet market. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Self-Custody Crypto Wallet Presale Token Crypto wallets aren’t just handy places to stash some spare Bitcoin, at least not anymore. The best crypto wallets – like Best Wallet – serve as all-in-one control hubs for crypto investors, whether you&#8217;re operating multiple wallets, swapping tokens, ot investing in crypto presales. And that&#8217;s not all. The Best Wallet ecosystem is supercharged by its own token, $BEST. Best Wallet Token holders get: Lower transaction fees Higher staking rewards Earlier presale access Eligibility for bonus crypto airdrops (such as BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrop) Best Wallet and the $BEST token are building the crypto future that Buterin and others are looking for: interconnected, seamless, and self-custodial. It&#8217;s everything you could want or ever need from a crypto wallet. You can manage your portfolio, browse upcoming token launches (including the best new meme coins), and spend your crypto in real life with the upcoming Best Card. Buying, selling, and swapping are as easy as tapping a few buttons. And all this is secured with multi-party computation (MPC) and biometric authentication to keep your crypto safe without sacrificing ease of use. The Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $13.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.025135. That could rise to $0.035215 by the end of the year, according to our $BEST price prediction, delivering gains of 40% to current presale investors. Learn more about how to buy Best Wallet Token with our guide. Best Wallet: Building the Self-Custodial Future of Crypto No longer does crypto have to choose between usability and control. Tools like Best Wallet are showing that self-custody platforms can match – or even beat – the convenience that centralized exchanges offer while staying true to the core values of crypto. As more self-custodial models appear in a post-Coinbase world, Best Wallet wants to lead the charge and dominate this $11B sector. If it succeeds, it will be by delivering a product that is convenient and completely crypto-native. Always do your own research before investing in crypto; this isn’t financial advice. Crypto self-custody is the future. Best Wallet is helping to build that future.</p>

                <p class="is-size-7">The Bitcoin price is falling fast, and with bears currently taking control, a crypto analyst has forecasted an impending crash below $100,000. While this potential downturn may sound alarming, the analyst has also revealed that after the pullback, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to undergo a significant price rally to new all-time highs. Bitcoin Price Faces Immediate Crash Risk Bitcoin appears to be entering a cooling phase after experiencing a significant bullish run that spanned several weeks and led to its current all-time high of almost $112,000. ‘MelikaTrader94’, the TradingView crypto analyst responsible for this new technical analysis, predicts that during this cooling period, bears could take over and send the Bitcoin price crashing down to former lows under $100,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings On a 4-hour chart presented by the analyst, Bitcoin has consistently respected a descending trendline acting as a strong resistance threshold. This line, which formed after the recent peak, has now rejected price action multiple times, preventing further upward movement and hinting at growing bearish pressure in the short term. At the time of the analysis, Bitcoin was trading at $106,432, attempting to test the descending trendline once again. However, the chart shows that BTC lacks strong momentum, suggesting that another rejection is likely. If this rejection occurs, BTC’s price action is expected to correct downward toward the $99,000 region, marked on the chart as a key horizontal support zone. Bitcoin’s projected pullback is consistent with typical market behavior, especially after an extended bullish phase. Based on the TradingView expert’s analysis, a drop to the $99,000 support level could shake out weak hands and provide fresh buy-dip opportunities for traders. While the structure of the projected downward move is not entirely bearish, it suggests a necessary retest of lower support areas before any sustainable rally can resume. Bullish Continuation Expected After Pullback MelikaTrader94 has suggested that correcting down to the $99,000 support zone is critical for determining Bitcoin’s next rally. If this crash successfully occurs and buyers step in to defend the support, BTC could begin forming a strong bullish continuation structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch The TradingView analyst’s chart outlines a possible rebound from the support area, which could trigger a breakout above the descending trendline. A sustained move above this trendline would potentially invalidate the short-term bearish structure and set the stage for a new all-time high, with price targets extending beyond $114,000. Notably, Bitcoin’s consolidation around its current price of $104,500, followed by a possible dip to the well-established support zone, fits the analyst’s narrative that the market is preparing for a big move. The TradingView expert has urged investors and traders to keep an eye out for a strong bounce, as this projected pullback could be a healthy one that comes just before a bullish leg up.

                <p class="is-size-7">Ethereum is trading at critical levels after breaking past the $2,500 mark earlier this quarter, now attempting to reclaim momentum and push into higher resistance. Despite global macroeconomic pressures—including rising US Treasury yields and persistent trade tensions between the US and China—ETH continues to show resilience. Market analysts believe that Ethereum could be leading the charge into a long-anticipated altseason, provided it holds key levels and breaks above current supply. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? Top analyst Ted Pillows recently pointed to a compelling technical pattern: Ethereum has now posted four consecutive two-week green candles, a formation that mirrors Bitcoin’s price structure in early 2020 following the March crash. That period marked the beginning of Bitcoin’s legendary bull run to $69,000. According to Pillows, the similarities between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025 are “just mind blowing,” sparking renewed interest from traders who see Ethereum’s current consolidation as a bullish continuation. With investor sentiment slowly recovering and technicals turning favorable, the market is watching ETH closely. If history is any guide, this consolidation could mark the calm before Ethereum’s next major leg higher. However, macro risks still linger, and timing will be critical. Ethereum Resilience Sparks Hopes Of 2020-Like Rally Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,600 level, showing resilience amid global macro uncertainty and volatile market conditions. This consolidation around key support has many investors and analysts anticipating a breakout that could lead Ethereum into a new rally phase, potentially triggering a broader altseason. Despite growing concerns around systemic risk in the bond market and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, Ethereum continues to attract buyers, signaling confidence in its long-term strength. Analysts are watching this range closely. Many believe that if Ethereum can maintain support and break above near-term resistance, it could gain serious momentum. One of the more compelling arguments for a bullish outlook comes from Ted Pillows, who highlights a striking similarity between Ethereum’s current structure and Bitcoin’s behavior in 2020. According to Pillows, Ethereum has now printed four consecutive two-week green candles since bottoming, just as Bitcoin did after the March 2020 crash. That pattern marked the start of BTC’s legendary run to $69,000. The comparison has sparked optimism that ETH may be preparing for a similar breakout, especially if it clears resistance near $2,700–$2,800. While the macro environment remains tense, this technical structure—paired with rising confidence in ETH’s strength—keeps bulls hopeful that a major move is on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Consolidation Above Support Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,607, consolidating just above the 34-period EMA on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near $2,594. After the strong surge in early May that saw ETH rally from under $2,000 to highs near $2,850, the price has moved into a tight consolidation range. This sideways action reflects market indecision as buyers and sellers battle for control. Despite the recent volatility, ETH has continued to post higher lows, indicating ongoing bullish pressure. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are aligned below the current price, all trending upward, signaling that the broader trend remains intact. The price is finding consistent support from the 50-period SMA around the $2,590–$2,600 zone, which is a key level to watch.

On the downside, a break below $2,590 could trigger a pullback toward $2,500 or lower, especially if BTC shows weakness. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView</p>

                <p class="is-size-7">Dogecoin’s six-month slide may be about to reach its moment of truth, according to independent market commentator VisionPulsed, who told followers on June 4 that the memecoin must vault the long-standing ceiling at roughly $0.40 “either this week or next” if the broader bullish structure is to survive the summer. In a video analysis, the analyst pointed to a second consecutive “blue bar” flashing on Ethereum’s momentum oscillator, a signal he treats as a reliable harbinger of imminent, high-magnitude moves across the digital-asset complex. “The last time we had two blue bars on Ethereum was way back when we were still young and optimistic,” he said, invoking memories of August 2023. “We printed five that time and the market moved sixteen percent. We’re at two now; by Sunday we’ll probably have four, which tells me the move should come next week.” Dogecoin Needs June Rally To Avert Summer Slump Although the blue-bar framework is native to Ethereum, VisionPulsed argued that its read-through for Bitcoin and, by correlation, Dogecoin is more important than ever. He noted that Bitcoin’s own hash-ribbon metric—formed when the network’s 30-day and 60-day hash-rate moving averages compress—has followed a strictly “sell for two weeks, then rally” pattern through the current cycle. “We’ve already been selling off for two weeks,” he said. “Historically in this bull market, that’s when Bitcoin resets and moves higher. If that plays out again, Dogecoin should finally get the lift it’s been denied since February.” Related Reading: June Or Doom: Dogecoin Faces 6 Red Months If It Fails To Surge, Predicts Analyst The crux of his thesis sits on a 70-day timing model derived from Dogecoin’s prior impulse lows. Measuring from the most recent trough, the 70-day mark falls on 14 June. “Every major upswing in Dogecoin during this cycle has come 60 to 80 days after a bottom,” he explained, scrolling through historical candles on screen. “We’re right on that window—if we’re going to break higher, it almost has to be now.” VisionPulsed acknowledged his own track record of slipping deadlines—“one for five hundred,” he joked—but insisted the structure remains statistically sound. “If we don’t rally next week, I’m never putting dates on anything again,” he told viewers, before adding a caveat that has become the headline takeaway. “Dogecoin has to clear $0.40. If we can’t do that, the bear case strengthens dramatically: June down, July probably down, September seasonally weak, and suddenly you’re talking eight red months out of nine.” Pressed by commenters about the depth of a potential downside scenario, the analyst pointed to Ethereum for context. A bullish resolution, he said, could lift ETH to roughly $3,200 before a summer consolidation and possibly $4,200 by early autumn, a path that in his view would drag Dogecoin well north of the $0.40 trigger. Failure, however, “sets up a very large move down, maybe sub-$2,000 on ETH,” a slide that would likely leave Dogecoin retesting multi-month lows. “Whichever way we go,” he concluded, “is going to determine the rest of the summer.” Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The urgency is aggravated by Dogecoin’s mounting sequence of monthly losses: five red candles since January, with only a brief reprieve in April. “Six red months out of seven is staring us in the face,” VisionPulsed said. “June doesn’t have to be a vertical move, but it does have to be green—or at least show a decisive breakout—because otherwise, where is the bull run?” Market structure rather than sentiment, he stressed, underpins the call. Bitcoin already sits near cycle highs while Dogecoin still trades markedly below its own year-to-date peak, a divergence he interprets as latent leverage. “If Bitcoin punches through its local top, it typically drags Doge,” he said, referencing earlier intervals in 2024 when BTC strength eventually translated into delayed but exaggerated moves in the memecoin. Whether that historical choreography can repeat depends, in his framework, on the next few daily closes. “We’re definitely getting more energy built up,” he said, pointing to narrowing Bollinger Bands and declining on-chain activity. “I don’t think the large move is here yet, but by late this week—or early next week at the latest—you should get your answer.” For traders who still believe the four-year cycle remains intact, the analyst’s $0.40 line in the sand arrives almost exactly one calendar year before the next projected Bitcoin top in October 2026. “If Doge can’t start moving now, the entire timing model gets pushed off course,” he warned. “I genuinely think June is a make-or-break month.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.
