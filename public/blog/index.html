                <p class="is-size-7">Dogecoin’s daily time-frame has reached a critical point that leaves virtually no margin for error. Price settled last night at $0.17551, clinging to a slender cushion just above the confluence of two of the chart’s most important guide rails: the former down-trend resistance that runs from late February and the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2024’s late advance to $0.48440. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone The structural landscape is defined by a six-month descending channel that has corralled every impulse since Dogecoin topped at $0.48440 on 8 December. The median of that channel—slicing through the field at roughly $0.1800—functioned as durable support until Thursday, when an 11% slide in sympathy with Bitcoin split it cleanly. A failure-retest of a channel mid-line is seldom trivial; until DOGE can reclaim $0.1800 on a closing basis, the chart message remains one of trend continuity. Beneath the market, the black trendline that first rejected rallies on 26 March, 26 April and 2 May reclaimed centre-stage after price vaulted it on 8 May, ran to the channel ceiling at $0.2540, and was twice rebuffed—the first rejection on 11 May, the second on 23 May. The trendline is now retested as support where it intersects the 0.786 Fib at $0.16700, producing a high-stakes cross-point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst If that level fractures, the only historical scaffolding is the multi-year ascending trendline (drawn from May 2021’s all-time high) that merges with a proven demand band spanning $0.14500 to $0.13500. That rectangle arrested the early-April shake-out and would represent the bulls’ final trench; surrendering it would invalidate the long-term series of higher lows and almost certainly inaugurate a broader bear phase with potential gravitational pull back to the January pivot at $0.12990. Oscillators and overlays do little to contradict the bearish drift. The fourteen-day Relative Strength Index sits at 34.70, hovering just above oversold territory but still tracking below its own moving average at 45.22, underscoring persistent negative momentum. Price Targets Overhead, resistance layers are stacked like dominoes. Immediate priority for the bulls is a daily close back above the channel midline at $0.1800; failing that, any attempt at recovery is suspect. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The next ceiling is the compressing exponential moving average cluster: the 20-day EMA at $0.20120, the 50-day at $0.20091, the 100-day at $0.20677 and the 200-day at $0.21550. With all four averages declining and bunched inside a three-cent band, they act as a single reinforced lid near the psychological $0.20 handle. Clearing that barricade would deliver price to the channel’s upper rail, now descending through $0.22. A weekly close outside that boundary would finally neutralise the half-year downtrend and force shorts to cover into the next Fibonacci checkpoints derived from the November high: the 61.8 percent retracement at $0.23484, the 50 percent at $0.28249, the 38.2 percent at $0.33014 and the 23.6 percent at $0.38910. Until then, however, the blunt arithmetic favours the bears. A floor at $0.16700 backed by a multi-touch trendline is slim protection when sentiment is fragile and macro flows are unhelpful. If that shelf cracks, the market’s inertia points toward $0.14500–$0.13500, Dogecoin’s last defensible plateau. Should that red demand zone capitulate, the technical map turns blank down to the January base at $0.12990 and, beyond that into deep bearish territory, especially the August 2024 low at $0.08.

                <p class="is-size-7">Ethereum has so far underperformed in this market cycle but looks ready to mount a parabolic rally based on analysts&#8217; predictions. Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a bullish pattern on ETH’s chart, which provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin. Ethereum Eyes $3,300 As Morningstar Candle Pattern Forms In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that Ethereum could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern forms for the largest altcoin by market cap. This came as he highlighted the bullish monthly close for ETH and alluded to the monthly chart printing this bullish pattern. With this, the analyst expects a significant rally from Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH Crypto Bullet noted that Ethereum is now facing tough resistance, but he believes that the $2,500 resistance will be broken. The analyst added that his next target is $3,300. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ash Crypto also provided a bullish analysis for ETH, in which he declared that the Wyckoff accumulation was still in play. He remarked that the first major level to reclaim is $3,100, which will be followed by a small correction. Following that, Ash Crypto is confident that ETH will then surge to $4,000, which will initiate an explosive rally. The analyst affirmed that $10,000 is programmed for ETH in this cycle. As reported, crypto analyst Crypto GEM recently predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,000 by next year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also highlighted $5,000, $7,000, and $8,500 as the targets for ETH’s market structure. Meanwhile, just like Ash Crypto, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is also confident that the altcoin can reach as high as $10,000 in this market cycle. He highlighted a similarity between Ethereum’s current price action and that of the 2017 market cycle. Ongoing V-Shape Recovery For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted an ongoing V-shape recovery for Ethereum. He noted that ETH has kicked off a sharp reversal, forming a classic V-shape structure on the weekly chart. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $7,600 on this run-up. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Dumps XRP Holdings For Ethereum, Explains Why Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that Ethereum is flirting with a breakout. The analyst further noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already breaking out. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $3,600 on this breakout. He also declared that the fifth time of ETH’s move to the MA20 will be a thrust through. The altcoin is expected to break the $2,600 resistance on this move. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,450, down almost 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

                <p class="is-size-7">Tim Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has doubled down on his call for Bitcoin to hit $250,000 by the end of 2025. He shared this on X, renewing a prediction he first made in 2018 when he set his sights on reaching that mark by 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Back then, the crypto market took a sharp downturn in 2022—thanks in part to FTX’s collapse—and the timeline slipped. Still, Draper believes today’s drivers are strong enough to push prices higher. He even suggested that the US dollar might vanish in a decade as Bitcoin takes its place. Tim Draper’s Bold Timeline According to Draper, the $250,000 target isn’t just wishful thinking. In 2018, he said Bitcoin would reach that level by 2022. It didn’t happen—2022 saw many digital assets tumble in value. This year, though, he repeated his forecast after seeing a “recent surge” in the crypto. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: → General optimism… pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 He also claimed Bitcoin could become “infinite against the dollar,” arguing that in 10 years the US dollar wouldn’t exist. His confident tone suggests he’s sticking with the same numbers—$250,000 by December 31, 2025. Political And Regulatory Drivers Based on reports, Draper points to politics as a big catalyst. He highlighted moves by US President Donald Trump, who is working on new trade deals. One sign of this push is the Media &#38; Technology Group’s filing on June 5, 2025, for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. That application is headed to the NYSE Arca, with Crypto.com lined up as custodian, and it aims to bring more mainstream money into Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, the US Senate voted 66–32 on May 19 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would set rules for stablecoins. Plus, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 is under debate. It has bipartisan support and is meant to spell out clear rules for crypto. Financial Institutions And Adoption Draper also sees banks and big companies stepping in. He mentioned that JP Morgan plans to let its clients buy Bitcoin and use spot-BTC ETFs—like BlackRock’s IBIT—as collateral. That shift could open doors to a flood of institutional cash. Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads the pack, holding over 580,000 BTC. At current prices, that stash is worth about $61 billion. These moves, Draper argues, point to people treating Bitcoin more like gold than a risky token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Technological Advances On Bitcoin In his view, the tech upgrades on Bitcoin matter too. He talked about Web3 apps built on Bitcoin and said “Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum.” Right now, Lightning Network handles many Bitcoin transactions, making payments faster and cheaper.

                <p class="is-size-7">The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a significant decline on Thursday, falling over 7% and approaching the $2,400 mark. However, expert analysis suggests that a new bullish trend may soon emerge for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Key Metrics Indicate Accumulation By Larger Investors Market analyst Lark Davis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum&#8217;s potential. He noted that various on-chain metrics and market behaviors indicate an impending breakout for the ETH price. Notably, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter of the year, suggesting growing investor confidence. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved Ethereum’s scalability and reduced its inflation rate, making it more attractive to investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over Additionally, the expert highlights that with exchange balances hitting seven-year lows and substantial inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it appears that larger investors are accumulating ETH for the long term. Despite these bullish indicators, Davis cautioned that not all market participants share this optimistic outlook. Betting markets on Polymarket currently assign only a 27% chance that Ethereum will reach a new all-time high by 2025. Critical Support For Ethereum Amid Political Disputes The broader cryptocurrency market also faced challenges on Thursday, with total market capitalization dropping from $3.30 trillion to approximately $3.12 trillion. Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana (SOL) were among the notable cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, retracing by 3%, 5%, and 6%, respectively. In a separate but related development, tensions between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk have surfaced, adding to the day’s market volatility. Trump expressed disappointment over Musk&#8217;s criticism of a key tax and spending bill from his administration, suggesting that their &#8220;great relationship&#8221; may be nearing its end. Musk retaliated by accusing Trump of ingratitude, claiming his support was instrumental in Trump’s election victory. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 This public dispute has drawn attention to the intersection of US politics and cryptocurrency, a dynamic that market analyst Income Sharks noted in a recent post on Elon Musk’s social media site, X. The analyst remarked on the swift impact of political conflicts on crypto markets, emphasizing that the Ethereum price has not yet lost critical support levels. Income Sharks, in his analysis, identified the $2,390 mark as a crucial support point for the altcoin in the immediate term, which could determine the next upward targets of $3,000 and $4,000. While trading at $2,406 when writing, Ethereum finds itself well below its all-time high reached during the market’s last bullish cycle in 2021. As of now, the altcoin stands 50% below its record of $4,878, according to CoinGecko data. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com</p>

                <p class="is-size-7">Bitcoin’s majestic 2024-25 ascent may have stalled at the very moment many traders expected an early-summer melt-up, according to crypto analyst Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX). In an extended thread published today, the Ichimoku-focused technician argues that the market printed a “valid cycle high” on the weekly chart and has now slipped into neutral territory—potentially postponing the next decisive breakout until mid-July or, failing that, as late as the first quarter of 2026. Bitcoin Bottom Not In? “I warned multiple times that we can’t be bullish on the weekly before the 9th of June,” Dr Cat reminded followers. The Chiko Span (CS) “entered the candles” last week, he noted, stripping the weekly timeframe of its bullish bias even though the long-term monthly structure remains intact. “Because the monthly chart is bullish, things are still long-term bullish,” he conceded, yet the immediate path higher has narrowed to two clear windows. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History’s Turning The first window opens in the week beginning 16 June. If Bitcoin starts that week above $99,881 and closes with CS breaking cleanly above the candle range, Dr Cat believes “the moonshot, potentially to $270,000,” could ignite. Should price open below that threshold, a textbook CS tracing pattern would already be underway, pushing the next breakout target to the week commencing 14 July (or the one immediately after). “Simply because these are the places where CS can make a clear breakout above the candles terminating a CS tracing,” he explained. Below $93,200—the current position of the weekly Kijun Sen—the bullish countdown is voided. “If the Kijun Sen at 93.2K is lost, we consider much later breakout,” Dr Cat warned, pointing traders to a broad monthly window between November 2025 and April 2026 when the Kijun Sen itself is expected to slope upward again. Until then, he is “not confident that the bottom is in,” flagging $97–98 K as a short-term confluence zone in which the daily Kumo cloud, the weekly Tenkan Sen and the two-day Kijun Sen intersect. The analysis comes at a delicate moment for sentiment. Bitcoin’s April all-time high above $111,999 has so far resisted several retests, and funding rates on major derivatives venues have eased from euphoric to merely positive. For Dr Cat, such moderation is consistent with Ichimoku’s Kihon Suchi 17-period rhythm: “Time cycles … give a valid cycle high on the weekly. I think at this point it obviously printed,” he wrote, implying that a fresh consolidation phase is statistically favored. Altcoin Season Even Further Delayed Altcoins face an even steeper uphill battle. In a companion post dissecting the TOTAL3 index (the market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum), Dr Cat argued that “altcoins are not ready to pump on the weekly and need minimum 1-2 months for that in the most bullish scenario.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 He cited four overlapping bearish ingredients: price below the weekly Kijun Sen, a negative Tenkan–Kijun cross, a Chiko Span trapped beneath the candle “forest,” and a Kijun Sen poised to turn down next week. “The chance for a bullish altcoins explosion in June is around 5 %,” he concluded, assigning a roughly equal probability that Bitcoin alone could rally while “dominance destroys alts.” That dour appraisal extends to Ethereum and other large caps. In Dr Cat’s view, “blindness … applies to anyone expecting a parabolic bull run above ATH in June for TOTAL3.” The first legitimate “window of opportunity for altcoin bulls,” he adds, does not open until August, when the weekly CS will encounter a thinner overhang of historic candles. Market implications hinge on whether Bitcoin can defend its higher-timeframe pivots long enough to align with those temporal windows. So far, the $93.200 Kijun Sen serves as the demarcation line between an orderly pause and a deeper retracement. A weekly close beneath it would “activate” the November-to-April contingency track—effectively pushing any move toward Dr Cat’s headline $270,000 projection into the next halving cycle. At press time, BTC traded at $103,072. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com</p>
