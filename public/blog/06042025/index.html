    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Hey there! This week in crypto felt like riding a roller coaster with your eyes closed—thrilling, a bit scary, but mostly fun. Here’s what I noticed from May 28 to June 4, 2025, with a special shout-out to XRP for stealing the show.</p>
<p>XRP’s Unexpected Glow-Up
I was sipping coffee on May 31 when I saw XRP drop to about $2.08. I nearly spit my coffee out when it shot up to $2.27 by June 4—like, overnight glow-up level. People online were losing their minds (in a good way). Volume was decent, so it wasn’t just bots having fun. If you’re thinking “Woohoo! Let’s buy!” just remember that $2.30–$2.35 is a solid ceiling—so don’t be that person who holds until it drops back down.</p>
<p>Regulatory Tea and ETF Chatter
The SEC officially started looking at an XRP ETF proposal on May 28, which is basically crypto’s version of “Is this thing real or nah?” Rumor has it there might be a Ripple-SEC settlement by June 13. If true, XRP could party even harder. But remember: “rumor” is crypto-speak for “take a large grain of salt.” Keep your stop-loss in check, or you’ll be crying into your ramen noodles.</p>
<p>Whale Moves and On-Chain Gossip
On May 30, Whale Alert flagged that someone moved 10 million XRP (about $22 million) to a mystery wallet. My brain screamed, “Pump incoming!” or “Dump?!” No one knows. Big transfers can mean various things—maybe someone’s hodling, maybe they’re about to sell to buy a yacht. Watching wallet activity is like reading tea leaves—fun, but you’ll still spill coffee sometimes.</p>
<p>XRPL DeFi Vibes
Something called XpFinance had a presale on May 28 and sold about 30% of its tokens. It’s like being invited to an exclusive party—early bird style. If XRPL DeFi is new to you, it’s like DeFi’s cool younger cousin who’s not trying to be Ethereum. Take it slow though—new projects have bugs, and bugs in crypto = $$$ disappearing.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum Chill Mode
BTC spent the week flirting with $105,000. No huge drama, just Bitcoin doing whatever Bitcoin does. ETH hovered around $2,600–$2,650. If Bitcoin breaks $108k, altcoins could get a FOMO boost. If not, we might see some sideways snoozing—nothing wrong with a little nap.</p>
<p>Other Altcoin Hype
Solana and Cardano got a mild pat on the back as BTC held up, but they definitely didn’t steal XRP’s thunder. Some articles say SOL and ADA might pop if BTC stays strong. Meanwhile, people are over here waiting for that sweet XRP ETF approval.</p>
<p>My Two Satoshis
If you’re thinking about hopping on the XRP train, maybe dip a toe around $2.10–$2.15 and don’t get greedy past $2.30. Crypto is basically digital confetti—amazing to look at, irritating when it gets stuck in your hair. Stay nimble, keep an eye on news (and memes), and don’t bet your rent money.</p>
<p>What’s Next?
Big dates to watch: the SEC’s 240-day clock for that ETF kicked off May 28, so any news drop could be a party—or a meltdown. Rumor season around mid-June could be wild, so buckle up.</p>
<p>That’s my take. Crypto’s a wild ride, and XRP was definitely the roller coaster highlight this week. See you next week—hopefully with fewer heart palpitations and more price pumps!</p>
