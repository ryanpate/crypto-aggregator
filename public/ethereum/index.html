                <p class="is-size-7">The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) continues to exert pressure on the broader crypto market, casting a shadow on the prospects of an incoming altcoin season. Despite recent volatility and decline in the market, a crypto analyst observes that Bitcoin Dominance remains firmly elevated, signaling that capital is still concentrated in the leading cryptocurrency. This trend, they argue, is preventing any meaningful breakout for altcoins and could persist unless a decisive shift in market structure occurs. Altcoin Season Stifled As Bitcoin Dominance Surges The Bitcoin Dominance in the cryptocurrency market is tightening its grip, crushing hopes of an imminent altcoin season. According to a recent technical analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter) by market expert Tony Severino, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance has reached 65.72% with both monthly and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings pushing above the critical 70 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Above 66% – How This 4-Year ATH Affects Altcoin Season At the time of the analysis, the RSI on the monthly timeline stood at 73.19, while the weekly registered at 70.58—both firmly in overbought territory. These levels typically reflect strong momentum and extended bullish conditions, indicating that Bitcoin’s command over the crypto market is still strong and growing. Severino shared a dual chart view of Bitcoin Dominance and RSI across the weekly and monthly time frames, highlighting candlestick structures that support Bitcoin’s ongoing upward momentum. BTC.D has been climbing since late 2023. The RSI values also remain comfortably above their respective Moving Average (MA) baselines of 67.31 and 65.42, indicating sustained strength rather than signs of immediate exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin Dominance holds these elevated RSI levels across their major time frames, Severino suggests that altcoins will likely continue to underperform, further delaying the long-awaited altcoin season. The analyst emphasizes that meaningful upside for altcoins will not begin until BTC.D starts to wane and RSI readings fall below 70—effectively signaling a shift in sentiment and market strength that could allow capital to rotate to alternative cryptocurrencies. Until such a pullback occurs, the analyst argues that the weekly and monthly BTC.D and RSI charts strongly indicate that any expectations of an altcoin season this cycle remain premature. Dragonfly Doji Forms On BTC.D Chart In another X post, Severino announced that the Bitcoin Dominance has potentially formed a Dragonfly Doji on the weekly chart. With four days left in the weekly session, the analyst notes that the distinct candle pattern is still developing but presently resembles the classic Dragonfly Doji, characterized by a long lower wick and a close near the opening price. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here’s Why Typically, this chart pattern is viewed as a bullish reversal signal when it appears at the bottom of a downtrend, indicating possible upside momentum. However, in this case, it has emerged during a broader uptrend in BTC.D, creating a more complicated technical picture. Severino believes that the Dragonfly Doji could either represent a continuation of the current momentum or a temporary pause in market direction. If the candle evolves into a larger bullish body and closes above the 65.65% level, it may confirm further strengthening of Bitcoin’s growing market dominance relative to altcoins.

                <p class="is-size-7">Bitcoin held steady Friday as traders braced for a potential shake-up at the Federal Reserve. United States President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a move that could shift the central bank’s approach to interest rates and market liquidity. The Dow Jones climbed more than 300 points midweek, and the ripple reached the crypto market too—Bitcoin nudged higher to around 106,950 before easing slightly. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Markets are reading this as a signal. If Powell is pushed out in favor of someone more open to cutting rates, risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could benefit. The US dollar slipped to a three-year low, and bond yields retreated, adding to the sense that easier money may be coming. For crypto investors, this is a setup worth watching. The #USD fell to a three-year low on intensifying speculation that President Trump could soon nominate a new Fed Chair to replace Powell after his term ends next May, a development that could render him a lame duck writes @johnjhardy in today&#8217;s #forex update.… — Ole S Hansen (@Ole_S_Hansen) June 26, 2025 Trump Moves Toward Possible Fed Overhaul Reports from multiple outlets say Trump is seriously considering replacing Powell before his term ends in 2026. Though no official announcement has been made, sources suggest Trump has discussed potential successors with advisors. His criticism of Powell’s policies isn’t new, but the recent rise in inflation concerns and election-year pressure may be accelerating the timeline. The market response was immediate. Traders began to price in a more dovish Fed policy, which generally means lower interest rates and increased liquidity. That would be good news for crypto, which has languished under tighter monetary conditions throughout the last year. Bitcoin, which is often used as a hedge against fiat debasement, likes to rally when the dollar declines and rates come down. Bitcoin Price Reacts With Caution Bitcoin was trading at 106,950 Friday, with a daily high of 107,250 and a low of 106,145. It wasn’t a breakout, but it was a clear sign of rising interest. Ethereum and other top coins saw similar quiet moves upward. Traders are treading carefully, knowing that talk of replacing the Fed chair is one thing, but actually doing it is another. Stocks Lead The Way, Crypto Follows The bullish mood started with equities. The Dow surged more than 300 points, while the S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq also closed higher. Tech stocks led the rally, pushed by falling Treasury yields and hopes that rate hikes are off the table for now. That optimism spilled into crypto markets, where risk sentiment plays a big role.

Powell is in office, and no formal replacement has been named. But the fact that President Trump is entertaining the idea is already moving markets.

                <p class="is-size-7">Bitwise Asset Management has quietly nudged Dogecoin one step closer to Wall Street’s ETF club, filing an amended S-1 on 26 June that for the first time allows “in-kind” creations and redemptions. The tweak is more than procedural. It lines the proposed Bitwise Dogecoin ETF up with the operational playbook the US Securities and Exchange Commission already blessed for spot-bitcoin and spot-ether products, and it signals that SEC staff are now deep in the weeds on the mechanics of custody and settlement. Signs Point To Dogecoin ETF Approval “Bitwise has filed amended S-1s for their spot Dogecoin ETF and their spot Aptos ETFs. Good signs as it indicates SEC engagement, and tracks with other spot approvals,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X. He underscored the importance of the new language: “One HUGE update to the filing is ‘in-kind’ creations and redemptions… Near-lock at this point that in-kind will be allowed in spot ETFs across board.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal—But One Move Could Ruin It The change matters because in-kind processing lets authorized participants swap DOGE directly for ETF shares (and vice versa) without the tax friction and slippage that accompany the cash-only model imposed on futures-based crypto funds. The SEC’s willingness to consider that structure for a dog-branded altcoin would have seemed fanciful a year ago. It now appears consistent with the regulator’s post-bitcoin-ETF détente, during which issuers also sought in-kind redemptions. Approval odds are converging on the high end of the spectrum. Less than a week ago, Balchunas and fellow analyst James Seyffart raised their probability for “the vast majority” of pending altcoin ETFs—including Dogecoin—to “90 percent or higher,” citing what Seyffart called “very positive” SEC engagement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target Notably, that optimism has not fully washed into prediction markets: on Polymarket, the contract titled “Doge ETF approved in 2025?” was trading around 69% early Friday morning in Europe, while a shorter-dated line for approval by 31 July priced in barely 13% odds. Dogecoin Price Stalls (For Now) Dogecoin itself has yet to reflect the regulatory tail-wind. The token changed hands near $0.161—down roughly 2% on the day. Technical trader Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) argues that bulls still control the longer-term picture: on his weekly chart, DOGE has respected a momentum breakout line traced back to late-2022 on five separate tests, each time spring-boarding into “major bounces.” He pegs the “line in the sand” at the $0.143–0.127 support band: “ Yet Kevin cautions that meme-coin exuberance ultimately hinges on the Federal Reserve, not tweet-driven hype. In a separate post this week, he noted that fresh highs in bitcoin dominance continue to ride “restrictive monetary policy and an uncertain geopolitical environment.” Alt-season, he wrote, will require the end of quantitative tightening and a tangible decline in the US terminal rate—conditions absent since late-2023 and still distant according to Fed-funds futures. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.16123. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com</p>

                <p class="is-size-7">Bitcoin traders everywhere will be watching their feeds closely, willing the world’s largest crypto to hold steady at or near its current $107K mark. $15B in Bitcoin options expire today, a major portion of the roughly $40B in options outstanding. If $BTC’s price falls to $102K or below, the market would endure a true ‘pain point.’ As long as that doesn’t happen, Bitcoin looks set to press on with business as normal – setting the stage for further growth of the ecosystem and the first meme coin offering direct $BTC exposure, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Narrowing Volatility Indicates Positive Outlook The $BTC volatility index has narrowed in recent days, drawing more closely to the historical volatility and generally indicating that traders don’t expect dramatic price moves either way – up or down. That was supported by Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David Péquignot, who stated: ‘Low open interest in perps and fairly depressed Bitcoin implied volatility and skew are indicative of limited expectations for sharp price movements…’ Where does that leave Bitcoin? Still looking bullish. Crypto treasury strategies are still expanding, adding thousands of $BTC tokens to long-term reserves and increasing demand. Metaplanet just added 1,234 $BTC, bringing its total portfolio north of 12K $BTC. And it isn’t just direct Bitcoin purchases; the ecosystem around the world’s leading crypto continues to fuel demand. ETFs Notch 13 Days Consecutive Inflows, Bitcoin Overtakes Google Bitcoin ETFs are building on a 13-day stretch of positive inflows. Monday to Thursday, daily cumulative inflows amounted to: $350M $588M $547M $226M Positive inflows point to long-term interest from retail and institutional investors, rather than short-term traders, and contribute to underlying buying pressure. And with the largest Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, holding over $70B in total assets, Bitcoin took advantage of weakening Alphabet stock to overthrow Google as the world’s sixth-largest asset. It’s a combination of fundamentally positive factors, reinforcing a bullish case for $BTC – and the meme coin built on that case. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Meme Coin Trusting $BTC to Hit $250K and Beyond BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is confident that Bitcoin will one day reach $250K and more – so confident that the project is built around key Bitcoin price milestones. Bitcoin $125K: The project burns $BTCBULL tokens to exert deflationary pressure on the price.

Only three days remain in the presale, so act now – you can learn how to buy BTC Bull token in our guide. Tokens currently cost $0.00258, but our analysts expect the price to hit $0.0084 by year-end.

BTC Options Expire, But Outlook Is Bullish for Bitcoin With $15B in Bitcoin options expiring, narrowing volatility, and consistent ETF inflows, Bitcoin’s foundation looks stronger than ever. For investors looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum, BTC Bull Token offers a bold, milestone-based roadmap aligned with $BTC’s rise to $250K. But be warned – there’s mere days left in the presale, so the window to join is closing fast. Always do your own research. This is not financial advice.</p>

                <p class="is-size-7">According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, more than 14 million Bitcoin have sat idle in wallets with little to no spending history. That leaves only about 7 million BTC out of the total 21 million supply ready for trading. This shift points to a growing number of holders who prefer long-term storage over quick trades. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Steep Rise In Illiquid Bitcoin Based on reports, the illiquid supply of Bitcoin climbed from just under 14 million in December 2024—when Bitcoin first broke the $100K mark—to roughly 14.30 million today. Demand for cold storage and self-custody solutions has never been higher. Investors are moving coins off exchanges and into private wallets. That trend has been especially sharp since late March, even though price swings have stayed volatile. Bitcoin&#8217;s illiquid supply just crossed 14 million $BTC More and more holders are pulling coins off exchanges choosing cold storage over quick trades. The message is clear: conviction is growing, and they’re here for the long haul. #Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoHODL pic.twitter.com/bQozg31mBK — Erica Hazel (@Erica__Hazel) June 26, 2025 Corporate Buyers Ramp Up Holdings In just the past week, more than five companies announced new Bitcoin purchases. ProCap BTC led the way with two buys: 3,724 BTC for $387 million and 1,208 BTC for $128 million, adding up to 4,930 BTC worth $515 million. Michael Saylor’s Strategy added 245 BTC after spending $1 billion the week before. Smarter Web picked up 197 BTC, while Méliuz S.A. acquired 275 BTC, taking its total to 596 BTC. The Blockchain Group chipped in with 75 BTC, bringing its haul to 1,728 BTC. Most recently, Metaplanet spent around $132 million on 1,234 BTC, lifting its total Bitcoin stash to 12,345 BTC purchased for about $1.20 billion. Supply Numbers Tighten Only one-third of Bitcoin’s fixed supply remains “liquid,” meaning it’s likely to trade hands. That squeeze could make it harder for new buyers to find inventory. Over-the-counter desks and exchange order books report thinner BTC listings. When institutions can’t source coins as easily, they may bid prices higher. On-chain metrics can’t tell us why coins are unmoved—some may be lost forever—but the uptick in self-custody transfers shows real demand. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears Forecasts Suggest Price Pressure Ahead At Bitcoin Conference 2025, Eric Trump predicted that he believes BTC will hit $170K at the end of 2026. He pointed out that the number of firms with Bitcoin has doubled in the last year. But if a supply crunch is matched with steady or increasing demand, prices might experience a strong push higher. Yet markets may remain unpredictable. Unexpected sell-offs or macro shocks can turn the trend around quicker than anyone can imagine. Investors and analysts will be monitoring the pace of new entrants into the market. For the time being, a record 14.35 million Bitcoin are sleeping idle, and that constricted supply may lay the groundwork for the next great rally.
