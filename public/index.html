                      <p class="is-size-7">California embraces its techie heart and opens the door for crypto payments. That’s probably not surprising for the state that hosts Coinbase, Kraken, and other big-name crypto companies. And with obvious support from those organizations, it’s probably even less surprising that the California assembly passed the upcoming crypto payments bill, AB 1180, unanimously, 68-0. The move allows the state government to accept crypto payments – including Bitcoin – for certain obligations. If it passes the state senate, there’d be a trial program from 2026-2031, followed by full adoption. California Cements Spot Among Top World Economies It’s a big deal because California boasts the 4th-largest economy in the world, with $4.1T nominal GDP. That’s right – if it were a country, California would rank just behind the US, China, and Germany, and just ahead of Japan. And – partially fueled by crypto growth in the form of Kraken, Coinbase, et al – California can also point to an economic growth rate that outpaces the other top economies. California’s growing at 6% year-over-year, with an average growth rate of 7.5% from 2021-2024. In other words, this isn’t Colorado ($550B) or Louisiana ($327B), two other states that have similar rules in place. It’s not even Florida ($1.7T), which also is moving to accept crypto. California is one of the largest economies in the world, the largest state economy in the US, and if the bill passes, it’ll take card, cash, and crypto. AB 1180 Payments Bill Supports Upcoming Bitcoin Bill While AB 1180 focuses on the government side, another bill – AB 1052 – does something similar for private payments. Specifically, AB 1052 establishes clearly that crypto payments are acceptable means of settling private debts. It supports a self-custody regulatory structure, while also opening the door for a state digital assets reserve formed of unclaimed assets. Together, AB 1052 and AB 1180 show California&#8217;s going ‘all-in’ on crypto. Another major global economic player bites the dust, bowing before crypto’s relentless rise. Adopting crypto payments for both private and public organizations will require a top-notch, easy-to-learn crypto wallet. That’s where Best Wallet app and the Best Wallet Token come in. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Supercharge Leading Web3 Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers up the already-impressive performance of the Best Wallet app. The app delivers a secure, reliable self-custody Web3 wallet, with biometric security and support for dozens of blockchains. It’s also the first crypto wallet dedicated to crypto presales, with an Upcoming Tokens section that breaks down key projects and gives investors the opportunity to purchase hot new tokens before they launch. The $BEST token takes utility up a notch, lowering fees for transactions, giving exclusive presale access, and boosting rewards. It’s a unique wallet with a powerful utility token, and that’s part of the reason our price prediction shows that $BEST could rise 28% from its current price of $0.025125, reaching $0.035215 by the end of the year. To avoid missing out, learn how to buy $BEST with our guide.

Put another way, BTC Bull does what it says on the tin – gives investors a chance to bet big on a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. With California’s mega-economy moving to adopt crypto, and over 100 businesses that already accept Bitcoin payments in California, a bullish Bitcoin bet has perfect timing. What&#8217;s unique about BTC Bull Token is that has no less than four ways to earn: Presale $BTCBULL staking, the long play Regular $BTCBULL price increase post-launch, since a lot of people will be trading it $BTC airdrop for token holders in Best Wallet app $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K With $BTC airdrops at $150K and $200K, and a mega $BTCBULL airdrop at the end of the project when Bitcoin reaches $250K, there are ample rewards for early investors. And in between, $BTCBULL token burns exert deflationary pressure at $BTC $125K, $175K, and $225K. The combination of token burns and airdrops keeps $BTCBULL tied to Bitcoin’s steady progress, and is one of the reasons our BTC Bull price prediction shows the token potentially reaching $0.0084, up 230% from its current price of $0.00254.

                      <p class="is-size-7">Dogecoin is approaching a decisive inflection point, according to crypto-market commentator VisionPulsed. Throughout his latest analysis he argued that the coming fortnight must deliver an upside resolution—otherwise the meme-coin risks locking in a sequence of red monthly closes that would echo bear-market conditions. Dogecoin On The Brink Of 6-Month Meltdown The analyst anchored his outlook to several recurring signals on Dogecoin’s multi-time-frame charts. “We’re going to get a large move in June. It’s going to happen. The question is, is it up or down?” he began, pointing to the Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) squeezing toward levels that historically precede violent price expansion. In his view, the compression cannot last beyond the next two weekly candles: “BBWP is screaming that we’re about to get something … probably this week; if not this week, then next week.” Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree VisionPulsed balanced that volatility warning against a newly triggered hash-ribbon buy signal—a metric generated when network hashrate recovers after miner capitulation. “We’ve been making the case that in this bull run, when we have gotten the weekly buy signals, the market actually went down and then it went up,” he explained. The fractal, observed twice since 2024, invited cautious optimism that the latest cross could again invert short-term weakness into a rally: “If history is going to repeat itself, we should go down, which we did … and I would make the case that we really should hopefully get a move up in June.” Yet momentum oscillators threaten that scenario. On his two-day chart the stock-RSI has curled lower for the first time since last year. “This may be the first time we print the overbought RSI and don’t go up,” he conceded, warning that a failure to rebound quickly would undermine the hash-ribbon signal and oblige traders “to get tucked in and go to sleep because it’s just always bearish.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Just Hit Its Final Support—Bulls Have One Last Shot Timing is equally unforgiving. VisionPulsed framed Dogecoin’s rallies inside a 70-to-80-day cycle measured from major swing lows; the current window expires in mid-June. “Technically 70 days would be the second week of June, which we’re in that box right now,” he said. “If we don’t actually go up in June, then it is worrisome,” because history suggests that a bearish June would bleed into July and August, while September is “always bearish,” producing what he dryly labels a “one-month bull run.” He added that macro cross-currents raise the stakes. “The S&#38;P 500 is starting to get close to the all-time high,” he noted, suggesting that a decisive move in equities could tip crypto sentiment. At the same time Dogecoin continues to carve incrementally higher lows, a constructive but fragile pattern that now collides with the expiring cycle window: “If we’re actually bullish, we kind of got to go.” For traders the message is binary. A breakout to the upside in the next ten trading days would validate the hash-ribbon cross, keep the rising-lows structure intact, and reset sentiment after what the analyst counts as “six out of seven red months” in the making. Failure, on the other hand, risks cementing a “bearish spiral” that could dominate the rest of the summer and revive memories of genuine bear-market grind. As VisionPulsed put it while signing off: “We’re definitely at an inflection point. The potential energy is building up.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1958.

                      <p class="is-size-7">The Bitcoin price is still ping-ponging between support and resistance, but is still moving in favor of the bulls at this point. This is due to the fact that the price is still holding well above $100,000, and this is a psychological level that could be a determinant of a bull or bear move. Amid this, crypto analyst Xanrox believes that the Bitcoin price is headed down after hitting its new all-time high close to $112,000, and this downtrend would push altcoins down further. Why The Bitcoin Price Is Breaking Down The reason for the Bitcoin price decline, as outlined by the crypto analyst, is that the leading cryptocurrency is actually breaking down out of an ascending parallel channel that was formed while the price moved from $74,000 to $112,000. This was seen in the initial downtrend that sent Bitcoin from $111,000 down to $103,000, before the relief rally.

This is also important to keep an eye on since symmetrical triangles are known for sweeping liquidity. While these liquidity sweeps are not one-sided, it is still notable as it can sweep liquidity above and below the triangle. Probabilities of the direction of the liquidity sweep increase in a direction depending on whether the bears or bulls are currently dominating. Xanrox also explains that the Bitcoin price has already completed the five full waves of the Elliot Wave theory, and as such, the next thing is a corrective ABC wave. In this case, it is expected to fall back to the 0.382, 0.500, and 0.618 Fibonacci levels again. Where To Start Buying With the expectation that the Fibonacci levels will fall to 0.382, then 0.500, and then 0.618, the first culprit for where the Bitcoin price is expected to fall to is just below $98,000. At this level, the crypto analyst believes that it is time to start buying. In addition to the chart formations, Xanrox also calls out an unfilled Fair Value Gap (FV) at this level, and once it fills, it is a great level to start buying before the next wave to the upside.

This would put them at great buy levels as well, especially as altcoins are sitting so close to all-time low levels. However, after the first FVG is filled and there isn’t strong momentum, the second Fibonacci level at 0.500 puts the Bitcoin price at $92,000. Meanwhile, the third and last Fibonacaill level at 0.618 puts it as low as $87,500. “Usually we want to look for a buying opportunity at the 0.382, 0.500, or 0.618 FIB levels,” the crypto analyst explained.

                      <p class="is-size-7">Magic Eden, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, has announced a partnership with the team behind President Donald Trump’s memecoin to create an official “TRUMP-branded cryptocurrency wallet.” This new product, aptly named the TRUMP Wallet, will not only feature Trump’s likeness and name but will also support trading of the TRUMP token alongside other digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). TRUMP Wallet Opens Waitlist Amid Controversy The waitlist for the TRUMP Wallet opened on Tuesday at TrumpWallet.com, with a broader launch expected later this summer, as confirmed by a spokesperson from Magic Eden. In a promotional push, the project is being marketed as &#8220;the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans,&#8221; enticing users with the opportunity to share in $1 million worth of the memecoin rewards. Those who sign up and refer friends will be able to enhance their position on the waitlist.

He took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to assert, “I run @Trump and I know nothing about this project!” In a follow up social media post, Eric further said: This project is not authorized by @Trump. @MagicEden I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization. KYC Details Still Unclear The announcement was shared by the official TrumpMeme account, but further details about the partnership, including terms of revenue-sharing and potential Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for users, remain unclear. This initiative is part of a larger strategy to boost engagement in Trump-related cryptocurrency ventures, which have been gaining momentum in recent months. The Presidential family’s expanding crypto portfolio already encompasses a variety of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens, a stablecoin, a decentralized finance platform with its own virtual token, and memecoins named after both Donald Trump and the First Lady.

This Research Chief Thinks So Magic Eden’s CEO recently attended a fundraiser dinner hosted by Trump for previous winners of a TRUMP coin contest, further solidifying the ties between the two entities. It appears that the TRUMP Wallet will be built on the Slingshot Finance platform, a self-custodial trading application acquired by Magic Eden in April. Slingshot is known for featuring various meme tokens, such as Bonk Inu (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and does not directly collect user identity information; instead, this is managed by MoonPay, the app&#8217;s fiat on-ramp provider. When writing, the official memecoin launched by the President’s team trades at $11, recording losses of 12% and 21% on the seven and fourteen days time frame respectively.

                      <p class="is-size-7">As the Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes 5% below its all-time high of $111,800, which was reached last week, predictions of further price declines have emerged. More surprisingly, one expert claims that all of BTC’s history is a &#8220;staged illusion,&#8221; which could cause it to dip toward the $10,000 mark for the first time in nearly five years. Expert Alleges Bitcoin&#8217;s Rise As &#8216;Largest Bubble In History’ Jacob King, the CEO of the news aggregator Whale Whire, took to social media to assert that Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory is a carefully constructed illusion, designed to convey a sense of institutional commitment and government endorsement, thereby fostering the illusion of a thriving market driven by authentic demand. King&#8217;s bold claim characterized Bitcoin&#8217;s current state as the “largest bubble in human history,” poised to unfold as a monumental financial scandal. Of course, this is only King’s opinion based on his analysis. Related Reading: XRP Sell-Off Rumors Swirl After Expert Questions Ripple’s War Chest The narrative King presented delves into the web of interconnected entities that allegedly manipulate the cryptocurrency market. Drawing attention to the case of El Salvador&#8217;s purported Bitcoin investment, King highlighted discrepancies in the narrative, alleging that a significant portion of the country&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves had not been acquired through legitimate means but rather transferred from Bitfinex and Tether. This alleged manipulation, according to King, extends to the very core of the industry, with entities like Tether orchestrating alleged schemes to bolster liquidity and fabricate a façade of institutional backing. Alleged Bitcoin Market Manipulations The unraveling of these alleged machinations, as per King&#8217;s assertions, casts doubt on the authenticity of Bitcoin&#8217;s growth and the legitimacy of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. King&#8217;s narrative underscores a network of “intertwined interests,” where figures like Michael Saylor, founder of the Bitcoin proxy firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), are depicted as integral players perpetuating a cycle of “leverage and speculation” rather than genuine investment in BTC. Furthermore, King&#8217;s reflections extend to the role of stablecoins like Tether’s USDT in propping up the Bitcoin market, creating a “fragile ecosystem” wherein the value of stablecoins could potentially surpass that of traditional fiat currencies. Related Reading: Stablecoins Ignite Record-Breaking May, Supply Jumps To $244B – Data The intricate interplay between Tether&#8217;s activities and Bitcoin&#8217;s stability, according to King, forms a precarious foundation susceptible to collapse in the face of regulatory scrutiny and diminishing institutional interest. All around, King issued a stark warning about a potential nosedive in Bitcoin&#8217;s value, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might plunge towards the $10,000 threshold for the first time in almost half a decade. Expressing skepticism regarding the sustainability of Bitcoin&#8217;s current price levels, King portrayed a market on the verge of a substantial correction. If this ominous forecast materializes, it would signify a profound shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation, departing from the lofty peaks it has recently scaled. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $105,788, recording a 3% retrace in the weekly time frame. Still, Bitcoin holds to gains of over 52% in the year-to-date period.
