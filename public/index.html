                      <p class="is-size-7">Bitcoin&#8217;s current price action is marked by a consolidation around the $105,500 price level. Although it reached an intraday high of $106,807, it has since returned to $105,500, and its dominance also witnessed a minor fall. Notably, Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance metric, the BTC.D, which measures its share of the total crypto market capitalization, has stalled around the 64% level in recent weeks. This stalling behavior drew attention from a certified market analyst, especially in light of many altcoins struggling to gain momentum in an environment dominated by Bitcoin&#8217;s inflow. BTC Dominance Hits Resistance, Candlestick Flash Warnings According to certified Level III CMT analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino, the 64% region on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart could mark a meaningful reversal point. Sharing his insights alongside a technical chart of Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap dominance on the monthly timeframe, Severino pointed out that the latest monthly candlestick formed a Doji right at the bottom of a previous Falling Window. Related Reading: Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance Reaches Critical Level Above 64% In Japanese candlestick theory, such &#8220;windows&#8221; are not just gaps to be filled but serve as critical zones of support or resistance. The fact that BTC.D formed a Doji candle precisely at this window, according to Severino, is a textbook reaction suggesting the dominance rally may be losing strength. This candlestick structure brings the focus onto how the current monthly candlestick plays out. If the current monthly candle becomes an Evening Star candlestick and closes below 62%, the odds of Bitcoin dominance rolling over increase significantly. Altcoin Season Not Quite There Yet As noted by Tony, if Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance candlestick this month forms an Evening Star pattern and closes below 62%, it has a high possibility of marking the end of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s current dominance. However, the analyst added a key caveat: the BTC.D Relative Strength Index (RSI) closed the previous month above 70, still suggesting strong momentum and keeping the larger trend in flux. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says Despite these early signals, Severino warned against jumping the gun. Although the technical evidence points to a possible short-term reversal in dominance, he clarified that it does not necessarily guarantee a full-fledged altcoin season. In his words, &#8220;I am still not of the mindset that we will get a typical altcoin season, but I am seeing some of the first signs that BTC.D might reverse here.&#8221; For now, Bitcoin continues to hold steady above $105,000, and until BTC.D breaks convincingly below 62%, the cryptocurrency is in dominance. Nonetheless, the altcoin market could soon be looking at its first real window of opportunity in months. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,500, down by 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dominance is currently at 63.1%, down by 0.57% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, increased its market share by 2.13% to 9.6%.

                      <p class="is-size-7">Solana (SOL) continues to face resistance at the $160 level, failing to reclaim it despite multiple attempts over the past several days. As market momentum weakens and volatility rises, investors are growing cautious. Bitcoin and Ethereum—typically leading indicators—are also showing signs of exhaustion, unable to break past their recent highs. This has triggered concerns that a broader market retrace could follow. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst Still, not all analysts are turning bearish. Prominent trader Kaleo shared a bullish technical outlook, suggesting that Solana remains one of the most promising altcoins if the crypto market regains strength. According to Kaleo, if momentum returns and the market heats up in the coming months, SOL could rally sharply and tag the $300 level—a move that would nearly double its current price. However, such a scenario would likely require broader participation and renewed appetite for risk across digital assets. For now, SOL trades in a tight range, with its short-term outlook hinging on the behavior of Bitcoin and Ethereum. If leading assets stabilize and bulls step back in, Solana could be primed for a breakout. Otherwise, further downside cannot be ruled out as uncertainty weighs on sentiment. Solana Faces Uncertainty But Eyes Explosive Breakout Above Multi-Year Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently struggling to find strong demand as market conditions cool following an intense rally earlier this year. While trading has slowed and bullish momentum appears to be fading, optimism persists among long-term investors. Many expect that once broader market strength returns, SOL could initiate a powerful move into higher supply zones and potentially reach new all-time highs. This cautious optimism comes amid growing global tensions. The ongoing tariff conflict between the United States and China continues to unsettle financial markets, and stress signals in the US bond market are raising alarms about systemic risks. Should these macroeconomic pressures intensify, altcoins like Solana may face renewed headwinds as investors rotate into safer assets. However, despite the current uncertainty, Kaleo maintains a bullish long-term outlook for SOL. According to his analysis, once Solana reaches the $300 level—a key historical resistance—it could break into price discovery. This would mark the end of a multi-year consolidation phase and potentially unleash a parabolic rally. Such a breakout would not only validate the strength of Solana’s fundamentals and ecosystem but also signal broader confidence returning to the altcoin sector. Until then, patience and strategic positioning remain crucial. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Pivotal Level – Key Resistance Around $2,650 Key Support Holding But Momentum Remains Weak Solana (SOL) is trading at $157.46 after bouncing slightly from recent lows around $154, showing modest signs of stability. The price is testing the 34-day EMA near $162, which has acted as a dynamic resistance in recent sessions. SOL remains trapped below its 200-day SMA at $178.88, suggesting the broader trend remains under pressure. A reclaim of that level is crucial for bulls to regain confidence. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong conviction from either side. If SOL manages to push above the $162–$165 range, it could open the door for a retest of the $180 resistance zone. However, failure to break above the 34-day EMA soon may result in another leg down toward the 100-day SMA support near $144. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A 5-Figure Breakout – Volatility Is Shaking ‘Weak Hands’ The chart shows lower highs forming since mid-May, adding pressure to the bullish structure. However, the fact that SOL continues to hold above the $150 zone shows that buyers are still defending key demand. A decisive break and close above $165 on strong volume could confirm a short-term reversal. Until then, SOL remains range-bound with a neutral-to-bearish bias unless momentum accelerates to the upside. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView</p>

The move allows the state government to accept crypto payments – including Bitcoin – for certain obligations. If it passes the state senate, there’d be a trial program from 2026-2031, followed by full adoption. California Cements Spot Among Top World Economies It’s a big deal because California boasts the 4th-largest economy in the world, with $4.1T nominal GDP. That’s right – if it were a country, California would rank just behind the US, China, and Germany, and just ahead of Japan. And – partially fueled by crypto growth in the form of Kraken, Coinbase, et al – California can also point to an economic growth rate that outpaces the other top economies. California’s growing at 6% year-over-year, with an average growth rate of 7.5% from 2021-2024. In other words, this isn’t Colorado ($550B) or Louisiana ($327B), two other states that have similar rules in place. It’s not even Florida ($1.7T), which also is moving to accept crypto. California is one of the largest economies in the world, the largest state economy in the US, and if the bill passes, it’ll take card, cash, and crypto. AB 1180 Payments Bill Supports Upcoming Bitcoin Bill While AB 1180 focuses on the government side, another bill – AB 1052 – does something similar for private payments. Specifically, AB 1052 establishes clearly that crypto payments are acceptable means of settling private debts. It supports a self-custody regulatory structure, while also opening the door for a state digital assets reserve formed of unclaimed assets. Together, AB 1052 and AB 1180 show California&#8217;s going ‘all-in’ on crypto. Another major global economic player bites the dust, bowing before crypto’s relentless rise.

                      <p class="is-size-7">Dogecoin is approaching a decisive inflection point, according to crypto-market commentator VisionPulsed. Throughout his latest analysis he argued that the coming fortnight must deliver an upside resolution—otherwise the meme-coin risks locking in a sequence of red monthly closes that would echo bear-market conditions. Dogecoin On The Brink Of 6-Month Meltdown The analyst anchored his outlook to several recurring signals on Dogecoin’s multi-time-frame charts. “We’re going to get a large move in June. It’s going to happen. The question is, is it up or down?” he began, pointing to the Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) squeezing toward levels that historically precede violent price expansion. In his view, the compression cannot last beyond the next two weekly candles: “BBWP is screaming that we’re about to get something … probably this week; if not this week, then next week.” Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree VisionPulsed balanced that volatility warning against a newly triggered hash-ribbon buy signal—a metric generated when network hashrate recovers after miner capitulation. “We’ve been making the case that in this bull run, when we have gotten the weekly buy signals, the market actually went down and then it went up,” he explained. The fractal, observed twice since 2024, invited cautious optimism that the latest cross could again invert short-term weakness into a rally: “If history is going to repeat itself, we should go down, which we did … and I would make the case that we really should hopefully get a move up in June.” Yet momentum oscillators threaten that scenario. On his two-day chart the stock-RSI has curled lower for the first time since last year. “This may be the first time we print the overbought RSI and don’t go up,” he conceded, warning that a failure to rebound quickly would undermine the hash-ribbon signal and oblige traders “to get tucked in and go to sleep because it’s just always bearish.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Just Hit Its Final Support—Bulls Have One Last Shot Timing is equally unforgiving. VisionPulsed framed Dogecoin’s rallies inside a 70-to-80-day cycle measured from major swing lows; the current window expires in mid-June. “Technically 70 days would be the second week of June, which we’re in that box right now,” he said. “If we don’t actually go up in June, then it is worrisome,” because history suggests that a bearish June would bleed into July and August, while September is “always bearish,” producing what he dryly labels a “one-month bull run.” He added that macro cross-currents raise the stakes. “The S&#38;P 500 is starting to get close to the all-time high,” he noted, suggesting that a decisive move in equities could tip crypto sentiment. At the same time Dogecoin continues to carve incrementally higher lows, a constructive but fragile pattern that now collides with the expiring cycle window: “If we’re actually bullish, we kind of got to go.” For traders the message is binary. A breakout to the upside in the next ten trading days would validate the hash-ribbon cross, keep the rising-lows structure intact, and reset sentiment after what the analyst counts as “six out of seven red months” in the making. Failure, on the other hand, risks cementing a “bearish spiral” that could dominate the rest of the summer and revive memories of genuine bear-market grind. As VisionPulsed put it while signing off: “We’re definitely at an inflection point. The potential energy is building up.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1958.

                      <p class="is-size-7">The Bitcoin price is still ping-ponging between support and resistance, but is still moving in favor of the bulls at this point. This is due to the fact that the price is still holding well above $100,000, and this is a psychological level that could be a determinant of a bull or bear move. Amid this, crypto analyst Xanrox believes that the Bitcoin price is headed down after hitting its new all-time high close to $112,000, and this downtrend would push altcoins down further. Why The Bitcoin Price Is Breaking Down The reason for the Bitcoin price decline, as outlined by the crypto analyst, is that the leading cryptocurrency is actually breaking down out of an ascending parallel channel that was formed while the price moved from $74,000 to $112,000. This was seen in the initial downtrend that sent Bitcoin from $111,000 down to $103,000, before the relief rally. Related Reading: Wave Count Analysis Reveals The XRP Price Trigger Point For Take-Off In addition to the ascending channel, the crypto analyst also points out the formation of a symmetrical triangle inside the channel. This is also important to keep an eye on since symmetrical triangles are known for sweeping liquidity. While these liquidity sweeps are not one-sided, it is still notable as it can sweep liquidity above and below the triangle. Probabilities of the direction of the liquidity sweep increase in a direction depending on whether the bears or bulls are currently dominating. Xanrox also explains that the Bitcoin price has already completed the five full waves of the Elliot Wave theory, and as such, the next thing is a corrective ABC wave. In this case, it is expected to fall back to the 0.382, 0.500, and 0.618 Fibonacci levels again. Where To Start Buying With the expectation that the Fibonacci levels will fall to 0.382, then 0.500, and then 0.618, the first culprit for where the Bitcoin price is expected to fall to is just below $98,000. At this level, the crypto analyst believes that it is time to start buying. In addition to the chart formations, Xanrox also calls out an unfilled Fair Value Gap (FV) at this level, and once it fills, it is a great level to start buying before the next wave to the upside.

This would put them at great buy levels as well, especially as altcoins are sitting so close to all-time low levels. However, after the first FVG is filled and there isn’t strong momentum, the second Fibonacci level at 0.500 puts the Bitcoin price at $92,000. Meanwhile, the third and last Fibonacaill level at 0.618 puts it as low as $87,500. “Usually we want to look for a buying opportunity at the 0.382, 0.500, or 0.618 FIB levels,” the crypto analyst explained.
