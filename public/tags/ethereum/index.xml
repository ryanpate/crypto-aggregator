      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, happy Friday! Crypto’s been doing its usual dance: Bitcoin’s been holding strong around $102k after that overnight pop on news of another major bank announcing they’re dipping their toes into BTC custody services. Ethereum’s chilling in the $2,600–$2,650 range, but I’m keeping an eye on a possible breakout if Sunday’s staking rewards update comes through without hiccups. Meanwhile, XRP’s just hanging out near $2.12, flirting with resistance—if that ETF chat heats up again, it could see a quick spike. Personally, I’m tossing a small buy into Litecoin (LTC) this afternoon since it’s been creeping back toward $160 and feels like a low-key play if overall sentiment stays upbeat. Oh, and I snagged a few dollars’ worth of Dogecoin, mostly for old times’ sake and because Elon teased something cryptic about “meme power” in his morning tweet. Who knows, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, so the past couple days in crypto have felt like binge-watching a political thriller—except instead of &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt;, it’s Trump and Musk duking it out on X, and our portfolios are caught in the crossfire. Here’s the lowdown:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump vs. Musk: When Billionaire Beef Meets Blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;On June 5, Elon Musk went full keyboard warrior, ripping into Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (seriously, that’s the name) for gutting EV incentives. He even floated impeaching Trump and starting a new centrist party—bold moves for a guy who just left a White House advisory gig. Naturally, Trump retaliated by threatening to yank Musk’s federal contracts (you know, the ones fueling SpaceX and Tesla) and calling Musk “crazy.” Musk then dropped a bombshell, alleging Trump had ties to the Epstein files—again, via X—so you can imagine how civil this got.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
