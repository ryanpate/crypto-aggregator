As we slide into the weekend, here’s a breezy roundup of what’s been shaking in the markets, which headlines are steering those moves, and exactly which coins I’ll be tinkering with (or trimming) over the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By midweek, CNBC was buzzing about the Fed pausing rate hikes—a move that sent Bitcoin from $109K all the way up to $112K as traders cheered the promise of cheaper money for risk assets. Not long after, Reuters reported oil prices easing when tensions in the Strait of Hormuz cooled off, and we saw Ether dip from $2,820 down to $2,760 before stabilizing just above $2,800. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s scoop on cashback incentives for small crypto buys on popular trading apps has retail volume bubbling up—so don’t be surprised if altcoins get a weekend bump from newcomers chasing those perks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
