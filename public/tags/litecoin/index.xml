      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, happy Friday! Crypto’s been doing its usual dance: Bitcoin’s been holding strong around $102k after that overnight pop on news of another major bank announcing they’re dipping their toes into BTC custody services. Ethereum’s chilling in the $2,600–$2,650 range, but I’m keeping an eye on a possible breakout if Sunday’s staking rewards update comes through without hiccups. Meanwhile, XRP’s just hanging out near $2.12, flirting with resistance—if that ETF chat heats up again, it could see a quick spike. Personally, I’m tossing a small buy into Litecoin (LTC) this afternoon since it’s been creeping back toward $160 and feels like a low-key play if overall sentiment stays upbeat. Oh, and I snagged a few dollars’ worth of Dogecoin, mostly for old times’ sake and because Elon teased something cryptic about “meme power” in his morning tweet. Who knows, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
