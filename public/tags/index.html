      <p>Hey everyone, happy Friday! Crypto’s been doing its usual dance: Bitcoin’s been holding strong around $102k after that overnight pop on news of another major bank announcing they’re dipping their toes into BTC custody services. Ethereum’s chilling in the $2,600–$2,650 range, but I’m keeping an eye on a possible breakout if Sunday’s staking rewards update comes through without hiccups. Meanwhile, XRP’s just hanging out near $2.12, flirting with resistance—if that ETF chat heats up again, it could see a quick spike. Personally, I’m tossing a small buy into Litecoin (LTC) this afternoon since it’s been creeping back toward $160 and feels like a low-key play if overall sentiment stays upbeat. Oh, and I snagged a few dollars’ worth of Dogecoin, mostly for old times’ sake and because Elon teased something cryptic about “meme power” in his morning tweet. Who knows, right?</p>

        Crypto Collision: Trump vs. Musk Sends Markets Reeling

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Hey, so the past couple days in crypto have felt like binge-watching a political thriller—except instead of <em>House of Cards</em>, it’s Trump and Musk duking it out on X, and our portfolios are caught in the crossfire. Here’s the lowdown:</p>
<p><strong>Trump vs. Musk: When Billionaire Beef Meets Blockchain</strong><br>
On June 5, Elon Musk went full keyboard warrior, ripping into Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (seriously, that’s the name) for gutting EV incentives. He even floated impeaching Trump and starting a new centrist party—bold moves for a guy who just left a White House advisory gig. Naturally, Trump retaliated by threatening to yank Musk’s federal contracts (you know, the ones fueling SpaceX and Tesla) and calling Musk “crazy.” Musk then dropped a bombshell, alleging Trump had ties to the Epstein files—again, via X—so you can imagine how civil this got.</p>

        Crypto Collision: Trump vs. Musk Sends Markets Reeling

      <p>Hey, so the past couple days in crypto have felt like binge-watching a political thriller—except instead of <em>House of Cards</em>, it’s Trump and Musk duking it out on X, and our portfolios are caught in the crossfire. Here’s the lowdown:</p>
<p><strong>Trump vs. Musk: When Billionaire Beef Meets Blockchain</strong><br>
On June 5, Elon Musk went full keyboard warrior, ripping into Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (seriously, that’s the name) for gutting EV incentives. He even floated impeaching Trump and starting a new centrist party—bold moves for a guy who just left a White House advisory gig.

        Weekly Crypto Vibes: XRP&#39;s Week in the Spotlight
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Hey there! This week in crypto felt like riding a roller coaster with your eyes closed—thrilling, a bit scary, but mostly fun. Here’s what I noticed from May 28 to June 4, 2025, with a special shout-out to XRP for stealing the show.</p>
<p><strong>XRP’s Unexpected Glow-Up</strong>
I was sipping coffee on May 31 when I saw XRP drop to about $2.08. I nearly spit my coffee out when it shot up to $2.27 by June 4—like, overnight glow-up level. People online were losing their minds (in a good way). Volume was decent, so it wasn’t just bots having fun. If you’re thinking “Woohoo! Let’s buy!” just remember that $2.30–$2.35 is a solid ceiling—so don’t be that person who holds until it drops back down.</p>
